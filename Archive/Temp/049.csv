Six clinical-grade separation procedures were performed, followed by expansion with high-dose interleukin (IL)-2, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 TCR stimulation, and rapamycin for 19 days achieving a median of 8.5-fold (range, 6.25 to 13.7) expansion. FOXP3 expression was stably maintained over the culture period, while the percentage of CD127 was significantly reduced. The in vitro suppression assay showed a strong Mixed Lymphocytes Reaction inhibition. In vitro amplification did not induce any karyotypic modification. To evaluate the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) bifunctional axis, expanded Tregs and conventional T cells (Tcons) were tested in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgnull mice injected with primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, AML cell line, acute lymphoid leukemia Philadelphia cell line, or Burkitt-like lymphoma cell line. All mice that received leukemia cells together with expanded Tregs and Tcons were rescued from leukemia and survived without GVHD, showing that Treg expansion procedure did not compromise GVHD control and the strong Tcon-mediated GVL activity. This report might represent the basis for treating high-risk leukemia and/or relapsed/refractory leukemia patients with high-dose Treg/Tcons.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"Treatment-related mortality (TRM) remains elevated in adult patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT), including an early rise in TRM suggestive of excessive toxicity associated with the standard myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide regimen. In an attempt to reduce regimen-related toxicity, we previously studied a modified myeloablative regimen with TBI (1350 cGy) and fludarabine (160 mg/m(2)); TRM was decreased, but neutrophil engraftment was suboptimal. Therefore, to improve engraftment while still minimizing regimen-related toxicity, we piloted a myeloablative regimen with the addition of thiotepa (10 mg/kg) to TBI and fludarabine conditioning. Thirty-one adult patients (median age, 46 years; range, 19 to 65) with hematologic malignancies (acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 77%; lymphoid malignancy, 23%) underwent single (n = 1) or double (n = 30) UCBT from 2010 to 2015 at our institution. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70% to 97%) by 60 days, with a median time to engraftment of 21 days (95% CI, 19 to 26). The cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment was 77% (95% CI, 57% to 89%) by 100 days, with a median time to engraftment of 47 days (95% CI, 37 to 73). Cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day 100 were 45% (95% CI, 27% to 62%) and 10% (95% CI, 2% to 23%), respectively. The overall incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years was 40% (95% CI, 22% to 57%), with 17% of patients (95% CI, 6% to 33%) experiencing moderate to severe chronic GVHD by 2 years. TRM at 180 days was 13% (95% CI, 4% to 27%), at 1 year 24% (95% CI, 10% to 41%), and at 3 years 30% (95% CI, 13% to 49%). Relapse at 1 year was 13% (95% CI, 4% to 27%) and at 3 years 19% (95% CI, 6% to 38%). With a median follow-up of 35.5 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 52.2), disease-free and overall survival at 3 years were 51% (95% CI, 29% to 69%) and 57% (95% CI, 36% to 73%), respectively. This regimen represents a reasonable alternative to myeloablative conditioning with TBI, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide and warrants further study.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Aim of the study was to compare PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 expression and potential cellular functions in human first and third trimester trophoblast cells, the immortalized first trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo and the choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3. Expression was analyzed by qPCR and immunochemical staining. Functions were evaluated by PIM inhibition followed by analysis of kinetics of cell viability as assessed by MTS assay, proliferation by BrdU assay, and apoptosis by Western blotting for BAD, BCL-XL, (cleaved) PARP, CASP3 and c-MYC. Apoptosis and necrosis were tested by flow cytometry (annexin V/propidium iodide staining). All analyzed PIM kinases are expressed in primary trophoblast cells and both cell lines and are regulated upon stimulation with LIF. Inhibition of PIM kinases significantly reduces viability and proliferation and induces apoptosis. Simultaneously, phosphorylation of c-MYC was reduced. These results demonstrate the involvement of PIM kinases in LIF-induced regulation in different trophoblastic cell lines which may indicate similar functions in primary cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of avascular necrosis of the hip in leukaemia patients treated in our hospital with high doses of corticosteroids in order to evaluate the necessity for an early detection protocol. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational-descriptive and retrospective study from 2005 to 2016 of 253 patients diagnosed with paediatric leukaemia. Patients with musculoskeletal pathology were identified and patients with avascular necrosis were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients (10%) had musculoskeletal symptoms. Three patients with avascular necrosis (1.2%) were analysed. One girl, 7 years old, was treated conservatively with traction - suspension and discharge. Two boys, an 11 and a 15.4 year-old,who developed graft-versus-host disease secondary to bone marrow transplantation, and whose treatment included high doses of corticosteroids, developed avascular necrosis of the hip. One was treated with bisphosphonates and forage and the other ended up with a total hip arthroplasty. DISCUSSION: The occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms during the treatment of leukaemia is different according to the bibliographic series (0.43 -12.6%). Some authors observe an increased risk in female patients between the ages of 10 and 17. A retrospective study reveals that there is a delay of 3.9 months in the diagnosis of CAP since the onset of pain. Other authors relate NAV to loading joints, age and high doses of corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Based on the low incidence of avascular necrosis of the hip in our 14-year-old population treated for leukaemia, the creation of diagnostic protocols seems not to be necessary. However, close monitoring of patients with potential risk factors recognized in the literature, is advisable.","['Copyright (c) 2017 SECOT. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Herein, we report a case of a child presenting Noonan syndrome complicated by juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) and who also developed a multiple form of GCT. We discussed the molecular mechanisms that might account for this association. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A six-year-old boy with Noonan syndrome complicated by JMML presented three asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules on his back, forearm and neck. Histological analysis revealed GCT. A literature review revealed seven cases of Noonan syndrome presenting GCT, none of which were associated with JMML. Mutation of gene PTPN11, via hyperactivation of intracellular Ras signalling may cause the development of GCT and JMML in children presenting Noonan syndrome. DISCUSSION: Detailed clinical examination is recommended in children presenting GCT to screen for multiple forms and for signs of malformation suggestive of a genetic syndrome. Ours is the first case to be described of Noonan syndrome complicated by JMML associated with multiple GCT. This association once again raises the important question of the role of the Ras-MAPK signalling pathway in the development of benign and malignant tumours of solid organs or blood, associated with genetic syndromes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Numb chin syndrome (NCS) is a critical sign of systemic malignancy; however it remains largely unknown by clinicians and dentists. The aim of this study was to investigate NCS that is more often associated with metastatic cancers than with benign diseases. METHODS: Sixteen patients with NCS were diagnosed and treated. The oral and radiographic manifestations were assessed. RESULTS: Four (25%) of 16 patients with NCS were affected by nonmalignant diseases (19% by medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and 6% by osteopetrosis); yet 12 (75%) patient conditions were caused by malignant metastasis, either in the mandible (62%) or intracranial invasion (13%). NCS was unilateral in 13 cases and bilateral in three cases. Mandibular pain and masticatory weakness often dominate the clinical features in NCS associated with cancer metastasis. In two patients, NCS preceded the discovery of unknown malignancy (breast cancer and leukemia). In nine others, NCS heralded malignancy relapse and progression. Metastatic breast cancer in four (36%) cases accounted for the most common malignancy. Other metastatic diseases included two multiple myelomas, and one each of leukemia, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, maxillary sinus adenoid cystic carcinoma and adrenal gland neuroblastoma. Radiographic examinations showed obvious mandibular metastasis with compression of the inferior alveolar nerve or mental nerve in nine patients, and leptomeningeal seeding or intracranial metastasis to the trigeminal nerve root at the skull base in two patients. CONCLUSION: NCS without obvious odontogenic causes or trauma often signals systemic malignancy. It may be the first clue of occult malignancy.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

The dose should be both tolerable and efficacious. This paper describes our experience implementing EffTox in the Matchpoint trial. METHODS: EffTox is a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding trial design that jointly scrutinises binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes. We describe a nomenclature for succinctly describing outcomes in phase I/II dose-finding trials. We use dose-transition pathways, where doses are calculated for each feasible set of outcomes in future cohorts. We introduce the phenomenon of dose ambivalence, where EffTox can recommend different doses after observing the same outcomes. We also describe our experiences with outcome ambiguity, where the categorical evaluation of some primary outcomes is temporarily delayed. RESULTS: We arrived at an EffTox parameterisation that is simulated to perform well over a range of scenarios. In scenarios where dose ambivalence manifested, we were guided by the dose-transition pathways. This technique facilitates planning, and also helped us overcome short-term outcome ambiguity. CONCLUSIONS: EffTox is an efficient and powerful design, but not without its challenges. Joint phase I/II clinical trial designs will likely become increasingly important in coming years as we further investigate non-cytotoxic treatments and streamline the drug approval process. We hope this account of the problems we faced and the solutions we used will help others implement this dose-finding clinical trial design.

However, the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of reduced oxygen tension in embryogenesis remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of oxygen related and antioxidant genes and mitochondrial function in mouse embryo cultured under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, to investigate the beneficial effect of low oxygen tension in preimplantation embryogenesis. METHODS: Two-cell ICR mouse embryos were cultured to blastocysts under different oxygen tension (3% and 20%). The gene expression of oxygen-related proteins (hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF), HIF targets (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF; glucose transporter 3, GLUT-3) and antioxidants (manganese superoxide dismutase, MnSOD; peroxiredoxin 5, PRDX5) were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR and implantation-related protein (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor, LIFR) was validated by immunofluorescence. Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MtMP) and ROS levels were measured by TUNEL, JC-1 and DCFDA assays, respectively. RESULTS: Blastocyst development rate (92.3% vs. 79.4%) and hatch rate (80% vs. 70.4%) were both higher in embryos cultured in 3% O2 than in 20% O2. The transcription levels of MnSOD, PRDX5, VEGF and GLUT-3 also significantly increased in 3% O2 compared with 20% O2 (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence showed that the intensity of staining for HIF-2alpha, MnSOD and LIFR were higher in 3% O2. Blastocysts cultured under 3% O2 exhibited significantly higher MtMP compared with 20% O2. ROS and Apoptosis levels were significantly higher in the 20% O2 group than in the 3% O2 group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low O2 tension may improve embryo viability by increasing expression of antioxidant enzymes and glucose transporter activities. It provides an environment conducive to viability by upregulation of LIFR/VEGF and increased MtMP which could enhance implantation potential and reduce apoptosis in mouse blastocyst. These effects may be initiated and regulated by HIF-2alpha, a key mediator in a hypoxic environment.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidant', 'Hypoxia', 'Implantation', 'Mitochondria', 'Mouse embryo']",,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",PMC5520294,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7445-0261'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of our review is to highlight the significance of microsatellite hypervariation in diagnostics of hematologic malignancies. METHODS: For the past few decades, extensive experiments in cancer research have explored all the possible pathways and a number of deleterious mutations that either make the tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) dysfunctional or cause the proto-oncogenes to behave abnormally by changing the cellular phenotype hence rendering disease. To prevent the deleterious effects of mutations and to protect the genomic integrity, our system possesses multiple repair mechanisms. DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Direct Reversal of Damage (DRD) are two repair mechanisms which help in removal of faulty base pairs and alkyl adduct formation respectively to avoid long term effects of toxicity, tumorigenesis and mutagenesis. There are nine major MMR genes - MutS homolog (MSH2, MSH3, MSH4, MSH5, MSH6), MutL homolog (MLH1, MLH3), human post-meiotic segregation genes (PMS1, PMS2), and three major damage reversal genes - O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), ABH2 and DEPC1. RESULTS: Any malfunction in DNA repair machinery can cause microsatellite instability (MSI), a form of genomic abnormality with hyper mutable repeats that is directly associated with cancer. Microsatellites are short, repetitive sequences, non-randomly distributed and localized in 3'-UTR (Untranslated Region), introns, coding regions and promoters. Besides MSI, evidence on promoter hypermethylation of selected repair genes also points toward a prominent reason for cancer initiation and progression. CONCLUSION: The presence of specific microsatellite marker hyper-mutability and consistent promoter hypermethylation in leukemia or lymphoma can be considered as a part of routine diagnostic test in clinical laboratories.",,['NOTNLM'],"['DRD', 'MMR', 'MSI', 'diagnostics', 'hypermethylation']",,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7941-602X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have linked Flt3-ITD to the activation of the Fes protein tyrosine kinase in AML, and RNAi-knockdown studies suggest that Fes may be required for Flt3 function. In this study, we tested Fes inhibitors from three different chemical classes for their growth-suppressive activity against Flt3-ITD+ myeloid leukemia cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13 and MOLM-14) vs. myeloid cells with wild-type Flt3 (THP-1). All Fes inhibitors selectively inhibited the growth of Flt3-ITD+ AML cells, with IC50 values for diaminopyrimidine and pyrrolopyridine inhibitors ranging from 19 to 166 nM. In contrast, a pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitor was less potent in Flt3-ITD+ AML cells, with IC50 values in the 1.0 muM range. In vitro kinase assays showed that the most potent inhibitors of Flt3-ITD+ AML cell proliferation blocked both Fes and Flt3-ITD kinase activity, while the pyrazolopyrimidine was more selective for Fes vs. Flt3-ITD. All three inhibitors induced significant apoptosis in Flt3-ITD+ AML cells, with potency equivalent to or greater than the established Flt3-ITD inhibitor, tandutinib. Transformation of TF-1 cells with Flt3-ITD resulted in constitutive activation of endogenous Fes, and rendered the cells highly sensitive to all three Fes inhibitors with IC50 values in the 30-500 nM range. The pyrrolopyridine compound also induced apoptotic responses in patient-derived Flt3-ITD+ AML bone marrow cells but not in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that Fes kinase activity contributes to Flt3-ITD signaling in AML, and suggests that dual inhibition of both Flt3 and Fes may provide a therapeutic advantage for the treatment of Flt3-ITD+ AML.",,,,['R21 CA185702/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (HG7-92-01)', '0 (NVP-TAE684)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (WZ4-49-1)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",PMC5519068,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5238-3806'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a natural product, AHCC has potential to create safer adjuvant therapies in cancer patients. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the least curable and second-most common leukemia in adults. AML is especially terminal to those over 60 years old, where median survival is only 5 to 10 months, due to inability to receive intensive chemotherapy. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AHCC on AML cells both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that AHCC induced Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in AML cell lines as well as in primary AML leukopheresis samples. Additionally, AHCC induced Caspase-8 cleavage as well as Fas and TRAIL upregulation, suggesting involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In contrast, monocytes from healthy donors showed suppressed Caspase-3 cleavage and lower cell death. When tested in a murine engraftment model of AML, AHCC led to significantly increased survival time and decreased blast counts. These results uncover a mechanism by which AHCC leads to AML-cell specific death, and also lend support for the further investigation of AHCC as a potential adjuvant for the treatment of AML.",,,,"['R01 CA162411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 AI124156/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA217006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA203584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'S1W5KTD68Y (Active Hexose Correlated Compound)']",PMC5519206,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7328-7853'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identified KMT2A as a potential target, which promoted the growth of human melanoma cells. KMT2A knockdown significantly inhibited cell viability and cell migration and induced apoptosis, whereas KMT2A overexpression effectively promoted cell proliferation in various melanoma cell lines. Further study showed that KMT2A regulated melanoma cell growth by targeting the hTERT-dependent signal pathway. Knockdown of KMT2A markedly inhibited the promoter activity and expression of hTERT, and hTERT overexpression rescued the viability inhibition caused by KMT2A knockdown. Moreover, KMT2A knockdown suppressed tumorsphere formation and the expression of cancer stem cell markers, which was also reversed by hTERT overexpression. In addition, the results from a xenograft mouse model confirmed that KMT2A promoted melanoma growth via hTERT signaling. Finally, analyses of clinical samples demonstrated that the expression of KMT2A and hTERT were positively correlated in melanoma tumor tissues, and KMT2A high expression predicted poor prognosis in melanoma patients. Collectively, our results indicate that KMT2A promotes melanoma growth by activating the hTERT signaling, suggesting that the KMT2A/hTERT signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.",,,,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",PMC5550845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach to reversing epigenetic suppression of tumor suppressor genes is to inhibit DNA methyl transferase. 5-aza-2',2'-diflurorodeoxycytidine (NUC013) is a novel DNA methyl transferase and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that is a more potent inhibitor of growth than decitabine in the NCI 60 cancer cell line panel. NUC013 is more active than decitabine against p53-null/mutant cancer cell lines (p = 0.027) but is even more so against p53 wild-type (WT) cell lines (p = 0.0025). The maximum tolerated dose in mice of NUC013 is greater than 120 mg/kg administered intravenously for three consecutive days a week for three weeks. With this regimen and a dose of 20 mg/kg in a human leukemia HL-60 (p53-null) NCr-nu/nu mouse xenograft model (n = 10/group), NUC013 demonstrated a survival benefit (saline median survival (MS) = 26.5 days, NUC013 MS = 32 days and hazard ratio (HR) = 0.26 (p = 0.032)).

Proceeding from this, the goal of our work was to find the clinical-laboratory features, indicating the expected relapse and require the urgent molecular research carry out. In order to find the clinical-hematologic indicators of the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia expected relapse, BCR-ABL gene quantitative determination using the PSR method after the Imatinib treatment was done in 64 patients with CML who had remission (duration 0,5-14 years).

Epub 2017 Aug 7.,"Polymer carriers based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers with incorporated organic nitrates as nitric oxide (NO) donors were designed with the aim to localise NO generation in solid tumours, thus highly increasing the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The NO donors were coupled to the polymer carrier either through a stable bond or through a hydrolytically degradable, pH sensitive, bond. In vivo, the co-administration of the polymer NO donor and HPMA copolymer-bound cytotoxic drug (doxorubicin; Dox) resulted in an improvement in the treatment of murine EL4 T-cell lymphoma. The polymer NO donors neither potentiated the in vitro toxicity of the cytotoxic drug nor exerted any effect on in vivo model without the EPR effect, such as BCL1 leukaemia. Thus, an increase in passive accumulation of the nanomedicine carrying cytotoxic drug via NO-enhanced EPR effect was the operative mechanism of action. The most significant improvement in the therapy was observed in a combination treatment with such a polymer conjugate of Dox, which is characterised by increased circulation in the blood and efficient accumulation in solid tumours. Notably, the combination treatment enabled the development of an anti-tumour immune response, which was previously demonstrated as an important feature of HPMA-based polymer cytotoxic drugs.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug delivery', 'EL4 lymphoma', 'HPMA copolymers', 'anti-tumour immune response', 'enhanced EPR effect', 'polymer NO donor', 'polymer cytotoxic drugs', 'solid tumour treatment']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (Polymers)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 19.,"OBJECTIVES: Corticosteroid treatment of paediatric leukaemia patients can lead to osteonecrosis (ON). We determined whether bone marrow oedema (BME) is an early sign of progressive ON and eventual bone collapse. METHODS: In a retrospective study, two radiologists reviewed MR imaging characteristics of 47 early stage epiphyseal ON in 15 paediatric and adolescent leukaemia patients. Associations between BME on initial imaging studies and subchondral fracture, disease progression and bone collapse were assessed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Differences in time to progression and bone collapse between lesions with and without oedema were assessed by log rank tests. RESULTS: Forty-seven occurrences of ON were located in weight bearing joints, with 77% occurring in the femur. Seventeen lesions progressed to collapse, two lesions worsened without collapse, and 28 remained stable or improved. BME was significantly associated with subchondral fracture (p = 0.0014), disease progression (p = 0.0015), and bone collapse (p < 0.001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 77%, respectively, for bone collapse. Time to progression for ON with oedema was 2.7 years (95% CI: 1.7-3.4); while the majority of no-oedema ON were stable (p = 0.0011). CONCLUSIONS: BME is an early sign of progressive ON and eventual bone collapse in paediatric and adolescent leukaemia patients. KEY POINTS: * Bone marrow oedema in corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis predicts progression to bone collapse. * Bone marrow oedema is associated with subchondral fractures in corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis. * Bone marrow oedema can be used to stratify patients to joint-preserving interventions. * Absence of bone marrow oedema can justify a ""wait and watch"" approach.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Fractures, Bone', 'Oedema', 'Osteonecrosis']","['R01 AR054458/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', '3R01AR054458-S1/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin', 'Diseases', 'Moskowitz Award for Radiology Resident Research/Stanford University School of', 'Medicine (US), Department of Radiology']",['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],PMC5718952,['NIHMS894242'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 19.,"We evaluated clinical characteristics and outcome on imatinib of 22 patients with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRB. Median age was 49 years (range 20-80), 91% were male. Fifteen different PDGFRB fusion genes were identified. Eosinophilia was absent in 4/19 (21%) cases and only 11/19 (58%) cases had eosinophils >/=1.5x10(9)/L. On imatinib, 17/17 (100%) patients in chronic phase achieved complete hematologic remission after median 2 months (range 0-13). Complete cytogenetic remission and/or complete molecular remission by RT-PCR were achieved in 12/13 (92%) and 12/14 patients (86%) after median 10 (range 3-34) and 19 months (range 7-110), respectively. In patients with blast phase (myeloid, n = 2; lymphoid, n = 3), treatment included combinations of imatinib (n = 5), intensive chemotherapy (n = 3), and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 3). All 3 transplanted patients (complex karyotype, n = 2) experienced early relapse. Initially, patients were treated with imatinib 400 mg/day (n = 15) or 100 mg/day (n = 7), the dose was reduced from 400 mg/day to 100 mg/day during follow-up in 9 patients. After a median treatment of 71 months (range 1-135), the 5-year survival rate was 83%; 4/22 (18%) patients died (chronic phase; n = 2; blast phase, n = 2) due to progression (n = 3) or comorbidity while in remission (n = 1).

This binding increases the proliferation and prolongs the survival of normal mature MCs, as well as intensifies the release of mediators. In mastocytosis, somatic mutations of the coding Kit gene cause autocrine dysregulation and lead to constitutive KIT activation even in the absence of its ligand SCF. Clinical symptoms are caused by MC-mediator release and/or infiltration of MCs into tissues. Aberrant KIT activation may result in increased production of MCs in the skin and extracutaneous organs. Depending on the affected organ(s), the disease can be divided into cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), systemic mastocytosis (SM), and localized MC tumors. The updated classification of WHO discriminates between several distinct subvariants of CM and SM. While the prognosis in CM and indolent SM (ISM) is excellent with (almost) normal life expectancy, the prognosis in aggressive SM (ASM) and MC leukemia (MCL) is dismal. The symptoms may comprise urticaria, angioedema, flush, pruritus, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypotension, syncope, and musculoskeletal pain and are the results of MC infiltration and mediator release into target organs, i.e., the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Mastocytosis differs from a lot of other hematological disorders because its pathology is not only based on the lack of normal function of a specific pathway or of a specific cell type but additionally is a proliferative disease.

This epigenetic mark was recently reported as a potential biomarker for multiple types of cancer, but its application in the clinic is limited by the utility of recent 5hmC quantification assays. We use a recently developed, ultra-sensitive, fluorescence-based single-molecule method for global quantification of 5hmC in genomic DNA. The high sensitivity of the method gives access to precise quantification of extremely low 5hmC levels common in many cancers. METHODS: We assessed 5hmC levels in DNA extracted from a set of colon and blood cancer samples and compared 5hmC levels with healthy controls, in a single-molecule approach. RESULTS: Using our method, we observed a significantly reduced level of 5hmC in blood and colon cancers and could distinguish between colon tumor and colon tissue adjacent to the tumor based on the global levels of this molecular biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: Single-molecule detection of 5hmC allows distinguishing between malignant and healthy tissue in clinically relevant and accessible tissue such as blood and colon. The presented method outperforms current commercially available quantification kits and may potentially be developed into a widely used, 5hmC quantification assay for research and clinical diagnostics. Furthermore, using this method, we confirm that 5hmC is a good molecular biomarker for diagnosing colon and various types of blood cancer.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*5-hydroxymethylcytosine', '*5hmC', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Blood cancer', '*CRC', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Colon cancer', '*Multiple myeloma', '*Single-molecule']",['337830/European Research Council/International'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)']",PMC5512773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been used to redirect the specificity of autologous T cells against leukemia and lymphoma with promising clinical results. Extending this approach to allogeneic T cells is problematic as they carry a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Natural killer (NK) cells are highly cytotoxic effectors, killing their targets in a non-antigen-specific manner without causing GVHD. Cord blood (CB) offers an attractive, allogeneic, off-the-self source of NK cells for immunotherapy. We transduced CB-derived NK cells with a retroviral vector incorporating the genes for CAR-CD19, IL-15 and inducible caspase-9-based suicide gene (iC9), and demonstrated efficient killing of CD19-expressing cell lines and primary leukemia cells in vitro, with marked prolongation of survival in a xenograft Raji lymphoma murine model. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) production by the transduced CB-NK cells critically improved their function. Moreover, iC9/CAR.19/IL-15 CB-NK cells were readily eliminated upon pharmacologic activation of the iC9 suicide gene. In conclusion, we have developed a novel approach to immunotherapy using engineered CB-derived NK cells, which are easy to produce, exhibit striking efficacy and incorporate safety measures to limit toxicity. This approach should greatly improve the logistics of delivering this therapy to large numbers of patients, a major limitation to current CAR-T-cell therapies.",,,,"['P30 CA016086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI067946/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",PMC6063081,['NIHMS953741'],,,,['Cancer Discov. 2017 Oct;7(10):OF2.

Print 2017 Oct 15.,"Baboons naturally infected with simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV) are a potentially useful model system for the study of vaccination against human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Here we expanded the number of available full-length baboon STLV-1 sequences from one to three and related the T cell responses that recognize the immunodominant Tax protein to the tax sequences present in two individual baboons. Continuously growing T cell lines were established from two baboons, animals 12141 and 12752. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of complete STLV genome sequences from these T cell lines revealed them to be closely related but distinct from each other and from the baboon STLV-1 sequence in the NCBI sequence database. Overlapping peptides corresponding to each unique Tax sequence and to the reference baboon Tax sequence were used to analyze recognition by T cells from each baboon using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Individual baboons expressed more gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha in response to Tax peptides corresponding to their own STLV-1 sequence than in response to Tax peptides corresponding to the reference baboon STLV-1 sequence. Thus, our analyses revealed distinct but closely related STLV-1 genome sequences in two baboons, extremely low heterogeneity of STLV sequences within each baboon, no evidence for superinfection within each baboon, and a ready ability of T cells in each baboon to recognize circulating Tax sequences. While amino acid substitutions that result in escape from CD8(+) T cell recognition were not observed, premature stop codons were observed in 7% and 56% of tax sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from animals 12141 and 12752, respectively.IMPORTANCE It has been estimated that approximately 100,000 people suffer serious morbidity and 10,000 people die each year from the consequences associated with human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection. There are no antiviral drugs and no preventive vaccine. A preventive vaccine would significantly impact the global burden associated with HTLV infections. Here we provide fundamental information on the simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV) naturally transmitted in a colony of captive baboons. The limited viral sequence heterogeneity in individual baboons, the identity of the viral gene product that is the major target of cellular immune responses, the persistence of viral amino acid sequences that are the major targets of cellular immune responses, and the emergence in vivo of truncated variants in the major target of cellular immune responses all parallel what are seen with HTLV infection of humans. These results justify the use of STLV-infected baboons as a model system for vaccine development efforts.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Papio anubis', '*Tax', '*intracellular cytokine staining', '*next generation sequencing', '*simian T-cell leukemia virus']","['P51 OD011133/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 RR013986/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",PMC5625486,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1773-2406', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6851-3003']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2017 Oct 1.,"We previously reported that the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax301-309-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (Tax301-309-CTLs) was highly restricted and a particular amino acid sequence motif, the PDR motif, was conserved among HLA-A*24:02-positive (HLA-A*24:02(+)) adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Furthermore, we found that donor-derived PDR(+) CTLs selectively expanded in ATL long-term HSCT survivors with strong CTL activity against HTLV-1. On the other hand, the TCR repertoires in Tax301-309-CTLs of asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) remain unclear. In this study, we directly identified the DNA sequence of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR-beta chain of Tax301-309-CTLs at the single-cell level and compared not only the TCR repertoires but also the frequencies and phenotypes of Tax301-309-CTLs between ACs and ATL patients. We did not observe any essential difference in the frequencies of Tax301-309-CTLs between ACs and ATL patients. In the single-cell TCR repertoire analysis of Tax301-309-CTLs, 1,458 Tax301-309-CTLs and 140 clones were identified in this cohort. Tax301-309-CTLs showed highly restricted TCR repertoires with a strongly biased usage of BV7, and PDR, the unique motif in TCR-beta CDR3, was exclusively observed in all ACs and ATL patients. However, there was no correlation between PDR(+) CTL frequencies and HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL). In conclusion, we have identified, for the first time, a unique amino acid sequence, PDR, as a public TCR-CDR3 motif against Tax in HLA-A*24:02(+) HTLV-1-infected individuals. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the role of the PDR(+) CTL response in the progression from carrier state to ATL.IMPORTANCE ATL is an aggressive T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1 infection. The HTLV-1 regulatory protein Tax aggressively promotes the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes and is also a major target antigen for CD8(+) CTLs. In our previous evaluation of Tax301-309-CTLs, we found that a unique amino acid sequence motif, PDR, in CDR3 of the TCR-beta chain of Tax301-309-CTLs was conserved among ATL patients after allo-HSCT. Furthermore, the PDR(+) Tax301-309-CTL clones selectively expanded and showed strong cytotoxic activities against HTLV-1. On the other hand, it remains unclear how Tax301-309-CTL repertoire exists in ACs. In this study, we comprehensively compared Tax-specific TCR repertoires at the single-cell level between ACs and ATL patients. Tax301-309-CTLs showed highly restricted TCR repertoires with a strongly biased usage of BV7, and PDR, the unique motif in TCR-beta CDR3, was conserved in all ACs and ATL patients, regardless of clinical subtype in HTLV-1 infection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1 Tax', '*T-cell receptor', '*cytotoxic T cells', '*single-cell repertoire analysis']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A24 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",PMC5599769,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ErbB4) expression levels were inversely correlated to renal fibrosis in human fibrotic kidneys. In both unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and ischemia-reperfusion injury followed by uninephrectomy (IRI/UNx) mouse models, expression levels of ErbB4 were elevated in the early stage of renal injury. Using mice with global ErbB4 deletion except for transgenic rescue in cardiac tissue ( ErbB4(-/-)ht(+)), we determined that UUO induced similar injury in proximal tubules compared with wild-type mice but more severe injury in distal nephrons. TIF was apparent earlier and was more pronounced following UUO in ErbB4(-/-)ht(+) mice. With ErbB4 deletion, UUO injury inhibited protein kinase B phosphorylation and increased the percentage of cells in G2/M arrest. There was also increased nuclear immunostaining of yes-associated protein and increased expression of phospho-Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3, snail1, and vimentin. These results indicate that ErbB4 deletion accelerates the development and progression of renal fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy. Similar results were found in a mouse IRI/UNx model. In conclusion, increased expression of ErbB4 in the early stages of renal injury may reflect a compensatory effect to lessen tubulointerstitial injury.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4', '*cell cycle', '*epithelial dedifferentiation', '*tubulointerstitial fibrosis']",,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Snai1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vim protein, mouse)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Yap1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",PMC6031915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of BCL-2 has long been known to be a crucial part of the pathophysiology of B-cell lymphomas; however, several early attempts to target this pathway therapeutically were unsuccessful because of toxicity, lack of efficacy, or both. Recently, a highly potent and selective oral BCL-2 antagonist, venetoclax, was approved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where it has proven to be highly active, even in patients with high-risk del(17p) disease. Venetoclax has also demonstrated efficacy in other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes, in particular mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Here, I review the history of targeting BCL-2 in B-cell lymphomas, and I discuss recent data on venetoclax used as monotherapy and in combination with monoclonal antibodies, chemotherapy, and other novel agents. I also discuss how genomic and functional approaches such as BH3 profiling may allow us to prioritize novel-agent combinations for further study in clinical trials. These approaches may also help us to understand resistance mechanisms to BCL-2-selective therapy and how to overcome resistance. Finally, I provide my perspective on how to move BCL-2-directed therapies forward toward a goal of developing well-tolerated, time-limited combination regimens with curative potential for patients with B-cell lymphomas.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"OBJECTIVE While a direct relation between hospital construction and concomitant infection rates has been clearly established, few data are available regarding the environmental decontamination effects of renovation in which surfaces are replaced and regarding subsequent infection incidence. DESIGN Retrospective clinical study with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) molecular strain typing and environmental cultures. SETTING A regional referral center for acute leukemia and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. PATIENTS Overall, 536 consecutive hospital admissions for newly diagnosed acute leukemia or a first autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation were reviewed. INTERVENTION During 2009-2010, our unit underwent complete remodeling including replacement of all surfaces. We assessed the effects of this construction on the incidence of hospital-acquired VRE colonization before, during, and after the renovation. RESULTS We observed a sharp decrease in VRE colonization rates (hazard ratio, <0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.44; P<.0001) during the first year after the renovation, with a return to near baseline rates thereafter. The known risk factors for VRE colonization appeared to be stable over the study interval. Environmental cultures outside of patient rooms revealed several contaminated areas that are commonly touched by unit personnel. Multilocus sequence typing of VRE isolates that were cryopreserved over the study interval showed that dominant strains prior to construction disappeared and were replaced by other strains after the renovation. CONCLUSIONS Unit reconstruction interrupted endemic transmission of VRE, which resumed with novel strains upon reopening. Contamination of environmental surfaces and shared equipment may play an important role in endemic transmission of VRE.

Some lncRNAs modulate the expression of chromosomally adjacent genes. Here, we assess the roles of the lncRNA CASC15 in regulation of a chromosomally nearby gene, SOX4, and its function in RUNX1/AML translocated leukemia. RESULTS: CASC15 is a conserved lncRNA that was upregulated in pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with t (12; 21) as well as pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t (8; 21), both of which are associated with relatively better prognosis. Enforced expression of CASC15 led to a myeloid bias in development, and overall, decreased engraftment and colony formation. At the cellular level, CASC15 regulated cellular survival, proliferation, and the expression of its chromosomally adjacent gene, SOX4. Differentially regulated genes following CASC15 knockdown were enriched for predicted transcriptional targets of the Yin and Yang-1 (YY1) transcription factor. Interestingly, we found that CASC15 enhances YY1-mediated regulation of the SOX4 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent the first characterization of this CASC15 in RUNX1-translocated leukemia, and point towards a mechanistic basis for its action.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-all', '*CASC15', '*ETV6-RUNX1', '*Non-coding RNA', '*SOX4']","['R25 GM055052/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL086345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA175426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI028697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (SOX4 protein, human)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)']",PMC5517805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical impact of ETS2 expression in AML remains unknown. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of ETS2 expression using two relatively large cohorts of AML patients. RESULTS: In the first cohort, compared to low expression of ETS2 (ETS2 (low)), high expression of ETS2 (ETS2 (high)) showed significant shorter OS, EFS and RFS in the current treatments including the allogeneic HCT group (n = 72) and the chemotherapy group (n = 100). Notably, among ETS2 (high) patients, those received allogeneic HCT had longer OS, EFS and RFS than those with chemotherapy alone (allogeneic HCT, n = 39 vs. chemotherapy, n = 47), but treatment modules play insignificant role in the survival of ETS2 (low) patients (allogeneic HCT, n = 33 vs. chemotherapy, n = 53). Moreover, gene/microRNA expression data provides insights into the biological changes associated with varying ETS2 expression levels in AML. The prognostic value of ETS2 was further validated in the second AML cohort (n = 329).

METHODS: A Markov model combined with clinical effectiveness, utility, and cost data was used. The sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the model outcomes. The impact of patient assistance programs (PAPs) was assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with dasatinib is expected to produce 3.65, 0.59, and 0.15 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in comparison with high-dose imatinib (600 and 800 mg) and nilotinib, respectively. When a PAP was available, dasatinib yielded an incremental cost of $16,417 per QALY compared to imatinib (600 mg) and was cost-saving compared to imatinib (800 mg) and nilotinib.

Our aims were to carry out a longitudinal study to investigate the trends and spatial inequalities of incidence and survival of leukaemia, and the association between survival and deprivation in Hungary. All cases of childhood leukaemia and myelodysplasia were analysed (3157 cases, 1971-2015, age: 0-14 years). Time trends and the annual percentage change in direct standardized incidence and mortality were assessed. Survival and association with deprivation were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. Incidence rates of leukaemia (23.5-56.0/million) increased with an average annual percent change (AAPC) of 1%, determined by an increase in the incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (14.6-39.2/million, AAPC: 1.25%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant improvement in overall survival over the study period. Starting from 25% of cases surviving 5 years in the 70s; the overall 5-year survival reached 80% by 2010. Survival differences were observed with sex, leukaemia type and age at diagnosis. A reverse association was found in the survival probability of leukaemia by degree of deprivation. The Cox proportional hazards model verified a significant reverse association with deprivation [hazard ratio=1.08 (1.04-1.12)]. This is the first nationwide study to confirm the prognostic role of deprivation on the basis of a large cohort of patients with childhood leukaemia during a 45-year period. To maintain further improvement in treatment results, it is important to detect inequalities. Our results showed that deprivation may also be important in the survival of leukaemia.",,,,,,,,,,['Hungarian Paediatric Haemato-Oncology Network'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated DAMPs following chemotherapy and their relationship with markers of immunoparalysis in leukemia patients. In 6 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and 12 healthy subjects, DAMPs, cytokines, and markers of immunoparalysis were determined before and during the first week after chemotherapy initiation. In the patients, plasma levels of nuclear DNA (a marker of general DAMP release) were profoundly increased before chemotherapy and further increased 4-6 h afterwards, while the specific DAMP mitochondrial DNA showed only a trend towards increase. Circulating cytokine levels did not change following chemotherapy. Leukocyte cytokine production capacity and HLA-DR expression were similar in patients and healthy controls until day 4 when leukocytes were found to be virtually absent. In conclusion, in the early phase following chemotherapy in leukemia patients, increased DAMP release does not induce immunoparalysis.","['(c) 2017 S.

We found that the histone acetyltransferase general control non-derepressible 5 (GCN5) is essential for iNKT cell development during the maturation stage. GCN5 deficiency blocked iNKT cell development in a cell-intrinsic manner. At the molecular level, GCN5 is a specific lysine acetyltransferase of early growth responsive gene 2 (EGR2), a transcription factor required for iNKT cell development. GCN5-mediated acetylation positively regulated EGR2 transcriptional activity, and both genetic and pharmacological GCN5 suppression specifically inhibited the transcription of EGR2 target genes in iNKT cells, including Runx1, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), interleukin (IL)-2Rb, and T-bet.

The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA) is the most effective pharmacological option, but only approximately 50% of patients respond. A response only manifests after many months of treatment and is transient. The reasons underlying AZA resistance are unknown, and few alternatives exist for non-responders. Here, we show that AZA responders have more hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in the cell cycle. Non-responder HPC quiescence is mediated by integrin alpha5 (ITGA5) signaling and their hematopoietic potential improved by combining AZA with an ITGA5 inhibitor. AZA response is associated with the induction of an inflammatory response in HPCs in vivo. By molecular bar coding and tracking individual clones, we found that, although AZA alters the sub-clonal contribution to different lineages, founder clones are not eliminated and continue to drive hematopoiesis even in complete responders.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

We compare the decrease in H3K4 methylation and de-regulation of gene expression in hippocampal neurons of mice with knockdown of either Kmt2a or Kmt2b. Kmt2a and Kmt2b control largely distinct genomic regions and different molecular pathways linked to neuronal plasticity. Finally, we show that the decrease in H3K4 methylation resulting from Kmt2a knockdown partially recapitulates the pattern previously reported in CK-p25 mice, a model for neurodegeneration and memory impairment.

Although clinical evidence suggests that VNC causes peripheral neuropathy in children, the degree to which pediatric chemotherapeutic regimens influence pain sensitivity throughout life remains unclear, in part because of the lack of an established animal model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain during early life. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of VNC exposure between postnatal days (P) 11 and 21 on mechanical and thermal pain sensitivity in the developing rat. Low doses of VNC (15 or 30 mug/kg) failed to alter nociceptive withdrawal reflexes at any age examined compared with vehicle-injected littermate controls. Meanwhile, high dose VNC (60 mug/kg) evoked mechanical hypersensitivity in both sexes beginning at P26 that persisted until adulthood and included both static and dynamic mechanical allodynia. Hind paw withdrawal latencies to noxious heat and cold were unaffected by high doses of VNC, suggesting a selective effect of neonatal VNC on mechanical pain sensitivity. Gross and fine motor function appeared normal after VNC treatment, although a small decrease in weight gain was observed. The VNC regimen also produced a significant decrease in intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the hind paw skin by P33. Overall, the present results demonstrate that high-dose administration of VNC during the early postnatal period selectively evokes a mechanical hypersensitivity that is slow to emerge during adolescence, providing further evidence that aberrant sensory input during early life can have prolonged consequences for pain processing.",,,,['R01 NS080889/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (UCHL1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",PMC5643007,['NIHMS876486'],,,,['Pain. 2017 Sep;158(9):1627-1628.

They function at the post-translation level controlling chromatin conformation and gene transcription. KDM1A is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase, overexpressed in several tumor types, including acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. Among the many known monoamine oxidase inhibitors screened for KDM1A inhibition, tranylcypromine emerged as a moderately active hit, which irreversibly binds to the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. MATERIAL & METHODS: The KDM1A inhibitors 5a-w were synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo. The biochemical potency was determined, modulation of target in cells was demonstrated on KDM1A-dependent genes and the anti-clonogenic activity was performed in murine acute promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) blasts. An in vivo efficacy experiment was conducted using an established murine promyelocytic leukemia model. RESULTS: We report a new series of tranylcypromine derivatives substituted on the cyclopropyl moiety, endowed with high potency in both biochemical and cellular assays.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other plasmonic techniques such as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and imaging SPR are reaching a maturity level sufficient for their application in monitoring biomolecules in clinical samples. In recent years, the first examples for monitoring antibodies, proteins, enzymes, drugs, small molecules, peptides, and nucleic acids in biofluids collected from patients afflicted with a series of medical conditions (Alzheimer's, hepatitis, diabetes, leukemia, and cancers such as prostate and breast cancers, among others) demonstrate the progress of SPR sensing in clinical chemistry. This Perspective reviews the current status of the field, showcasing a series of early successes in the application of SPR for clinical analysis and detailing a series of considerations regarding sensing schemes, exposing issues with analysis in biofluids, and comparing SPR with ELISA, while providing an outlook of the challenges currently associated with plasmonic materials, instrumentation, microfluidics, bioreceptor selection, selection of a clinical market, and validation of a clinical assay for applying SPR sensors to clinical samples.

Epub 2017 Jul 18.,"INTRODUCTION: The identification of aberrancies in leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is quite important in the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). This study, the first from Iraq, aimed to assess the frequency and patterns of LAIP among Iraqi patients with ALL, to establish future strategies for evaluating MRD. METHODS: A total of 282 newly diagnosed Iraqi ALL cases were analyzed with six-parameter flow cytometry using a panel of 29 monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Immunological subtyping revealed that 85.5% of cases were B-ALL and the remainder T-ALL. LAIP was detected in 97.1% of B-ALL, and in 26.8% of T-ALL. The asynchronous maturation-associated antigen patterns in B-ALL were CD10(strong+) /TdT(dim+) , CD38(dim+) /CD34(+) , CD10(dim+) /CD34(+) , CD10(strong) /CD20(strong+) , CD20(strong+) /CD34(+,) and CD45(dim+) /CD20(strong+) in 84.6%, while the cross-lineage myeloid expression was seen in 81.3% and aberrant T-cell antigen expression in 6.2%. For T-ALL, asynchronous maturation-associated antigen patterns included the following: CD1a(+) /CD5(+) /sCD3(+) and CD34(+) /sCD3(+) in 12.2%. Myeloid and B-cell antigen expression were each identified in 7.3% of T-ALL. No significant differences in LAIP were found between children and adults. CONCLUSION: The high rates and the patterns of LAIP particularly in Iraqi B-ALL patients may allow the development of more cost-effective strategies for MRD monitoring.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'immunophenotyping', 'minimal residual disease']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6025-9802'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 4.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, both interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the B-cell receptor (BCR) activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and induce the phosphorylation of signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on tyrosine 705 residues. However, whereas IL-6 phosphorylates STAT3 within 15 min, stimulation of the BCR with anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies phosphorylates STAT3 in 2-4 hr. Here, we show that this process takes longer because it requires transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. Using an electromobility shift assay, we found that incubation with IgM antibodies for 4 or 18 hr, but not 15 min, increased NF-kappaB DNA-binding of CLL cells and increased binding was translated to increased transcriptional activity. Hence, 42% of the 83 NF-kappaB target genes were constitutively expressed in all CLL cells prior to any inducible stimuli. However, activation of the BCR increased the number of NF-kappaB target genes with detectable expression by 23%. Remarkably, prolonged incubation with anti-IgM antibodies induced a time-dependent transcription, production and secretion of IL-6 protein. The IgM-induced production of IL-6 prompted the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine residues. This effect was inhibited by the JAK1/2 inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 pathway ruxolitinib. Taken together, these results suggest that in CLL cells, constitutive tonic activation of NF-kappaB can be further enhanced by the BCR and that the BCR-induced activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway depends on the NF-kappaB induced production of IL-6.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic Leukemia', '*nuclear factor kappaB', '*phosphorylation', '*signal transducer and activator of transcription 3']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",PMC5749978,['NIHMS929477'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1623-3613'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phyto-compounds bearing isoquinoline alkaloids have been reported to show a potential effect against a number of human cancers cell lines including leukemia. We hypothesized that L-THP, being an isoquinoline alkaloid, could be a potential molecule against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in this study, we evaluate L-THP against p53 deficient leukemia EU-4 cell lines in vitro. METHODS: For the study, p53 null leukemia EU-4 cells were used and treated with LTHP. The extent of apoptosis and viability of cells were determined. Expression of apoptosis related proteins such as XIAP and MDM2 was done by western blot and PCR studies. The expression of MDM2 and XIAP was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA). RESULTS: Outcomes of the study suggested that L-THP caused p53-indipendent apoptosis mediated by XIAP in EU-4 cells. The treatment of L-THP caused a decrease in the levels of XIAP protein with increasing dose and time. L-THP caused down-regulation of XIAP protein via inhibiting the expression of MDM2 and involving proteasomedependent pathway. Also, the outcomes of experiments suggested increased sensitivity of leukemia cells towards doxorubicin due to the inhibition of XIAP by L-THP or by siRNA. CONCLUSION: Findings of the study confirm that L-THP resulted in p53 independent apoptosis via down-regulating XIAP protein by inhibiting MDM2 associated with proteasome-dependent pathway and increased sensitivity of EU-4 cells against doxorubicin. L-THP caused activation of caspase and resulted in apoptosis, L-THP may be a novel molecule for inducing apoptosis specifically in p53 null leukemia EU-4 cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['EU-4 cells', 'L-Tetrahydropalmatine', 'MDM2', 'XIAP', 'isoquinoline alkaloid', 'leukemia']",,"['0 (Berberine Alkaloids)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '3X69CO5I79 (tetrahydropalmatine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a particularly innovative approach, we developed a treatment with a Treg-protected donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for patients with early relapse after HSCT and we report here the results obtained in the first patient with APL (M3v) relapsed after a second matched allogeneic HSCT (15% blasts and 75% of donor cells in bone marrow). The patient received a first infusion of 2.5 x 10(6)/kg Tregs derived from matched donor followed 7 days later by 5 x 10(6)/kg Tcons. GvL effect was strongly evident as the percentage of leukemic cells decreased to 5%. A second infusion of Tregs (2.5 x 10(6)/kg) and Tcons (2 x 10(6)/kg) was performed. No GvHD was observed.

Epub 2017 Jul 18.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been proposed to dampen functions of anti-neoplastic immune cells and thus promote cancer progression. In a phase IV trial (Re:Mission Trial, NCT01347996, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) 84 patients (age 18-79) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR) received ten consecutive 3-week cycles of immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) to prevent relapse of leukemia in the post-consolidation phase. This study aimed at defining the features, function and dynamics of Foxp3(+)CD25(high)CD4(+) Tregs during immunotherapy and to determine the potential impact of Tregs on relapse risk and survival. We observed a pronounced increase in Treg counts in peripheral blood during initial cycles of HDC/IL-2. The accumulating Tregs resembled thymic-derived natural Tregs (nTregs), showed augmented expression of CTLA-4 and suppressed the cell cycle proliferation of conventional T cells ex vivo. Relapse of AML was not prognosticated by Treg counts at onset of treatment or after the first cycle of immunotherapy. However, the magnitude of Treg induction was diminished in subsequent treatment cycles. Exploratory analyses implied that a reduced expansion of Tregs in later treatment cycles and a short Treg telomere length were significantly associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Our results suggest that immunotherapy with HDC/IL-2 in AML entails induction of immunosuppressive Tregs that may be targeted for improved anti-leukemic efficiency.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'IL-2', 'Immunotherapy', 'Regulatory T cells']",,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",PMC5645432,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01347996'],,,,,,,

However, somatic mutational studies have focused on alterations in cancer cells, assuming that the microenvironment is genetically normal. Because we hypothesized that this might not be a valid assumption, we performed exome sequencing and targeted sequencing to investigate for the presence of pathogenic mutations in tumor-associated leukocytes in breast cancers. METHODS: We used targeted sequencing and exome sequencing to evaluate the presence of mutations in sorted tumor-infiltrating CD45-positive cells from primary untreated breast cancers. We used high-depth sequencing to determine the presence/absence of the mutations we identified in breast cancer-infiltrating leukocytes in purified tumor cells and in circulating blood cells. RESULTS: Capture-based sequencing of 15 paired tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and matched germline DNA identified variants in known cancer genes in all 15 primary breast cancer patients in our cohort. We validated the presence of mutations identified by targeted sequencing in infiltrating leukocytes through orthogonal exome sequencing. Ten patients harbored alterations previously reported as somatically acquired variants, including in known leukemia genes (DNTM3A, TET2, and BCOR). One of the mutations observed in the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes was also detected in the circulating leukocytes of the same patients at a lower allele frequency than observed in the tumor-infiltrating cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that somatic mutations, including mutations in known cancer genes, are present in the leukocytes infiltrating a subset of primary breast cancers. This observation allows for the possibility that the cancer cells interact with mutant infiltrating leukocytes, which has many potential clinical implications.",,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC5515194,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the synergistic effect of p53 upregulation and demethylation induced by 520d-5p, the current study investigated the effect of this miRNA on apoptotic induction by ultraviolet B (UVB) light in normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells. 520d-5p was lentivirally transfected into NHDF cells either before or after a lethal dose of UVB irradiation (302 nm) to assess its preventive or therapeutic effects, respectively. The methylation level, gene expression, production of type I collagen and cell cycle distribution were estimated in UV-irradiated cells. NHDF cells transfected with 520d-5p prior to UVB irradiation had apoptotic characteristics, and the transfection exerted no preventive effects. However, transfection with 520d-5p into NHDF cells after UVB exposure resulted in the induction of reprogramming in damaged fibroblasts, the survival of CD105-positive cells, an extended cell lifespan and prevention of cellular damage or malfunction; these outcomes were similar to the effects observed in 520d-5p-transfected NHDF cells (520d/NHDF). The gene expression of c-Abl (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein), and BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene I) in transfectants was transcriptionally upregulated in order. These mechanistic findings indicate that ATR-dependent DNA damage repair was activated under this stressor. In conclusion, 520d-5p exerted a therapeutic effect on cells damaged by UVB and restored them to a normal senescent state following functional restoration via survival of CD105-positive cells through c-Abl-ATR-BRCA1 pathway activation, p53 upregulation, and demethylation.",,,,,,PMC5515008,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is widely involved in the pathogenesis of tumors. miR-98 belongs to the let-7 family, and its overexpression can increase the sensitivity to drugs in solid cancer cells. However, the function of miR-98 in leukemia is still unclear. In this study, the effect of miR-98 on drug resistance and proliferation of leukemia cells were investigated. METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyzed the expression difference between miR-98 and E2F1 in leukemia cell lines, K562 and K562/A02. The downstream target gene of miR-98 was predicted by TargetScan; K562/A02 was transiently transfected with miR-98 mimic to upregulate the expression of miR-98; real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to analyze the expression alterations of E2F1; cell counting kit-8 was used to evaluate the influence on K562/A02 proliferation and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs; meanwhile, Western blot was used to analyze the expression of p21, Bax, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and ABCG2 proteins. RESULTS: E2F1 is one of the target genes of miR-98 proved by bioinformatics. Compared with the K562, the level of miRNA-98 expression was decreased in K562/A02, but the level of E2F1 expression was upregulated. Leukemia cell line K562/A02 was transfected with miR-98 mimic to upregulate the expression of miR-98, the expression of E2F1 was significantly decreased. After upregulating the miR-98 expression in K562/A02, the proliferation was weakened, and the sensitivity to chemotherapy was increased. Western blot showed that upregulated miR-98 expression increased the levels of p21 and BAX proteins in K562/A02 cells, and decreased the levels of matrix metalloprotease 9 and ABCG2 proteins, which were significantly different compared with those before miR-98 mimic transfection. CONCLUSION: In the leukemia drug-resistant cell line K562/A02, the targeted upregulated expression of miR-98 could decrease the proliferation of leukemia cells and improve the sensitivity to chemotherapeutics by inhibiting E2F1 expression. miR-98 might be a potential target for overcoming leukemia multidrug resistance.",,['NOTNLM'],"['E2F1', 'K562/A02', 'drug resistance', 'leukemia cells', 'miRNA-98']",,,PMC5499860,,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the economic importance of thyme oils, many thyme species have been studied, and their essential oils (EOs) and other volatile-containing extracts have been chemically characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities as well as the phytochemical composition of the EOs from fruits and flowers of T. capitata and Thymus species. High antioxidant capacity has been observed and related to the relative amounts of terpenoid and phenolic with good antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activities decreased as follows: TAC > TZ > TC > TM. The results of antimicrobial activity showed that all tested EOs were active against all tested microbial species, including Gram-positive and negative bacteria. The minimum inhibition concentration values obtained ranged from 0.1 to 0.01 muL/mL. Furthermore, all EOs assayed induced cell death in both human epitheloid cervix carcinoma and histiocytic leukemia cell lines. Overall, the results of this study indicates that the EOs from fruits and flowers of T. capitata and Thymus species posses interesting antioxidant properties and represent a potential source of medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antimicrobial', 'Antioxidant', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Essential oils', 'Thymbra', 'Thymus']",,,PMC5495709,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8549-9343'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 18.,"Purpose: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are frequently deregulated in leukemia, yet the biological consequences of this deregulation remain elusive. The mechanisms underlying aberrant methylation, a hallmark of leukemia, are not fully understood. Here we investigated the role of RTKs in methylation abnormalities and characterized the hypomethylating activities of RTK inhibitors.Experimental Design: Whether and how RTKs regulate expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) as well as global and gene-specific DNA methylation were examined. The pharmacologic activities and mechanisms of actions of RTK inhibitors in vitro, ex vivo, in mice, and in nilotinib-treated leukemia patients were determined.Results: Upregulation of RTKs paralleled DNMT overexpression in leukemia cell lines and patient blasts. Knockdown of RTKs disrupted, whereas enforced expression increased DNMT expression and DNA methylation. Treatment with the RTK inhibitor, nilotinib, resulted in a reduction of Sp1-dependent DNMT1 expression, the diminution of global DNA methylation, and the upregulation of the p15(INK4B) gene through promoter hypomethylation in AML cell lines and patient blasts. This led to disruption of AML cell clonogenicity and promotion of cellular apoptosis without obvious changes in cell cycle. Importantly, nilotinib administration in mice and human patients with AML impaired expression of DNMTs followed by DNA hypomethylation, TSG re-expression, and leukemia regression.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate RTKs as novel regulators of DNMT-dependent DNA methylation and define DNA methylation status in AML cells as a pharmacodynamic marker for their response to RTK-based therapy, providing new therapeutic avenues for RTK inhibitors in overcoming epigenetic abnormalities in leukemia.

Epub 2017 Jul 18.,"Cancer cells frequently possess extra amplified centrosomes clustered into two poles whose pseudo-bipolar spindles exhibit reduced fidelity of chromosome segregation and promote genetic instability. Inhibition of centrosome clustering triggers multipolar spindle formation and mitotic catastrophe, offering an attractive therapeutic approach to selectively kill cells with amplified centrosomes. However, mechanisms of centrosome clustering remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a new pathway that acts through NIMA-related kinase 6 (Nek6) and Hsp72 to promote centrosome clustering. Nek6, as well as its upstream activators polo-like kinase 1 and Aurora-A, targeted Hsp72 to the poles of cells with amplified centrosomes. Unlike some centrosome declustering agents, blocking Hsp72 or Nek6 function did not induce formation of acentrosomal poles, meaning that multipolar spindles were observable only in cells with amplified centrosomes. Inhibition of Hsp72 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells resulted in increased multipolar spindle frequency that correlated with centrosome amplification, while loss of Hsp72 or Nek6 function in noncancer-derived cells disturbs neither spindle formation nor mitotic progression. Hence, the Nek6-Hsp72 module represents a novel actionable pathway for selective targeting of cancer cells with amplified centrosomes. Cancer Res; 77(18); 4785-96.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a member of the secretin/growth hormone-releasing hormone/vasoactive intestinal peptide family and has many functions, including cytoprotection and immunosuppression. We tested the hypothesis that PACAP can protect against MXT-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Female BALB/c mice were treated once weekly for 4 weeks with saline (n=14) or MXT (3mg/kg, i.p.; n=14). Half of the mice in each group received PACAP (10mug, i.p.) 1h before and 24 and 48h after MXT, while the remaining mice received injections of saline on the same schedule. Echocardiography was used to assess cardiac structure and function. In mice treated with MXT and saline, body weight was significantly reduced after the third dose of MXT. PACAP significantly attenuated the reduction in body weight; however, the weights did not return to control level. Compared to controls, MXT-treated mice had significantly increased left ventricular (LV) diameter and LV volume and decreased LV posterior wall thickness. Fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) were also significantly decreased. Treatment with PACAP prevented MXT-induced LV dilation and significantly attenuated the reductions in FS and EF, although FS and EF did not return to control level. PACAP38 did not prevent MXT-induced decreases in LV posterior wall thickness. MXT dose-dependently decreased the viability of cultured U937 (human leukemia) cells; PACAP did not protect cultured U937 cells from MXT-mediated cell death. In conclusion, PACAP can attenuate MXT-mediated LV dilation and dysfunction in mice.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to explore ambient exposure to dichloromethane (methylene chloride).

Information on industrial releases of dichloromethane within 3km of birth addresses was retrieved from mandatory industry reports to the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). We derived exposure to dichloromethane within close vicinity of birth residences using several modeling techniques including unconditional logistic regression models with multiple buffer distances, inverse distance weighting, and quadratic decay models. RESULTS: We observed elevated risks for germ cell tumors [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.52, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.11, 2.08], particularly teratomas (OR: 2.08, 95% CI 1.38-3.13), and possible increased risk for acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (OR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.15-2.32 in the quadratic decay model).

Epub 2017 Aug 9.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an orphan disease that primarily affects the elderly. The majority of symptomatic patients eligible for frontline treatment are unfit for fludarabine based chemoimmunotherapy. Historical treatment includes chlorambucil (Chl), bendamustine/rituximab (BR), and chlorambucil/rituximab/ChlR combination. Clinical guidelines now recommend the use of novel agents, such as ibrutinib (Ibr), in both frontline and relapse settings and other novel agents, such as idelalisib (with rituximab), in relapse settings. Despite compelling clinical results for novel agents, follow-up in clinical trials is relatively short and, thus, the comparative long-term benefits are still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors developed a simulation model to generate treatment specific lifetime estimates of Overall Survival (OS) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for treatment with BR, Chl, ChlR, and Ibr. Two potential clinical scenarios were modelled: with and without novel agents for treating CLL. The model was based on health states relating to first- and second-line progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival, and death. RESULTS: Where novel agents were assumed unavailable, mean OS ranged from 5.4-8.5 years and QALYs from 3.5-6.1. Where novel agents were available, the mean OS increased to 10.0 years, with a corresponding increase in QALYs to 7.6. Frontline Ibr use followed by Physician's Choice, including novel agents at relapse, resulted in projected increase in OS of between 18% (1.5 years) and 85% (4.6 years), corresponding to a 25-117% increase in QALYs, compared with currently available traditional therapies. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this analysis include immature OS data and the assumption of equivalent efficacy across all novel agents in terms of their impact on PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: The use of novel agents is predicted to yield substantive gains in predicted lifetime OS and QALY improvements compared to traditional therapies in CLL patients who are ineligible for fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'QALY', 'elderly', 'novel agents', 'overall survival', 'progression free survival', 'treatment naive', 'unfit']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 18.,"OBJECTIVE: Humanin (HN) has been identified to suppress neuron death. Gly(14)-HN (HNG), as a variant of HN, can decrease infarct volume after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of HNG on global cerebral I/R (GI) in rats. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 13 groups: Sham group, GI groups and HNG groups. Both GI group and HNG groups included six time points (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h). At 24 h after reperfusion, Nissl staining was used to observe positive neurons, and p-STAT3, MCL-1, SOCS3, Bax and Caspase-3 in different groups were detected by immunohistochemistry. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to evaluate the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, MCL-1, and SOCS3. RESULTS: The immunohistochemistry also showed a significant increase in Bax (0.29 +/- 0.007 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.007, P < 0.01) and Caspase-3 (0.24 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.006, P < 0.01) in GI group compared with Sham group, while Bax (0.26 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.008, P < 0.01) and Caspase-3 (0.20 +/- 0.008 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.02, P < 0.01) were significantly decreased by HNG-treatment compared with GI group. Along with immunohistochemistry, western blot and qRT-PCR indicated that the protein and mRNA levels of STAT3, MCL-1, and SOCS3 were up-regulated after administration of HNG at six time points after global cerebral I/R in rat. CONCLUSION: HNG might exert neuroprotective effects through alleviating apoptosis and activating of SOCS3 - STAT3 - MCL-1 signal transduction pathway.

Epub 2017 Jul 19.,"The facts that cancer represents tissues consisting of heterogeneous neoplastic, as well as reactive, cell populations and that cancers of the same histotype may show profound differences in clinical behavior have long been recognized. With the advent of new technologies and the demands of precision medicine, the investigation of tumor heterogeneity has gained much interest. An understanding of intertumoral heterogeneity in patients with the same disease entity is necessary to optimally guide personalized treatment. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that different tumor areas or primary tumors and metastases in an individual patient can show significant intratumoral heterogeneity on different levels. This phenomenon can be driven by genomic instability, epigenetic events, the tumor microenvironment, and stochastic variations in cellular function and antitumoral therapies. These mechanisms may lead to branched subclonal evolution from a common progenitor clone, resulting in spatial variation between different tumor sites, disease progression, and treatment resistance. This review addresses tumor heterogeneity in lymphomas from a pathologist's viewpoint. The relationship between morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic heterogeneity is exemplified in different lymphoma entities and reviewed in the context of high-grade transformation and transdifferentiation. In addition, factors driving heterogeneity, as well as clinical and therapeutic implications of lymphoma heterogeneity, will be discussed.","['(c) 2017 S.

In this study, we focused on investigating whether HA could serve as a possible prognostic marker in patients with AML, B-ALL, and MCL. METHODS: The serum concentration of HA was measured in a total of 51 patients with newly diagnosed AML, B-ALL, and MCL. Venous blood was collected 1 day before the initiation of chemotherapy (D0), on day 16 of the first cycle of chemotherapy (D16), and on D30. RESULTS: The serum HA concentration on D0 in patients with AML, B-ALL, and MCL was higher than in the control group. For all types of hematological malignancy, on D0, serum HA values of nonsurvivors were higher than in survivors. Moreover, patients in relapse had higher levels of serum HA than patients in remission. A strong positive correlation between serum HA and ferritin, beta2-microglobulin, and lactate dehydrogenase was found. CONCLUSION: Serum HA may serve as a possible prognostic marker for AML, B-ALL, and MCL patients, especially on D0.

Hence, our study aims to investigate the relationship between MMP-2 -1306C>T and MMP-9 -1562C>T polymorphisms and the risk and prognosis of T-ALL. METHODS: From April 2009 to February 2011, a total of 376 T-ALL patients were chosen as the case group. Meanwhile, 352 healthy people who passed routine health examinations were selected as the control group. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was used to detect the frequency of MMP-2 -1306C>T (rs243865) and MMP-9 -1562C>T (rs3918242) polymorphisms in the study subjects. The serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed to analyze the event-free survival (EFS) rates of the T-All patients with different MMP-2 and MMP-9 genotypes. A multivariate COX model was applied to analyze the relationship between MMP-2 and MMP-9 polymorphisms and the prognosis of T-ALL patients. A C-statistic and net reclassification index (NRI) was carried out to evaluate the predictive value of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene polymorphisms using the Cox model. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the genotypic frequency of MMP-2 -1306C>T (CT + TT) and MMP-9 -1562C>T (CT + TT) in the case group was significantly higher. The serum level of MMP-9 was markedly elevated in T-ALL patients with the CT + TT genotype compared to patients with the CC genotype. The results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the median EFS was lower in T-ALL patients with the CT + TT genotype of MMP-9 -1562C>T compared to patients with the CC genotype. The results of a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model indicated that the MMP-9 -1562C>T polymorphism was associated with the prognosis of T-ALL patients. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that MMP-2 -1306C/T and MMP-9 -1562C/T polymorphisms might be associated with an increased risk of T-ALL. The MMP-9 -1562C>T polymorphism may also be related to the prognosis of T-ALL patients.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

However, despite this success, toxicities associated with CAR-T administration remain a significant concern. There continues to be substantial heterogeneity among CAR-T products, and differences in both CAR designs and CAR-T production strategies can substantially affect clinical outcomes. Ongoing clinical studies will further elucidate these differences and many other innovative approaches are being evaluated at the preclinical level.

Epub 2017 Jul 28.,"Flow cytometry has been traditionally used to diagnose leukaemia and lymphoma in peripheral blood, bone marrow, body fluids, and tissue samples. The diagnosis of a malignant epithelial tumour is usually made by correlation between histopathologic appearance and the use of immunohistochemical staining. A CE approved BerEP4 antibody (anti-EpCAM, CD326) is available for flow cytometric testing, but has been evaluated predominantly in body fluids in the current literature. In this study, we have evaluated the performance of this antibody in detecting the presence of epithelial cells in tissue samples which have traditionally been reported as CD45 negative cells by flow cytometry. Among the 42 cases studied, 21 (50%) were found to be positive for CD326, thereby suggesting epithelial differentiation. The results had good concordance rates (97.6%) with final histopathological diagnosis. The results clearly show that flow cytometric testing for BerEP4 (CD326) can be a useful method for diagnosing nonhaematological malignancies that are poorly differentiated. As this is a rapid method for identifying epithelial differentiation, it can help the histopathologists tailor and rationalise the immunohistochemical panel, with the potential benefits of improving reporting times and work-flow in the laboratory.

However, ~30-40% of patients develop resistance to imatinib therapy. Although most resistance is caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, 50-85% of these patients develop resistance in the absence of new mutations. In these cases, targeting other pathways may be needed to regain clinical response. Using label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, we evaluated a number of leukemia cell lines and discovered an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester (CE) in CML, which was found to be a result of BCR-ABL kinase activity. CE accumulation in CML was found to be a cancer-specific phenomenon as untransformed cells did not accumulate CE. Blocking cholesterol esterification with avasimibe, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1), significantly suppressed CML cell proliferation in Ba/F3 cells with the BCR-ABLT315I mutation and in K562 cells rendered imatinib resistant without mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (K562R cells). Furthermore, the combination of avasimibe and imatinib caused a profound synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation in K562R cells, but not in Ba/F3T315I. This synergistic effect was confirmed in a K562R xenograft mouse model. Analysis of primary cells from a BCR-ABL mutation-independent imatinib resistant patient by mass cytometry suggested that the synergy may be due to downregulation of the MAPK pathway by avasimibe, which sensitized the CML cells to imatinib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel strategy for overcoming BCR-ABL mutation-independent TKI resistance in CML.",,,,"['K08 HL106576/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Acetates)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '28LQ20T5RC (avasimibe)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC5515395,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5607-6683'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carriers of the -680AA genotype displayed a median percentage of 44.08 (interquartile range=34.69), compared with 77.98 (interquartile range=33.90) for CC and CA carriers (P=0.01). The number of counts within white blood cell therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0x10/L) was higher for -680AA carriers than for CC/CA carriers (P=0.003). With regard to toxicity, carriers of the -680AA genotype displayed more treatment interruptions than CC/CG carriers (P=0.03), as well as more episodes of severe neutropenia (P=0.04) and higher number of blood counts with elevated levels (>400 mg/dL) of lactate dehidrogenase (P=0.04). Overall, our findings suggest that the identification of DHFR polymorphisms in the promoter region of the gene may be helpful in tailoring MTX doses for ALL pediatric patients on maintenance therapy.",,,,,"['EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, inheritance patterns are not always easy to identify because sporadic cases from de novo mutations may in fact be more common. Few studies have assessed the relationship between thrombocytopenia and malignancies, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we present a pediatric case of persistent thrombocytopenia associated with T-cell ALL.

Epub 2017 Aug 8.,"Cancer is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) are naturally occurring compounds and their alkyl esters may possess enhanced biological activities. We evaluated C4, C14, C16, and C18 alkyl esters of p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, and caffeic acids (19 compounds) for their cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cells and also examined their effect on cell cycle alteration and apoptosis induction. The tetradecyl (1c) and hexadecyl (1d) esters of p-coumaric acid and tetradecyl ester of caffeic acid (4c), but not the parental HCAs, were selectively effective against MOLT-4 (human lymphoblastic leukemia) cells with IC50 values of 0.123 +/- 0.012, 0.301 +/- 0.069 and 1.0 +/- 0.1 muM, respectively. Compounds 1c, 1d, and 4c significantly increased apoptotic cells in sub-G1 phase and activated the caspase-3 enzyme in MOLT-4 cells. Compound 1c was 15.4 and 23.6 times more potent than doxorubicin and cisplatin, respectively, against the drug resistant MES-SA-DX5 uterine sarcoma cells. These p-coumarate esters were several times less effective against NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells. Docking studies showed that 1c may cause cytotoxicity by interaction with carbonic anhydrase IX. In conclusion, long chain alkyl esters of p-coumaric acid are promising scaffolds for selective apoptosis induction in cancer cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer cell', 'apoptosis', 'caspase-3', 'cytotoxic activity', 'hydroxycinnamic acids']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Esters)']",,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2563-6342', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5495-5126', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1050-2402']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, those tissues which multiply rapidly are at high risk of developing cancer and haematopoietic system is one of them. Neoplasms of this system are known as leukaemia and lymphoma, according to the types of white cells involved. Study of cancer patterns in different societies, however can contribute a substantial knowledge about the aetiology of cancer. The present Study was designed and aimed to estimate the frequency of different types of leukaemia in patients admitted in Ayub Teaching hospital Abbottabad. METHODS: Data from the patients admitted at oncology Department of Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad from 2010 to 2015 was collected and analysed to calculate cumulative and year-wise frequency of leukaemia and its major types. Frequency distribution with reference to gender and age was also calculated. RESULTS: In our analysis about 16% patients had acute myelocytic leukaemia and 32% patients had acute lymphocytic leukaemia; while chronic myeloid leukaemia outnumbered chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11% and 3%); Hodgkin lymphoma was seen in 18% cases while Non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was present in 20% cases. Out of the total, 150 cases (75%) belonged to mountainous areas of Hazara, i.e., 40 cases belonged to Kohistan, another 40 cases were residents of Battagram, 45 cases belonged to hilly areas of Mansehra and 25 cases to Kaghan valley, while only 50 (25%) cases were from the plain areas of Abbottabad and Haripur districts, i.e., 20 and 30 cases respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Leukaemia is more common in hilly areas of Hazara, since majority of the cases belonged to well-known mountainous regions of Kohistan, Battagram, Kaghan or Mansehra and only few cases belonged to the plain areas of Abbottabad and Haripur districts.",,['NOTNLM'],"['leukaemia', 'lymphoid leukaemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloid leukaemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These three disorders share several clinical and laboratory features including JAK2 V617F mutation. Our objectives were to determine the clinico-pathological profile and outcomes of Pakistani patients with polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) in order to have an insight regarding behaviour of these conditions. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all the cases of PV, ET and IMF diagnosed at our institute from January 1995 to December 2013 was performed. Age, gender, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, treatment provided and duration of follow-up were included for analysis. Appropriate statistics were utilized for calculation of data. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were diagnosed as PV, ET or IMF during the study period. Male to female ratio was 1.1:1. Forty five percent (n=27) patients came to medical attention due to abnormal laboratory results, 3 had cerebrovascular events, 3 had pruritus, and 1 patient each with gangrene and Budd-Chiari syndrome. Haemorrhage was not seen in any patient. Sixty percent (n=35) patients were treated with phlebotomy, hydroxyurea and aspirin alone or in combination. None of the patients transformed to myelofibrosis (MF) or myelodysplasia (MDS) during the mean (+/-SD) follow-up period of 57.2+/-50 months. One patient with ET transformed to acute myeloid leukaemia 9 years after the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a relatively more benign form of PV, ET and IMF with lesser frequency of symptoms, good response to treatment and less likelihood of transformation to MF, MDS or AML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Essential thrombocythaemia', 'Idiopathic myelofibrosis', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Pakistan', 'Polycythaemia vera']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-renewal and lack of differentiation are also features of stem cells and have been associated with the expression of embryonic genes. The aim of our study was to evaluate the expression of embryonic antigens (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA1, SSEA3) in hematopoietic stem cell subsets (CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(+)) from normal bone marrows and in samples from acute myeloid leukemia patients. We observed an upregulation of the transcription factors OCT4 and SOX2 in leukemic cells as compared to normal cells. Conversely, SSEA1 protein was downregulated in leukemic cells. The expression of OCT4, SOX2, and SSEA3 was higher in CD34(+)CD38(-) than in CD34(+)CD38(+) subsets in leukemic cells. There was no correlation with biological characteristics of the leukemia. We evaluated the prognostic value of marker expression in 69 patients who received an intensive treatment. The rate of complete remission was not influenced by the level of expression of markers. Overall survival was significantly better for patients with high SOX2 levels, which was unexpected because of the inverse correlation with favorable genetic subtypes. These results prompt us to evaluate the potential role of these markers in leukemogenesis and to test their relevance for better leukemic stem cell identification.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'aberrant expression', 'embryonic antigens', 'hematopoietic cells', 'leukemic cells']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (FUT4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cases, immunophenotyping is often employed using flow cytometry, and/or immunohistochemistry. However, due the overlap in T-cell phenotype between thymic neoplasm/hyperplasia (THY), T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), and reactive lymph nodes (RLN), biopsies consisting predominantly of T-cells may still be difficult to differentiate. Previous studies have shown a specific CD3/bcl-2 staining pattern in thymic T cells of humans and mice using flow cytometry. However, the utility of this finding in distinguishing T-cells of THY, T-LBL, and RLN has not been carefully evaluated. Our findings show that the pattern of CD3/bcl-2 expression in thymic T-cells can be used to help diagnose anterior mediastinal biopsies, even when limited specimen is provided.

Epub 2017 Aug 11.,"BACKGROUND: The transmembrane receptor C-type lectin domain family 12, member A (CLEC12A) is known to be highly expressed on monocytes and neutrophils and is a reliable leukemia associated marker in acute myeloid leukemia. Consequently, detailed knowledge of the various normal cell types expressing this receptor is essential. We have observed CLEC12A to be expressed on CD45lowSSClowCD14-CD123+ basophils in peripheral blood (PB) and in this study, we aimed at verifying this observation and further delineate the CD45lowSSClowCD14-CD123 + CLEC12A+ subpopulation. METHODS: We analyzed PB from 20 diagnostic chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) samples and eight healthy donors in a six-color multicolor flowcytometry (FCM) based assay. Furthermore, we performed fluorescence activated cell sorting on one CML sample to morphologically confirm the CD45lowSSClowCD14-CD123 + CLEC12A+ subset to be highly enriched for basophils. Finally, to further delineate the CD45lowSSClowCD14-CD123 + CLEC12A+ subpopulation in normal PB, we examined three healthy donors in a 10-color FCM assay enabling further separation of the cell subset into basophils and dendritic cells. RESULTS: The CLEC12A receptor is expressed on basophils. CONCLUSIONS: Identification and enumeration of basophils is of high relevance in diagnostic hematology and immunology. We here show that CLEC12A in a simple FCM assay consistently marks basophils. Importantly, as basophils are characterized by a CD45lowSSClow profile similar to the ""blast-gate"" used for the evaluation of hematological disorders, awareness of minor normal CLEC12A+ subpopulations is crucial when using CLEC12A as a minimal residual disease marker in myeloid malignancies.

METHODS: Cancer cases from nine Spanish population-based cancer registries were included and analysed as a whole. All primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed in adult patients were eligible for the analysis. Cancer patients were followed until 31 December 2008. For each type of cancer, 1-, 3- and 5-year observed and relative survival were estimated by sex, age and years from diagnosis. Furthermore, age-standardized 5-year relative survival for the period 2000-2007 has been compared with that of the period 1995-1999. RESULTS: Skin melanoma (84.6 95% CI 83.0-86.2), prostate (84.6% 95% CI 83.6-85.6) and thyroid (84.2% CI 95% 82.0-86.6) cancers showed the highest 5-year relative survival, whereas the worst prognosis was observed in pancreatic (6% 95% CI 5.1-7.0) and oesophageal (9.4% 95% CI 7.9-11.1) cancers. Overall, survival is higher in women (58.0%) than in men (48.9%). The absolute difference in relative survival between 2000-2007 and 1995-1999 was positive for all cancers as a whole (+4.8% in men, +1.6% in women) and for most types of tumours. Survival increased significantly for chronic myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rectum cancer in both sexes, and for acute lymphoid leukaemia, prostate, liver and colon cancers in men and Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer in women. Survival patterns by age were similar in Europe and Spain. A decline in survival by age was observed in all tumours, being more pronounced for ovarian, corpus uteri, prostate and urinary bladder and less for head and neck and rectum cancers. CONCLUSION: High variability and differences have been observed in survival among adults in Spain according to the type of cancer diagnosed, from above 84% to below 10%, reflecting high heterogeneity. The differences in prognosis by age, sex and period of diagnosis reveal opportunities for improving cancer care in Spain.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cancer registries', 'Population-based', 'Prognosis', 'Spain', 'Survival']",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9242-3040'],['REDECAN Working Group'],,,,,,,,,"['Mateos A', 'Almar E', 'Quiros JR', 'Arguelles MV', 'Menendez V', 'Rojas D', 'Aleman A', 'Torrella A', 'Sabater C', 'Botella P', 'Chico M', 'Ripoll M', 'Diaz C', 'Vicente M', 'Fuster N', 'Botella P', 'Diaz JM', 'Jimenez R', 'Navarro AIM', 'Larranaga N', 'Bidaurrazaga J', 'Lopez-de-Munain A', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Izquierdo A', 'Vilardell L', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Molina-Portillo E', 'Rodriguez-Barranco M', 'Perucha J', 'Franch P', 'Ramos M', 'Navarro C', 'Chirlaque MD', 'Salmeron D', 'Ardanaz E', 'Guevara M', 'Burgui R', 'Galceran J', 'Ameijide A', 'Carulla M', 'Bigorra J', 'Bonet RP', 'Pardo E']","['Mateos, Antonio', 'Almar, Enrique', 'Quiros, Jose Ramon', 'Arguelles, Marcial V', 'Menendez, Virginia', 'Rojas, Dolores', 'Aleman, Araceli', 'Torrella, Ana', 'Sabater, Consol', 'Botella, Paloma', 'Chico, Matilde', 'Ripoll, Maria', 'Diaz, Cristina', 'Vicente, Marisa', 'Fuster, Nieves', 'Botella, Paloma', 'Diaz, Jose Maria', 'Jimenez, Rosario', 'Navarro, Ana Isabel Marcos', 'Larranaga, Nerea', 'Bidaurrazaga, Joseba', 'Lopez-de-Munain, Arantza', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Izquierdo, Angel', 'Vilardell, Loreto', 'Sanchez, Maria Jose', 'Molina-Portillo, Elena', 'Rodriguez-Barranco, Miguel', 'Perucha, Josefina', 'Franch, Paula', 'Ramos, Maria', 'Navarro, Carmen', 'Chirlaque, Maria Dolores', 'Salmeron, Diego', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'Guevara, Marcela', 'Burgui, Rosana', 'Galceran, Jaume', 'Ameijide, Alberto', 'Carulla, Maria', 'Bigorra, Jamnica', 'Bonet, Rafael Peris', 'Pardo, Elena']",,,,,

In this study, four strains of the subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J), named GX14HG01, GX14HG04, GX14LT07, and GX14ZS14, were isolated from chickens with clinical hemangioma in 2014 by DF-1 cell culture and then identified with ELISA detection of ALV group specific antigen p27, the detection of subtype specific PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with ALV-J specific monoclonal antibody. The complete genomes of the isolates were sequenced and it was found that the gag and pol were relatively conservative, while env was variable especially the gp85 gene. Homology analysis of the env gene sequences showed that the env gene of all the four isolates had higher similarities with the hemangioma (HE)-type reference strains than that of the myeloid leukosis (ML)-type strains, and moreover, the HE-type strains' specific deletion of 205-bp sequence covering the rTM and DR1 in 3'UTR fragment was also found in the four isolates. Further analysis on the sequences of subunits of env gene revealed an interesting finding: the gp85 of isolates GX14ZS14 and GX14HG04 had a higher similarity with HPRS-103 and much lower similarity with the HE-type reference strains resulting in GX14ZS14, GX14HG04, and HPRS-103 being clustered in the same branch, while gp37 had higher similarities with the HE-type reference strains when compared to that of HPRS-103, resulted in GX14ZS14, GX14HG04, and HE-type reference strains being clustered in the same branch.

We used life table analysis to calculate the risk of a second primary cancer and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by using age-specific cancer risk in the general population of Israeli women as the standard and stratifying by diagnosis period (1992 to 1996, 1997 to 2001, 2002 to 2006) and age at diagnosis (< 50 and >/= 50 years). RESULTS: The probability of a second malignancy was 3.6% within 5 years, 8.2% within 10 years, and 13.9% within 15 years. The SIR for any second non-breast primary cancer was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.23 to 1.30). Significantly increased risks of colorectal, uterine, lung, ovarian, and thyroid cancer and leukemia were observed for the full follow-up period, which persisted after excluding the first 6 months after index diagnosis, although increased leukemia and colorectal cancer risks were no longer statistically significant. Women younger than age 50 years at initial diagnosis had a greater excess risk than women age 50 years and older (SIR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.63 to 1.91] and 1.20 [95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24], respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings likely reflect a combination of personal risk factors (genetics, hormonal therapy, environmental exposures) as well as the effects of the initial cancer treatment and are unlikely to be explained by enhanced surveillance alone.",,,,,,PMC5493275,,,,,,"['The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this', 'manuscript.

In India, imatinib has been available for more than a decade and has been made accessible to all segments of the population because of patient assistance programs and cheaper generic versions. Despite improvements in survival, there are unique challenges in the Indian context. METHODS: We reviewed published data pertaining to CML in India for the period of 1990 to 2016, using PubMed advanced search with the terms chronic myeloid leukemia and India, and included studies that reported on epidemiology, monitoring for therapy, treatment outcomes, and resistance. Additionally, the references in retrieved articles were also reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were identified. The incidence of CML may be slightly lower in India than in the West, but there was only a single article reporting population-based data. Indian patients presented with more advanced disease. Most centers have access to imatinib as first-line therapy, but there is limited availability of molecular monitoring and second-line therapy. Most of the outcome data were retrospective but seemed comparable with that reported in Western centers. Drug adherence was impaired in at least one third of patients and contributed to poor survival. CONCLUSION: Focused prospective studies and cooperative studies might improve the quality of data available. Future studies should focus on adherence, its effects on outcomes, and methods to address this problem.",,,,,,PMC5493229,,,,,,"[""Authors' disclosures of potential conflicts of interest and contributions are"", 'found at the end of this article.The following represents disclosure information', 'provided by authors of this manuscript.

Although management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been described in low- and middle-income countries, few programs involve patients treated in rural settings. We describe characteristics and early outcomes of patients treated for CML at rural district hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with confirmed BCR-ABL-positive CML who were enrolled between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2014. Types of data included patient demographics, diagnostic work up, treatment, clinical examination, laboratory testing, and death. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included, with a maximum follow-up of 58 months. Of 31 patients who were imatinib-naive at enrollment, 54.8% were men and the median age at diagnosis was 36.9 years (interquartile range: 29-42 years). Approximately two-thirds of patients (67.7%) were on the national public insurance scheme. The imatinib dose was reduced for 16 patients and discontinued for five. Thirty-two of the 43 patients continued to have normal blood counts at last follow-up. Four patients have died and four are lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicates that CML can be effectively managed in a resource-constrained rural setting, despite limited availability of on-site diagnostic resources or specialty oncology personnel. The importance of model public-private partnerships as a strategy to bring high-cost, life-saving treatment to people who do not have the ability to pay is also highlighted.",,,,,,PMC5495451,,,,,,"[""Authors' disclosures of potential conflicts of interest and author contributions"", 'are found at the end of this article.The following represents disclosure', 'information provided by authors of this manuscript.

FTY720 differentially suppressed the viability of the OSCC cell lines SCC4, SCC25, and SCC2095 with IC50 values of 6.1, 6.3, and 4.5 muM, respectively. This antiproliferative effect was attributable to the ability of FTY720 to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistic evidence suggests that FTY720-induced apoptosis was associated with its ability to inhibit Akt-NF-kappaB signaling, to facilitate the proteasomal degradation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, and to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Both overexpression of Mcl-1 and inhibition of ROS partially protected cells from FTY720-induced caspase-9 activation, PARP cleavage and cytotoxicity. In addition, FTY720 induced autophagy in OSCC cells, as manifested by LC3B-II conversion, decreased p62 expression, and accumulation of autophagosomes. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 protected cells from FTY720-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings suggest an intricate interplay between autophagy and apoptosis in mediating the tumor-suppressive effect in OSCC cells, which underlies the translational potential of FTY720 in fostering new therapeutic strategies for OSCC.",,,,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)']",PMC5514089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 19;10(1):3322.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"Until recently, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was the only curative option for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). The first attempts at gene therapy for WAS using a Upsilon-retroviral vector improved immunological parameters substantially but were complicated by acute leukemia as a result of insertional mutagenesis in a high proportion of patients. More recently, treatment of children with a state-of-the-art self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV-w1.6 WASp) has resulted in significant clinical benefit without inducing selection of clones harboring integrations near oncogenes. Here, we describe a case of a presplenectomized 30-year-old patient with severe WAS manifesting as cutaneous vasculitis, inflammatory arthropathy, intermittent polyclonal lymphoproliferation, and significant chronic kidney disease and requiring long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Following reduced-intensity conditioning, there was rapid engraftment and expansion of a polyclonal pool of transgene-positive functional T cells and sustained gene marking in myeloid and B-cell lineages up to 20 months of observation. The patient was able to discontinue immunosuppression and exogenous immunoglobulin support, with improvement in vasculitic disease and proinflammatory markers. Autologous gene therapy using a lentiviral vector is a viable strategy for adult WAS patients with severe chronic disease complications and for whom an allogeneic procedure could present an unacceptable risk.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"PI3K/AKT and NOTCH1 signaling pathways are frequently dysregulated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). Although we have shown that the combined activities of the class I PI3K isoforms p110gamma and p110delta play a major role in the development and progression of PTEN-null T-ALL, it has yet to be determined whether their contribution to leukemogenic programing is unique from that associated with NOTCH1 activation. Using an Lmo2-driven mouse model of T-ALL in which both the PI3K/AKT and NOTCH1 pathways are aberrantly upregulated, we now demonstrate that the combined activities of PI3Kgamma/delta have both overlapping and distinct roles from NOTCH1 in generating T-ALL disease signature and in promoting tumor cell growth. Treatment of diseased animals with either a dual PI3Kgamma/delta or a gamma-secretase inhibitor reduced tumor burden, prolonged survival, and induced proapoptotic pathways. Consistent with their similar biological effects, both inhibitors downregulated genes involved in cMYC-dependent metabolism in gene set enrichment analyses. Furthermore, overexpression of cMYC in mice or T-ALL cell lines conferred resistance to both inhibitors, suggesting a point of pathway convergence. Of note, interrogation of transcriptional regulators and analysis of mitochondrial function showed that PI3Kgamma/delta activity played a greater role in supporting the disease signature and critical bioenergetic pathways. Results provide insight into the interrelationship between T-ALL oncogenic networks and the therapeutic efficacy of dual PI3Kgamma/delta inhibition in the context of NOTCH1 and cMYC signaling.

METHODS: Lymphoma cases diagnosed between 1984 and 2013 were classified according to the 2008 WHO classification system for lymphoid neoplasms. Death data (1984-2014) were obtained from the Manitoba Vital Statistics Agency. To examine time trends in incidence and mortality, we used joinpoint regression to estimate annual percentage change and average annual percentage change. Age-period-cohort modelling was conducted to measure the effects of age, period and cohort on incidence and mortality time trends. We estimated age-specific and standardised 5-year relative survival and used Poisson regression model to test time trends in relative survival. RESULTS: Total Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence in men and women was stable during the study period. Age-standardised total non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) incidence increased by 4% annually until around 2000, and the trend varied by sex and NHL subtype. Total HL mortality continuously declined (by 2.5% annually in men and by 2.7% annually in women), while total NHL mortality increased (by 4.4% annually in men until 1998 and by 3.2% annually in women until 2001) and then declined (by 3.6% annually in men and by 2.5% annually in women). Age-standardised 5-year relative survival for HL improved from 72.6% in 1984-1993 to 85.8% in 2004-2013, and for NHL from 57.0% in 1984-1993 to 67.5% in 2004-2013. Survival improvement was also noted for NHL subtypes, although the extent varied, with the greatest improvement for follicular lymphoma (from 65.3% in 1984-1993 to 87.6% in 2004-2013). CONCLUSIONS: Time trends were generally consistent with those reported in other jurisdictions in total HL and NHL incidence, but were unique in incidence for HL and for NHL subtypes chronic/small lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Survival improvements and mortality reductions were seen for HL and NHL in both sexes.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

Epub 2017 Jul 14.,"Cellular growth inhibition exerted by thiosemicarbazones is mainly attributed to down-regulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity, with RNR being responsible for the rate-limiting step of de novo DNA synthesis. In this study, we investigated the antineoplastic effects of three newly synthesized thiosemicarbazone derivatives, thiazolyl hydrazones, in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. The cytotoxicity of compounds alone and in combination with arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) was determined by growth inhibition assays. Effects on deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentrations were quantified by HPLC, and the incorporation of radio-labeled (14)C-cytidine into nascent DNA was measured using a beta counter. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by FACS, and protein levels of RNR subunits and checkpoint kinases were evaluated by Western blotting. VG12, VG19, and VG22 dose-dependently decreased intracellular dNTP concentrations, impaired cell cycle progression and, consequently, inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells. VG19 also lowered the protein levels of RNR subunits R1 and R2 and significantly diminished the incorporation of radio-labeled (14)C-cytidine, being equivalent to an inhibition of DNA synthesis. Combination of thiazolyl hydrazones with AraC synergistically potentiated the antiproliferative effects seen with each drug alone and might therefore improve conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of human malignancies such as acute promyelocytic or chronic myelogenous leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the relationship of the responses with the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and the levels of viral gene expression remain unclear. FINDINGS: We measured plasma levels of autoantibodies to NY-ESO-1 immunogenic tumor antigen in HTLV-1-infected individuals with different clinical status, and in healthy controls. Data were compared to tax and HBZ mRNA levels, and PVL. Plasma anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody was detectable in 13.7% (7/51) of ACs, 29.2% (38/130) of patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and 18.9% (10/53) of patients with ATL. Anti-NY-ESO-1 plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with HAM/TSP than in patients with ATL or ACs. Anti-NY-ESO-1 levels were not associated with PVL or the expression levels of tax and HBZ mRNA among HTLV-1-infected individuals, regardless of clinical status. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate the strong humoral immune response against NY-ESO-1 in natural HTLV-1 infection, irrespective of the clinical status. The higher immunoreactivity against NY-ESO-1 is not simply associated with the levels of both HTLV-1 gene expression and the number of infected cells in vivo. Rather, it might reflect chronic and generalized immune activation in infected individuals.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*ELISA', '*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*Monoclonal antibody', '*NY-ESO-1']",,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (CTAG1B protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",PMC5512893,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8208-5586'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reduced after the introduction of antibiotics with anti-pseudomonal effects, P. aeruginosa bacteremia still causes high mortality in immunocompromised patients. This study determined the clinical characteristics and outcomes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia and the antibiotic susceptibilities of strains isolated from febrile neutropenic patients. METHODS: Thirty-one febrile neutropenic children and adolescents with underlying hematologic/oncologic disorders diagnosed with P. aeruginosa bacteremia between 2011 and 2016 were enrolled in the study. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the demographic and clinical characteristics. Antibiotic susceptibility rates of the isolated P. aeruginosa to eight antibiotic categories (anti-pseudomonal penicillin, anti-pseudomonal penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin, monobactam, carbapenem, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, and colistin) were also determined. Among the investigated factors, risk factors for mortality and infections by a multidrug-resistance (MDR) strain were determined. RESULTS: Thirty-six episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia were identified. The mean age of the enrolled patients was 9.5 +/- 5.4 years, and 26 (72.2%) episodes occurred in boys. Acute myeloid leukemia (41.7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (33.3%) were the most common underlying disorders. The 30-day mortality was 38.9%, and 36.1% of the episodes were caused by MDR strains. The deceased patients were more likely to experience breakthrough infection (P = 0.036) and bacteremia (P = 0.005) due to MDR strains when compared with the patients who survived. The survived patients more likely received appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy (P = 0.024) and anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combination therapy (P = 0.039) compared with the deceased patients. The antibiotic susceptibility rates of the isolated P. aeruginosa strains were as follows: piperacillin/tazobactam, 67.6%; meropenem, 72.2%; and amikacin, 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality due to P. aeruginosa bacteremia remained at 38.9% in this study, and more than one-third of the isolated strains were MDR. In this context, empirical antibiotic combination therapy to expand the antibiotic spectrum may be a strategy to reduce mortality due to P. aeruginosa bacteremia in febrile neutropenic patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibiotic resistance', '*Child', '*Multidrug resistance', '*Neutropenia', '*Pseudomonas aeruginosa']",,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '0 (Thienamycins)', '157044-21-8 (Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",PMC5513208,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1299-2137'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to examine the apoptosis mechanisms induced by BM in a murine monomyelocytic cell line (WEHI-3) in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: A WEHI-3 cell line was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of BM by MTT. AO/PI and Hoechst 33342 dyes, Annexin V, multiparametric cytotoxicity 3 by high content screening (HCS); cell cycle tests were used to estimate the features of apoptosis and BM effects. Caspase 3 and 9 activities, ROS, western blot for Bcl2, and Bax were detected to study the mechanism of apoptosis. BALB/c mice injected with WEHI-3 cells were used to assess the apoptotic effect of BM in vivo. RESULTS: BM suppressed the growth of WEHI-3 cells at an IC50value of 14 +/- 3 mug/mL in 24 h. The ROS production was increased inside the cells in the treated doses. Both caspases (9 and 3) were activated in treating WEHI-3 cells at 24, 48 and 72 h. Different signs of apoptosis were detected, such as cell membrane blebbing, DNA segmentation and changes in the asymmetry of the cell membrane. Another action by which BM could inhibit WEHI-3 cells is to restrain the cell cycle at the G1/G0 phase.

Epub 2017 Aug 11.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the prognostic value of anemia for the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) receiving imatinib. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-four CML-CP patients were enrolled. The influences of moderate anemia with hemoglobin (Hb) < 10 g/dl, four scoring systems, and the early molecular response at 3 months (BCR-ABL </=10%; 3M-EMR) on the achievement of a deep molecular response (DMR, MR4.5), progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: Moderate anemia was identified in 44 (28.6%) patients. These patients had more aggressive baseline features and higher risks, as assessed by scoring systems, and less favorable treatment responses vs those without anemia, including 3M-EMR (50.0% vs 69.1%), a complete cytogenetic response at 6 months (20.5% vs 50.9%), and a major molecular response at 12 months (22.5% vs 45.2%), with a median follow-up of 54.0 months. Furthermore, an Hb of 10 g/dl better distinguished DMR, EFS, PFS, and OS than the EUTOS, Sokal, and Hasford scores, and better predicted the responses and survivals in combination with 3M-EMR than 3M-EMR alone. CONCLUSIONS: This finding highlights the significance of anemia in CML-CP, and suggests that patients with anemia at diagnosis should be carefully monitored and might benefit from more potent TKIs if not achieving 3M-EMR.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*anemia', '*prognosis', '*scoring systems']",,"['0 (Benzamides)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2336-4731'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 13.,"One of the important aims of drug discovery for cancer is to find therapeutic agents from natural products that are effective and safe for cancer treatment. In the current study, an alkaloid, 2-acetyl-benzylamine, isolated from Adhatoda vasica, was screened for potent anticancer properties against leukemia cells. We used seven different types of leukemia cells such as CEM, NB-4, MOLM-14, Jurkat, IM-9, K562 and HL-60 for cytotoxic studies. 2-acetyl-benzylamine showed significant cytotoxic properties against MOLM-14 and NB-4 cells with IC50 values of 0.40 and 0.39mM at 24h when compared to other tested cells, respectively. Apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V-FITC/PI kit using flow cytometry and confocal microscope in MOLM-14 and NB-4 cells. In addition, 2-acetyl-benzylamine induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in MOLM-14 cells and G0/G1 phase in NB-4 cells. Apoptosis mechanism was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Treatment with 2-acetyl-benzylamine decreased the Bcl-2 activity and increased the Bax expression; cytochrome c was released and caspases-3 was activated in MOLM-14 and NB-4 cells. Besides, 2-acetyl-benzylamine inhibited the expression of JAK2/STAT3 in MOLM-14 and NB-4 cells. In vivo administration of 2-acetyl-benzylamine inhibited the growth of MOLM-14 cells in xenograft mice model. Molecular docking study has been performed to investigate the binding mode and to estimate the binding energy of 2-acetyl-benzylamine with the active site of JAK-2, AKT1, FLT3 and Bcl-2. The above findings proved that 2-acetyl-benzylamine could be developed as a potential therapeutic agent against cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that supports the stability of client proteins. The proteasome is one of the targets for cancer therapy, and studies are underway to use proteasome inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we found that HSP90 was cleaved to a 55kDa protein after treatment with proteasome inhibitors including MG132 in leukemia cells but was not cleaved in other tissue-derived cells. HSP90 has two major isoforms (HSP90alpha and HSP90beta), and both were cleaved by MG132 treatment. MG132 treatment also induced a decrease in HSP90 client proteins. MG132 treatment generated ROS, and the cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). MG132 activated several caspases, and the activation was reduced by pretreatment with NAC. Based on an inhibitor study, the cleavage of HSP90 induced by MG132 was dependent on caspase 10 activation. Furthermore, active recombinant caspase 10 induced HSP90 cleavage in vitro. MG132 upregulated VDUP-1 expression and reduced the GSH levels implying that the regulation of redox-related proteins is involved. Taken all together, our results suggest that the cleavage of HSP90 by MG132 treatment is mediated by ROS generation and caspase 10 activation. HSP90 cleavage may provide an additional mechanism involved in the anti-cancer effects of proteasome inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Cancer cases (N=5,856) were selected from all children born from 1968 to 2014 and diagnosed from 1968 to 2015 in Denmark at less than 16 years of age listed in the nationwide Danish Cancer Registry. Cases were individually matched to controls (1:100) on sex and year of birth with a total of 585,594 controls randomly sampled from all live births in Denmark from the Danish Central Population Registry. Parental age at child's birth was extracted from the Central Population Registry. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios for the association between parental age at child's birth and childhood cancer risk. Parental age was modeled as both categorical (referent group, parents aged 25-29) and continuous per 5-year increase in age. RESULTS: Offspring of older mothers were at an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia [OR=1.10, 95% CI: (1.02, 1.19) per 5-year increase in age]. Older maternal age (40+) increased the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma [OR=1.96, 95%CI: (1.12, 3.43)]. The risk of Wilms' tumor also appeared elevated with older paternal age [OR=1.11, 95% CI: (0.97, 1.28) per 5-year increment in age].

We previously showed that these T-ALL mutations disrupt late cytoplasmic maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, blocking the release of the trans-acting factors Nmd3 and Tif6 in S. cerevisiae. Consequently, these mutant ribosomes do not efficiently pass the cytoplasmic quality control checkpoint and are blocked from engaging in translation. Here, we characterize suppressing mutations of the T-ALL-related rpl10-R98S mutant that bypass this block and show that the molecular defect of rpl10-R98S is a failure to release Nmd3 from the P site. Suppressing mutations were identified in Nmd3 and Tif6 that disrupted interactions between Nmd3 and the ribosome, or between Nmd3 and Tif6. Using an in vitro system with purified components, we found that Nmd3 inhibited Sdo1-stimulated Efl1 activity on mutant rpl10-R98S but not wild-type 60S subunits. Importantly, this inhibition was overcome in vitro by mutations in Nmd3 that suppressed rpl10-R98S in vivo. These results strongly support a model that Nmd3 must be dislodged from the P site to allow Sdo1 activation of Efl1, and define a failure in the removal of Nmd3 as the molecular defect of the T-ALL-associated rpl10-R98S mutation.",,,,['R01 GM053655/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (NMD3 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RPL10 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (TIF6 protein, S cerevisiae)']",PMC5536393,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4742-085X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"Purpose We evaluated the safety and feasibility of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had previously received ibrutinib. Methods Twenty-four patients with CLL received lymphodepleting chemotherapy and anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at one of three dose levels (2 x 10(5), 2 x 10(6), or 2 x 10(7) CAR-T cells/kg). Nineteen patients experienced disease progression while receiving ibrutinib, three were ibrutinib intolerant, and two did not experience progression while receiving ibrutinib. Six patients were venetoclax refractory, and 23 had a complex karyotype and/or 17p deletion. Results Four weeks after CAR-T cell infusion, the overall response rate (complete response [CR] and/or partial response [PR]) by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria was 71% (17 of 24). Twenty patients (83%) developed cytokine release syndrome, and eight (33%) developed neurotoxicity, which was reversible in all but one patient with a fatal outcome. Twenty of 24 patients received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion and CD19 CAR-T cells at or below the maximum tolerated dose (</= 2 x 10(6) CAR-T cells/kg). In 19 of these patients who were restaged, the overall response rate by IWCLL imaging criteria 4 weeks after infusion was 74% (CR, 4/19, 21%; PR, 10/19, 53%), and 15/17 patients (88%) with marrow disease before CAR-T cells had no disease by flow cytometry after CAR-T cells. Twelve of these patients underwent deep IGH sequencing, and seven (58%) had no malignant IGH sequences detected in marrow. Absence of the malignant IGH clone in marrow of patients with CLL who responded by IWCLL criteria was associated with 100% progression-free survival and overall survival (median 6.6 months follow-up) after CAR-T cell immunotherapy. The progression-free survival was similar in patients with lymph node PR or CR by IWCLL criteria. Conclusion CD19 CAR-T cells are highly effective in high-risk patients with CLL after they experience treatment failure with ibrutinib therapy.",,,,"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",PMC5590803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 3313 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent bone marrow transplantation from an HLA allele-matched unrelated donor (MUD) or 1MMUD between 2009 and 2014. We compared the outcomes of MUD (n=2089) and 1MMUD with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (1MM-ATG(+); n=109) with those of 1MMUD without ATG (1MM-ATG(-); n=1115). The median total dose of ATG (thymoglobulin) was 2.5 mg/kg (range 1.0-11.0 mg/kg) in the 1MM-ATG(+) group. The rates of grade III-IV acute GvHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and overall mortality were significantly lower in the MUD group than in the 1MM-ATG(-) group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, P=0.016; HR 0.74; P<0.001; and HR 0.87, P=0.020, respectively). Likewise, the rates of grade III-IV acute GVHD, NRM and overall mortality were significantly lower in the 1MM-ATG(+) group than in the 1MM-ATG(-) group (HR 0.42, P=0.035; HR 0.35, P<0.001; and HR 0.71, P=0.042, respectively). The outcome of allo-HCT from 1MM-ATG(-) was inferior to that of allo-HCT from MUD even in the recent cohort. However, the negative impact of 1MMUD disappeared with the use of low-dose ATG without increasing the risk of relapse.",,,,,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6704-3633'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK). The relative importance of inhibiting these 2 kinases has not been examined despite its relevance to immune-based therapies. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients on clinical trials of ibrutinib (BTK/ITK inhibitor; n = 19) or acalabrutinib (selective BTK inhibitor; n = 13) were collected serially. T cell phenotype, immune function, and CLL cell immunosuppressive capacity were evaluated. RESULTS: Ibrutinib markedly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in CLL patients. This effect was more prominent in effector/effector memory subsets and was not observed with acalabrutinib. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that this may be due to diminished activation-induced cell death through ITK inhibition. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression was significantly markedly reduced in T cells by both agents. While the number of Treg cells remained unchanged, the ratio of these to conventional CD4+ T cells was reduced with ibrutinib, but not acalabrutinib. Both agents reduced expression of the immunosuppressive molecules CD200 and BTLA as well as IL-10 production by CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib treatment increased the in vivo persistence of activated T cells, decreased the Treg/CD4+ T cell ratio, and diminished the immune-suppressive properties of CLL cells through BTK-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These features provide a strong rationale for combination immunotherapy approaches with ibrutinib in CLL and other cancers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01589302 and NCT02029443.

Epub 2017 Aug 22.,"Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has been a validated and attractive target for cancer therapy. Over-expression of Mcl-1 in many cancers allows cancer cells to evade apoptosis and contributes to the resistance to current chemotherapeutics. Here, we identified new Mcl-1 inhibitors using a multi-step virtual screening approach. First, based on two different ligand-receptor complexes, 20 pharmacophore models were established by simultaneously using 'Receptor-Ligand Pharmacophore Generation' method and manual build feature method, and then carefully validated by a test database. Then, pharmacophore-based virtual screening (PB-VS) could be performed by using the 20 pharmacophore models. In addition, docking study was used to predict the possible binding poses of compounds, and the docking parameters were optimized before performing docking-based virtual screening (DB-VS). Moreover, a 3D QSAR model was established by applying the 55 aligned Mcl-1 inhibitors. The 55 inhibitors sharing the same scaffold were docked into the Mcl-1 active site before alignment, then the inhibitors with possible binding conformations were aligned. For the training set, the 3D QSAR model gave a correlation coefficient r(2) of 0.996; for the test set, the correlation coefficient r(2) was 0.812. Therefore, the developed 3D QSAR model was a good model, which could be applied for carrying out 3D QSAR-based virtual screening (QSARD-VS). After the above three virtual screening methods orderly filtering, 23 potential inhibitors with novel scaffolds were identified. Furthermore, we have discussed in detail the mapping results of two potent compounds onto pharmacophore models, 3D QSAR model, and the interactions between the compounds and active site residues.",,['NOTNLM'],"['3D QSAR', 'Mcl-1', 'molecular docking', 'pharmacophore', 'virtual screening']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a model, we demonstrated the presence of differential addiction of cancer cells to anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1, which correlated with the respective protein expression ratio. ABT-263 (navitoclax), a BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor, prevented BCL-XL from sequestering activator BH3-only molecules (BH3s) and BAX but not BAK. Consequently, ABT-263 failed to kill BCL-XL-addicted cells with low activator BH3s and BCL-XL overabundance conferred resistance to ABT-263. High-throughput screening identified anthracyclines including doxorubicin and CDK9 inhibitors including dinaciclib that synergized with ABT-263 through downregulation of MCL-1. As doxorubicin and dinaciclib also reduced BCL-XL, the combinations of BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax) with doxorubicin or dinaciclib provided effective therapeutic strategies for SCLC. Altogether, our study highlights the need for mechanism-guided targeting of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins to effectively activate the mitochondrial cell death programme to kill cancer cells.",,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125562/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",PMC5520052,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5391-4936', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3595-0551']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 16.,"Background Tumor lysis syndrome results when intracellular contents are released during cell lysis. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma. Tumor lysis syndrome caused by ibrutinib therapy is potentially life threatening, but is rare and not often reported in clinical trials. Objective The purpose of this case series is to describe the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome in two patients initiated on ibrutinib, and to highlight the importance of close monitoring during therapy. Discussion One patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and one patient with mantle cell lymphoma developed laboratory and clinical tumor lysis syndrome following initiation of ibrutinib therapy. Assessment with the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale indicated one probable relationship and one possible relationship between ibrutinib therapy and tumor lysis syndrome. There were additional factors that may have confounded the laboratory and clinical factors observed, including baseline laboratory values and concurrent medications. Both patients were managed with supportive therapies. A literature review identified five additional reported cases of tumor lysis syndrome following ibrutinib therapy. Conclusion This case series identifies one patient with a probable relationship and one patient with a possible relationship between the development of tumor lysis syndrome and treatment with ibrutinib. Although uncommon, proper attention should be given to monitoring for this adverse drug reaction and appropriate follow-up should occur despite ibrutinib's ease of administration.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'ibrutinib', 'medication safety', 'tumor lysis syndrome']",,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 16.,"PURPOSE: Caring for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a distressing experience for parents without medical training. The experience can lead to parents' care burden. This study explored care burden among parents of children with ALL and its related factors. METHODS: A total of 130 parents were surveyed with the Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (SF-36), and a study specific demographic information questionnaire. Independent-samples T test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis (stepwise method), and binomial logistic regression were used in data analysis. RESULTS: The mean score of parents' care burden overall was 37.74 +/- 16.57, 17 (13.08%) had little or no burden, 57 (43.85%) had mild-to-moderate burden, 44 (33.84%) had moderate-to-severe burden, and 12 (9.23%) had severe burden. Regression analyses indicated daily care time, anxiety, general health, average monthly family income, social support, and number of co-caregivers were factors associated with care burden. These variables accounted for 51% of the variance in care burden. Other demographic information of parents and children, depression, and other dimensions of SF-36 were not related to care burden. The severe burden level was associated the increase risk of emotional distress compared with little or no burden group (OR = 37.500, 95% CI = 4.515-311.348, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that care burden in parents of children newly diagnosed with ALL is high. Parents with lower levels of care burden tend to have less daily care time, more co-caregivers, higher income, less anxiety, better general health, and social support. Strategies are needed to help reduce parents' care burden.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Care burden', '*Parent']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 15.,"Sepsis is an inflammatory response to pathogens (such as Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria), which has high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. The present study aimed to identify the key genes in Grampositive and Gramnegative sepsis. GSE6535 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, containing 17 control samples, 18 Grampositive samples and 25 Gramnegative samples. Subsequently, the limma package in R was used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Hierarchical clustering was conducted for the specific DEGs in Gramnegative and Gramnegative samples using cluster software and the TreeView software. To analyze the correlation of samples at the gene level, a similarity network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted for the DEGs using DAVID. Finally, stochastic perturbation was used to determine the significantly differential functions between Grampositive and Gramnegative samples. A total of 340 and 485 DEGs were obtained in Grampositive and Gramnegative samples, respectively. Hierarchical clustering revealed that there were significant differences between control and sepsis samples. In Grampositive and Gramnegative samples, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 was associated with apoptosis and programmed cell death. Additionally, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 was associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I assembly. Stochastic perturbation analysis revealed that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B2 (NDUFB2), NDUFB8 and ubiquinolcytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH) were associated with cellular respiration in Gramnegative samples, whereas large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) was associated with G1/S transition of the mitotic cell cycle in Grampositive samples. NDUFB2, NDUFB8 and UQCRH may be biomarkers for Gramnegative sepsis, whereas LATS2 may be a biomarker for Grampositive sepsis. These findings may promote the therapies of sepsis caused by Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria.",,,,,,PMC5548058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 13.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a special subtype of acute myeloid leukemia that responds to treatment with alltrans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. However, severe side effects and drug resistance limit the effectiveness of these treatments. Hence, new drugs for APL are required urgently. Shikonin, an active naphthoquinone derived from the Chinese medical herb Zi Cao exerts antitumor activity in several cancers. In the present study, the effects of shikonin on proliferation and apoptosis in NB4 cells, as well as related mechanisms were assessed. Treatment of NB4 cells with shikonin inhibited proliferation in a concentration and timedependent manner. The cell cycle was arrested in the G1 phase. NB4 cells treated with shikonin exhibited more apoptosis and higher levels of cleaved caspase3 and poly ADPribose polymerase than control cells. Western blotting results demonstrated that the expression of pp38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (pp38MAPK) and pcJun Nterminal kinase (pJNK) was increased significantly by shikonin treatment, while the expression of pERK and cMyc was decreased. In summary, these findings indicated that shikonin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis partly through modulation of the MAPKs and downregulation of cMyc.",,,,,"['0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",PMC5548061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, miR29a knockdown resulted in decreased apoptosis of hAMSCs and increased myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)1 at the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggested that EGM2 promoted survival of hAMSCs partly through the regulation of miR29a and MCL1 expression levels.

This study investigated the expression and functional role of MALAT-1 in AML. MALAT-1 expression was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR. After lentiviral-mediated MALAT-1 knockdown, the proliferation of AML cells was determined by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry and the expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9 was assessed by western blot analysis. We found that MALAT-1 expression in patients with acute monocytic leukemia (M5) was significantly increased when compared with that of healthy controls, and the overall survival of M5 patients with high MALAT-1 expression was markedly reduced when compared with the overall survival of patients with low MALAT-1 expression. The analysis of cellular experiments showed that MALAT-1 silencing decreased the proliferation of M5 cells (U-937 and THP-1), inhibited cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that high MALAT-1 expression is closely associated with poor prognosis in M5 patients and may play a role in leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis, and may serve as a promising theranostic marker.",,,,,"['0 (MALAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",PMC5549035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results revealed that low concentrations of SNX-2112 arrested the cells in the G2/M phase and induced their differentiation and apoptosis, possibly by suppressing Akt and inhibitor of kappaB kinase, a component of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathway. We also found that SNX-2112 increased the expression of the differentiation transcription factors PU.1 and CCAATenhancer-binding protein-alpha.

Many AML cases have been reported without any known cytogenetic abnormalities and carry no mutation in known AML-associated driver genes. In this study, 200 AML cases were selected from a publicly available cohort and differentially analyzed for genetic, epigenetic, and cytogenetic abnormalities. Three genes (FLT3, DNMT3A, and NPMc) are found to be predominantly mutated. We identified several aberrations to be associated with genome-wide methylation changes. These include Del (5q), T (15; 17), and NPMc mutations. Four aberrations-Del (5q), T (15; 17), T (9; 22), and T (9; 11)-are significantly associated with patient survival. Del (5q)-positive patients have an average survival of less than 1 year, whereas T (15; 17)-positive patients have a significantly better prognosis. Combining the methylation and mutation data reveals three distinct patient groups and four clusters of genes. We speculate that combined signatures have the better potential to be used for subclassification of AML, complementing cytogenetic signatures.

However, the role of SlaA in S. pyogenes pathogenesis is unclear. Herein, we report that SlaA induces the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) via the arachidonic acid signaling cascade. Notably, recombinant SlaA induced ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), resulting in enhanced adhesion of human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells. However, C134A, a variant enzyme with no enzymatic activity, did not induce such events. In addition, culture supernatants from S. pyogenes SSI-1 enhanced the adhesion of THP-1 cells to HUVECs, but culture supernatants from the DeltaslaA isogenic mutant strain had limited effects. Aspirin, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, prevented the adhesion of THP-1 cells to HUVECs and did not induce ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression in HUVECs treated with SlaA. However, zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, did not exhibit such effects. Furthermore, pre-administration of aspirin in mice intravenously injected with SlaA attenuated the transcriptional abundance of ICAM1 and VCAM1 in the aorta. These results suggested that SlaA from S. pyogenes stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial cells.

The disease is primarily found in those who are immunocompromised, but it may also manifest in immuno competent persons. Current therapy for the invasive disease includes early surgical debridement, antifungal therapy management of underlying predisposing factors. Early recognition of the disease and treating the underlying cause of mucormycosis, such as diabetes, are key to improving outcomes.

We used the reaction between salicylaldehyde and different diamine compounds, including diamine, ethanediamine, and o-phenylenediamine, determining the structure of obtained molecules by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. We thus evaluated the microbicidal and antitumor activity of these compounds, showing that salicylaldehyde-hydrazine hydrate Schiff base (compound 1a) significantly inhibited the growth of S. aureus; salicylaldehyde-o-phenylenediamine Schiff base (compound 1c) displayed a strong capability to inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cell lines K562 and HEL. Moreover, we observed that the antibacterial action of 1a might be associated with the regulation of the expression of key virulence genes in S. aureus. Compound 1c resulted in a strong apoptotic activity against leukemia cells, also affecting the cell cycle distribution. Overall, our novel N,N-disubstituted Schiff bases possess unique antibacterial or antitumor activities that exhibit the potent application prospect in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions, providing new insights for developing new antibacterial and anticancer chemical agents.",,,,,,PMC5497607,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5726-6481', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7447-643X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting costimulatory molecules with antagonist antibodies could dampen the excessive immune response that occurs, while preserving the beneficial graft vs leukemia (GVL) of the allogeneic response. Previous studies using a mouse model of GVHD have shown that targeting the T-cell Inducible COStimulator (ICOS, CD278) molecule is beneficial, but it is unclear whether the same applies to human cells. METHODS: Here, we assessed whether a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to human ICOS was able to antagonize the costimulatory signal delivered in vivo to human T cells. To test this hypothesis, we used a xenogeneic model of GVHD where human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were adoptively transferred in immunocompromised NOD.SCID.gc-null mice (NSG). RESULTS: In this model, control mice invariably lost weight and died by day 50. In contrast, 65% of the mice receiving a single injection of the anti-hICOS mAb survived beyond 100 days. Moreover, a significant improvement in survival was obtained in a curative xeno-GVHD setting. Mechanistically, administration of the anti-hICOS mAb was associated with a strong reduction in perivascular infiltrates in liver and lungs and reduction in frequencies and numbers of human T cells in the spleen. In addition, the mAb prevented T-cell expansion in the blood during xeno-GVHD. Importantly, GVHD-protected mice retained the ability to control the P815 mastocytoma cell line, mimicking GVL in humans. CONCLUSION: A mAb-targeting human ICOS alleviated GVHD without impairing GVL in a xenograft murine model. Thus, ICOS represents a promising target in the management of BMT, preventing GVHD while preserving GVL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD278', 'ICOS', 'NSG', 'antibodies', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'graft-vs-host disease', 'mice', 'monoclonal']",,,PMC5491549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no consensus on which markers are needed to be used in flow cytometry for the diagnosis of CLL. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CD43 and CD200 markers in the differential diagnosis between CLL and MCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this issue, 339 consecutive patients with CLL and MCL were included in the flow cytometry lymphoproliferative disease panel for evaluation of CD43 and CD200 expressions, but not in the Matutes scoring system. RESULTS: CD200 was expressed in 97.3% of atypical CLL cases, whereas it was dimly expressed in only 6.1% of MCL cases. CD43 expression was 95.7% in atypical CLL cases. In the MCL cases, its expression rate was 39.4%. CONCLUSION: CD43 and CD200 were found to be more valuable markers than CD22, CD79b, and FMC7. CD43 and CD200 could also be considered as definitive markers in atypical CLL patients, for whom the Matutes scoring system remains ineffective.",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD200 CD43.', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mantle cell lymphoma']",,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",PMC5972347,,Kronik Lenfositik Losemi ve Mantle Hucreli Lenfoma Ayirici Tanisinda CD200 ve CD43 Ekspresyonunun Rolu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with allogeneic T lymphocytes can control recurrences at the cost of inducing detrimental GVHD. Targeting T cell recognition on leukemia cells is therefore needed to overcome the problem and ensure safe and durable disease remission. In this review, we discuss adoptive cells therapy based on CD1-restricted T cells specific for tumor associated self-lipid antigens. CD1 molecules are identical in every individual and expressed essentially on mature hematopoietic cells and leukemia blasts, but not by parenchymatous cells, while lipid antigens are enriched in malignant cells and unlike to mutate upon immune-mediated selective pressure. Redirecting T cells against self-lipids presented by CD1 molecules can thus provide an appealing cell therapy strategy for acute leukemia that is patient-unrestricted and can minimize risks for GVHD, implying potential prognostic improvement for this cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The treatment response and survival rates were similar for younger and elderly patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of age on the treatment outcomes in patients with CML receiving front-line imatinib therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using age, 101 patients were divided into 3 groups: young (age, 18-44 years; YP), middle-age (age, 45-64 years; MP), and elderly (age, >/= 65 years; EP). The patients' clinical features, treatment responses, survival, and adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: The complete cytogenetic response rates were similar in all 3 groups (81.8% in YP, 86.8% in MP, and 76.7% in EP; P = .328). However, the major molecular response rate was greatest in the MP group (84.2% vs. 63.6% in the YP and 60.0% in the EP group; P < .001). Most of the nonhematologic adverse events (all grades) were in the EP group (40.0% vs. 27.3% in the YP and 21.1% in the MP group; P = .005). The estimated 6-year event-free survival in the MP group (75.5%) was significantly greater than that in the YP group (58.6%) or EP group (43.4%). Also, the estimated 6-year overall survival rate in the EP group (73.5%) was significantly lower than that in the YP group (90.8%) and MP group (86.4%) (P < .001 for all).

METHODS: To extract the plant oil, dried leaves were subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for up to 3 hours. For the phytochemical analysis, essential oil was subjected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Plant extraction was performed by macerating leaf powder of K. odoratissima (50 g) in 70% methanol (500 mL) at room temperature (25-28 degrees C) for 24 hours. To perform cytotoxicity assays, methanolic extract of K. odoratissima was tested against a panel of cell lines including MDA-MB468 (human breast cancer cell line), K562 (human leukemia cell line), SKOV3 (human ovarian cancer cell line), Y79 (human eye cancer cell line), A549 (lung cancer cell line), and HEK 293 (normal human embryonic kidney cell line). RESULTS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that sesquiterpens are dominant volatile components of the plant, followed by phthalides comprising 3-butyldine phthalide and 3-n-butyl phthalide, the latter compound being the major component of the leaf oil (25.1%). The leaf extract showed selective and dose-dependent cytotoxicity against MDA-MB468, K562, SKOV3, Y79, and A549 cancer cell lines with IC50 values (concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%) of 85 mug/mL, 70 mug/mL, 120 mug/mL, 82 mug/mL, and145 mug/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest a direct cytotoxic activity of K. odoratissima leaf extract against human cancer cell lines. This activity of K. odoratissima may find application in combination with traditional herbal medicines to develop a new anticancer pharmacopuncture therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Methods The bone marrow cells of 42 APL patients, NB4 cells and MR2 cells were collected and treated separately with 1 mumol/L arsenic trioxide (As2O3), 1 mumol/L tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As4S4), 1 mumol/L ATRA, 10 mg/L cytosine arabinoside, and 1 mg/L homoharringtonine. The changes of fluorescent signals before and after the treatment were detected by indirect immunofluorescence technique. Results The 87.5% of initial onset APL cases showed small fluorescent signals (fluorescent signals in the nucleus look like a starry sky, more than 30 fluorescent light dots per cell); 91.67% of complete remission APL cases manifested large fluorescent signals (fluorescent signals in the nucleus are larger, fewer than 30 fluorescent light dots per cell); and 83.33% of relapse APL cases presented small fluorescent signals. Compared with control group without medication, the PML protein expression of APL cells in initial onset cases had larger fluorescent signals in the ATRA group, As2O3 group and As4S4 group, whereas there were no significant changes in the arabinoside cytosine group and the homoharringtonine group. In addition, ATRA transformed the PML protein expression of NB4 cells from small fluorescent signals into large ones, but did not change small fluorescent signals of the PML protein expression in MR2 cells. Also, As2O3 and As4S4 turned the PML protein expression of NB4 and MR2 cells from small fluorescent signals into large ones.

Epub 2017 Jul 15.,"BACKGROUND: Compromised physical fitness and cognitive difficulties have been reported as late effects of cancer treatment during childhood. To assess this issue, the military rankings of cancer survivors in medical checkups at call-up, and conscripts' physical and cognitive performance during the first weeks of compulsory military education were compared to those of matched population controls without a history of cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1680 male patients born between 1960 and 1992 with a malignancy diagnosed before the age of 16 who were alive at the call-up age (18 years) were identified using the Finnish Cancer Registry, and five age, sex and place of residence matched controls for each patient using the Population Register Centre. Data on military service were gathered from Finnish Defense Forces. A conditional logistic regression analysis, the GEE-method with the cumulative logit link function, the chi-square test, the chi-square test for trend and a one-way analysis of variance were used in different analyses. RESULTS: Cancer survivors were exempted from military service more often than the controls (p < .001). The fit-for-service frequency was highest for survivors of kidney tumors (68%) and lowest after irradiated brain tumors (19%). In service, the results of the 12-min running test were poorer than those of controls for leukemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p = .03) and brain tumor (p = .01) survivors. Interestingly, the standing long-jump test was the only muscle test for which survivor groups performed worse than controls. Performance on cognitive tests only differed from controls in brain tumor survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Exemption from service is still common under the current guidelines, but fit-for-service survivors do well in military education. These results can be used for reassuring survivors that completion of military service is possible for those fulfilling the national general guidelines for military fitness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 23-year-old woman with ALL presented to the ophthalmology clinic with bilateral subacute visual loss. RESULTS: Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral serous retinal detachments and unilateral optic disc swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging for differential diagnosis was inconclusive; however, cerebrospinal fluid sampling demonstrated leukemic involvement of the central nervous system. The patient's vision improved and fundus findings resolved with the institution of systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Serous retinal detachment and optic disc swelling are unusual ocular manifestations of ALL. They may occur due to leukemic infiltration of ocular structures and may indicate extramedullary recurrence of the disease.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study, we first evaluated the expression rates of CD14, CD34, CD45, CD44, CD29, and Sca-1 surface markers on MSCs by flow cytometry. Then, the ability of osteogenic and fatty differentiation of MSCs was determined by osteogenic differentiation and adipogenesis reagent kit. Next, Annexin V-APC/7-AAD apoptosis kit was used for detecting the apoptosis rate of MSCs. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used for detection of mRNA expression and proteins expression, respectively. RESULTS Our data showed that the MSCs used in our study were capable of self-renewal and differentiating into many cell lineages, such as osteogenic differentiation and adipogenesis. Our results further showed that over-expression of PGC-1alpha could protect MSCs from apoptosis induced by rotenone. We also found that PGC-1alpha over-expression could enhance the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, and inhibit the expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax in MSCs. In addition, our data demonstrated that PGC-1alpha could induce upregulation of Bcl-2 and further promote the survival of MSCs by interacting with ERRalpha.

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"We sought to develop a myeloablative chemotherapeutic regimen to secure consistent engraftment of T-cell depleted (TCD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) without the need for total body irradiation, thereby reducing toxicity while maintaining low rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and without increasing relapse. We investigated the myeloablative combination of busulfan (Bu) and melphalan (Mel), with the immunosuppressive agents fludarabine (Flu) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as cytoreduction before a TCD HSCT. No post-transplantation immunosuppression was administered. Between April 2001 and May 2008, 102 patients (median age, 55 years) with a diagnosis of primary or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) underwent cytoreduction with Bu/Mel/Flu, followed by TCD grafts. TCD was accomplished by CD34(+)-selection followed by E-rosette depletion for peripheral blood stem cell grafts and, for bone marrow grafts, by soybean agglutination followed by E-rosette depletion. Donors included matched and mismatched, related and unrelated donors. Risk stratification was by American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk categorization for patients with primary disease. For patients with secondary/treatment-related MDS/AML, those in complete remission (CR) 1 or with refractory anemia were classified as intermediate risk, and all other patients were considered high risk. Neutrophil engraftment occurred at a median of 11 days in 100 of 101 evaluable patients. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute and chronic GVHD at 1 year were 8.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Overall- and disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 5 years were 50.0% and 46.1%, respectively, and the cumulative incidences of relapse and treatment-related mortality were 23.5% and 28.4%, respectively. Stratification by risk group demonstrated superior DFS for low-risk patients (61.5% at 5 years) compared with intermediate- or high-risk (34.2% and 40.0%, respectively, P = .021). For patients with AML, those in CR1 had superior 5-year DFS compared with those in >/=CR2 (60% and 30.6%, respectively, P = .01), without a significant difference in incidence of relapse (17.1% and 30.6%, respectively, P = .209). There were no differences in DFS for other patient, donor, or disease characteristics. In summary, cytoreduction with Bu/Mel/Flu and r-ATG secured consistent engraftment of TCD transplantations. The incidences of acute/chronic GVHD and disease relapse were low, with favorable outcomes in this patient population with high-risk myeloid malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To clarify the arsenic species in APL patients, high performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-HG-AFS) and HG-AFS methods were developed and validated to quantify the plasma concentrations of inorganic arsenic (As(III) and As(V)) and methylated metabolites (MMA and DMA), and the total amounts of arsenic in blood cells and plasma. Blood cells and plasma were digested with mixtures of HNO3H2O2 and analyzed by HG-AFS. For arsenic speciation, plasma samples were prepared with perchloric acid to precipitate protein. The supernatant was separated on an anion-exchange column within 6min with isocratic elution using 13mM CH3COONa, 3mM NaH2PO4, 4mM KNO3 and 0.2mM EDTA-2Na. The methods provided linearity range of 0.2-20ng/mL for total arsenic and 2.0-50ng/mL for four arsenic species. The developed methods for total arsenic and arsenic species determination were precise and accurate. The spiked recoveries ranged from 81.2%-108.6% and the coefficients of variation for intra- and inter-batch precision were less than 9.3% and 12.5%, respectively. The developed methods were applied successfully for the assay of total arsenic and arsenic species in 5 APL patients.

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND: We sought to describe the distribution and impact of comorbidities on outcomes in patients with myelofibrosis, a disease characterized by aberrant bone marrow function with eventual fibrosis. Comorbidities were scored using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) and the Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI), in which a score >/= 3 indicates severe comorbidities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 306 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of myelofibrosis. Patients were seen from 1999 to 2014 with a median follow-up of 2 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess the impact of comorbidities on overall survival and leukemic transformation from the date of presentation to our center. A series of descriptive analyses were performed examining the distribution of comorbidities captured by the scales. RESULTS: On multivariable survival analysis, an ACE-27 score of 3 was associated with an almost twofold increase in the risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.58; P = .03) compared with a lower score of 0 to 1. An HCT-CI score >/= 3 was marginally significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause death (HR 1.60; 95% CI 0.96-2.68; P = .07). ACE-27 captured a greater spectrum of cardiovascular and venous thrombotic disease. No impact of comorbidities on leukemic transformation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the presence of severe comorbidities was lower when assessed by ACE-27 (13%) compared with HCT-CI (23%), and the spectrums of comorbidities captured were different, the overall impact of severe comorbidities as assessed by both scales appears to be similar and associated with a survival disadvantage.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Aug 11.,"High PRDM16 (also known as MEL1) expression is a representative marker of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with NUP98-NSD1 and is a significant predictive marker for poor prognosis in pediatric AML. However, the clinical features of adult AML with PRDM16 expression remain unclear. PRDM16 is highly homologous to MDS1/EVI1, which is an alternatively spliced transcript of MECOM (also known as EVI1). We investigated PRDM16 expression in 151 AML patients, with 47 (31%) exhibiting high PRDM16 expression (PRDM16/ABL1 ratio >/= 0.010). High PRDM16 expression significantly correlated with DNMT3A (43% vs. 15%, P < 0.001) and NPM1 (43% vs. 21%, P = 0.010) mutations and partial tandem duplication of KMT2A (22% vs. 1%, P < 0.001). Remarkably, high-PRDM16-expression patients were frequent in the noncomplete remission group (48% vs. 21%, P = 0.002). Overall survival (OS) was significantly worse in high-PRDM16-expression patients than in low-PRDM16-expression patients (5-year OS, 18% vs. 34%; P = 0.002). This trend was observed more clearly among patients aged <65 years (5-year OS, 21% vs. 50%; P = 0.001), particularly in FLT3-ITD-negative patients in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group (5-year OS, 25% vs. 59%; P = 0.009). These results suggest that high PRDM16 expression is a significant predictive marker for poor prognosis in adult AML patients, similar to pediatric AML patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PRDM16 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4000-0753', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3753-9862', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7271-3454']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study cohort consisted of 14 patients (median age 66 years, range 52-77 years) with newly diagnosed AML following solid organ transplantation. The median interval time between solid organ transplantation and AML diagnosis was 72 months (range 15-368 months). Seven patients received standard induction chemotherapy, four patients received intermediate type therapy, and the remaining three patients were deemed not fit for therapy and received palliative and supportive care. Six of the 11 treated patients (55%) achieved complete remission (CR). The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 6 months. The median OS for the patients who achieved complete remission after therapy was 17 months and 2 months for the remaining patients.

We developed several variants of the widely used TUNEL methodology that is based on the use of exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) to label 3'OH ends in DSBs with fluorochromes. Flow- or image-cytometry is then employed to detect and quantify apoptotic cells labeled this way. Here, we describe a variant of this technique using BrdUTP as a TdT substrate. The incorporated BrdU is subsequently visualized by a fluorochrome-tagged antibody. This is a particularly simple, rapid, and sensitive approach to detect DSBs.We also describe modifications of the labeling protocol permitting the use of deoxyribonucleotides other than BrdUTP to label DSBs. Concurrent differential staining of cellular DNA and multiparameter analysis of cells by flow- or image-cytometry enable correlations between apoptosis induction and the cell cycle phase.

Overexpression of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 accounts for survival and self-renewal of LSCs. AT101 binds to the BH3 motif of all Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins and demonstrates anti-tumor activity in multiple types of tumor. Thus, we hypothesized that this agent might have the potential to deplete LSCs. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to investigate if and by what mechanism AT101 is able to target AML stem-like cells. METHODS: As LSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are enriched in CD34(+)CD38(-) populations, CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from KG1alpha and Kasumi-1 cell lines as well as CD34(+) blasts from AML patients were used as LSC models, while CD34(+) cells from healthy donors were used as normal hematopoietic cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and an Annexin V/PI assay using flow cytometry, respectively. Colony-forming units experiments were performed to monitor the stemness features of AML cells. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis were performed to examine the levels of proteins and mRNAs related to either the intrinsic apoptotic pathway or DNA damage response. RESULTS: AT101 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1alpha and Kasumi-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Exposure to AT101 for 24 h resulted in apoptosis in primary CD34(+) AML blasts (EC50 [concentration needed for a 50% maximal effect] = 2.45-76.00 mumol/L), while it only had a modest effect on normal CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, AT101 activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by inhibition of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins, reflected by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, AT101 caused DNA damage (e.g., increased gammaH2AX phosphorylation), which might also contribute to its anti-leukemic effects. Interestingly, the ex vivo efficacy of AT101 in primary AML samples significantly correlated to hyperleukocytosis and FLT3-ITD mutations. AT101 was also effective against CD34(+) blasts isolated from elderly patients and patients who did not achieve complete remission after induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: AT101 effectively eliminates LSCs in vitro through the induction of DNA damage and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. AT101 is effective towards leukemic cells from patients with adverse prognostic factors, suggesting that AT101 could have the potential as an alternative salvage therapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML.",,,,"['No. 81428003/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'No. 81428004/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'No. 81570156/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'No. 2014A030313355/Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province/International', 'No. 2015B020227003/The Guangdong Provincial Basic Research Program/International']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7271-4438'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unusual presentations, especially paraneoplastic syndromes are rare.

Workup for suspected plasma cell dyscrasia led instead to the diagnosis of bone marrow infiltration by atypical CLL without lymphocytosis. Renal biopsy showed a glomerulonephritis that turned out to be paraneoplastic as it went into remission after treatment for CLL.

Epub 2017 Jul 14.,"Rituximab (RTX) has been the hallmark anti-CD20 mAb for the treatment of B cell neoplasms, including B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Recently, a novel humanized anti-CD20 mAb obinutuzumab (GA101) has been implemented as first-line CLL therapy. Treatment of CLL patients with RTX is associated with CD20 loss via an FcgammaR-mediated process, trogocytosis. RTX-induced trogocytosis has been characterized as both the means of resistance to therapy, via loss of cell surface target proteins (antigenic modulation), as well as a process that alters B cell phenotype and function. This study investigates the nature and clinical relevance of GA101-mediated trogocytosis. In this study, we demonstrate that GA101 is a more potent mediator of trogocytosis than RTX in vitro in both normal B cells and B-CLL cells. Qualitative differences in the effector function of these anti-CD20 Abs appear specific to B-CLL cells. GA101-mediated CD19 and CD20 trogocytosis from B-CLL cells is associated with its ability to induce homotypic adhesion (HA). The degree of HA varies between CLL patients and positively correlates with the expression of ZAP-70, a BCR-associated kinase. Deregulation of ZAP-70 using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib or ibrutinib, diminishes HA formation and trogocytosis by GA101. Taken together, these findings elucidate the differences in trogocytosis and HA formation mediated by anti-CD20 mAbs RTX and GA101, as well as provide a novel link between ZAP-70 expression and these effector functions.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 14.,"Understanding and blocking the self-renewal pathway of preleukemia stem cells could prevent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. In this study, we show that increased FOXO1 represents a critical mechanism driving aberrant self-renewal in preleukemic cells expressing the t(8;21)-associated oncogene AML1-ETO (AE). Although generally considered as a tumor suppressor, FOXO1 is consistently upregulated in t(8;21) AML. Expression of FOXO1 in human CD34(+) cells promotes a preleukemic state with enhanced self-renewal and dysregulated differentiation. The DNA binding domain of FOXO1 is essential for these functions. FOXO1 activates a stem cell molecular signature that is also present in AE preleukemia cells and preserved in t(8;21) patient samples. Genome-wide binding studies show that AE and FOXO1 share the majority of their binding sites, whereby FOXO1 binds to multiple crucial self-renewal genes and is required for their activation. In agreement with this observation, genetic and pharmacological ablation of FOXO1 inhibited the long-term proliferation and clonogenicity of AE cells and t(8;21) AML cell lines. Targeting of FOXO1 therefore provides a potential therapeutic strategy for elimination of stem cells at both preleukemic and leukemic stages.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'M01 RR008084/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK090971/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR026314/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",PMC5606002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"The aim of the present work was to assess whether polymorphisms in genes coding for drug transport proteins may influence dosing, efficacy and toxicity of maintenance therapy with methotrexate (MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 41 children with ALL were screened for 10 SNPs in the SLC19A1, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC4 and ABCG2 transporter genes by means of direct sequencing. Carriers of the ABCC4 934CC and ABCB1 1236TT genotypes received a lower percentage of the protocol-recommended starting dose of MTX (62.1 vs. 81.3% for 934CA carriers, p=0.001) and 6MP (73.1 vs. 87.7% for 1236CC/CT carriers; p=0.026), respectively. The C1236T SNP also increased the efficiency of myelosuppression. Median (and interquartile) number of blood tests with leukocytes levels <310(9)/L for the CC; CT and TT genotypes were 22 (13), 30.5 (11.75) and 33 (17.25), respectively (p=0.001). In addition, this SNP also correlated with the number of hematological adverse events (p=0.004 for the difference between same genotypes). The event more profoundly affected was neutropenia (p=0.004). In the same manner, the ABCC4 934CC genotype was also associated to more frequent hematological toxicity (p=0.041 vs. CT carriers) and raised LDH levels (p=0.004 vs. CT carriers); although only the latter association remained significant after correction by multiple testing. Overall, our findings indicate that variability in the ABCB1 and ABCC4 genes may confer higher sensitivity to maintenance chemotherapy of ALL, and therefore its determination may be helpful in individualizing this treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2017 Jun 24.,"BACKGROUND: With the improving outcomes of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), it is imperative to focus on survivorship issues, including the development of second primary malignancies (SPMs). We used a large US database to measure the risk of SPMs among FL survivors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-13 registry to identify FL patients from 1992 to 2011. We calculated the risk of SPMs, developing >/= 6 months after diagnosis, using the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and absolute excess risk. We calculated the cumulative incidence of SPMs using the competing risk method and risk factors for SPMs using univariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Of a total of 15,517 patients with FL followed up for a median of 71 months, 1540 (9.9%) developed SPMs, with a SIR of 1.08 and absolute excess risk of 11.3 per 10,000 person-years. A significantly increased risk was noted for Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 5.85), acute myeloid leukemia (SIR, 4.88), and the following sites: oral cavity and pharynx (SIR, 1.43), stomach (SIR, 1.43), lung and bronchus (SIR, 1.35), melanoma of skin (SIR, 1.38), other nonepithelial cancers of the skin (SIR, 2.88), urinary bladder (SIR, 1.24), and kidney/renal pelvis (SIR, 1.43). The cumulative incidence of SPMs was 11.06% at 10 years. Multivariate regression showed that age > 65 years (SIR, 1.57; P < .001), male gender (SIR, 1.43; P < .001), and receipt of radiation (SIR, 1.24; P = .001) predicted a higher rate of SPMs. CONCLUSION: Patients with FL have increased risk of both hematologic and solid malignancies. Risk factors for SPMs include advanced age, male gender, and receipt of radiation therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Even though the patterns of those mutations are well explored in many tumors, the dynamical process of clonal selection is underexposed. METHODS: We studied the dynamics of clonal competition in a BcrAbl-induced leukemia using a gamma-retroviral vector library encoding the oncogene in conjunction with genetic barcodes. To this end, we studied the growth dynamics of transduced cells on the clonal level both in vitro and in vivo in transplanted mice. RESULTS: While we detected moderate changes in clonal abundancies in vitro, we observed monoclonal leukemias in 6/30 mice after transplantation, which intriguingly were caused by only two different BcrAbl clones. To analyze the success of these clones, we applied a mathematical model of hematopoietic tissue maintenance, which indicated that a differential engraftment capacity of these two dominant clones provides a possible explanation of our observations. These findings were further supported by additional transplantation experiments and increased BcrAbl transcript levels in both clones. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that clonal competition is not an absolute process based on mutations, but highly dependent on selection mechanisms in a given environmental context.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BcrAbl', '*Clonal competition', '*Clonal dynamics', '*Genetic barcodes', '*Heterogeneity', '*Leukemia', '*Mathematical modelling']",,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",PMC5512731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) occurs in approximately 1:1500 children and is less frequently found in adults. The most common immunophenotype of ALL is the B cell lineage and within B cell precursor ALL, specific genetic aberrations define subtypes with distinct biological and clinical characteristics. With more advanced genetic analysis methods such as whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, novel genetic subtypes have recently been discovered. One novel class of genetic aberrations comprises tyrosine kinase-activating lesions, including translocations and rearrangements of tyrosine kinase and cytokine receptor genes. These newly discovered genetic aberrations are harder to detect by standard diagnostic methods such as karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because they are diverse and often cryptic. These lesions involve one of several tyrosine kinase genes (among others, v-abl Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 1 (ABL1), v-abl Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (ABL2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta polypeptide (PDGFRB)), each of which can be fused to up to 15 partner genes. Together, they compose 2-3% of B cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), which is similar in size to the well-known fusion gene BCR-ABL1 subtype. These so-called BCR-ABL1-like fusions are mutually exclusive with the sentinel translocations in BCP-ALL (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements) and have the promising prospect to be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors similar to BCR-ABL1. In this review, we discuss the types of tyrosine kinase-activating lesions discovered, and the preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of this novel subtype of ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Herein, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of idarubicin and cytarabine with either clofarabine (CIA) or fludarabine (FIA) in adults with newly diagnosed AML. Adults with newly diagnosed AML who were deemed suitable for intensive chemotherapy were randomized using a Bayesian adaptive design to receive CIA (106 patients) or FIA (76 patients). Patients received induction with idarubicin and cytarabine, plus either clofarabine or fludarabine. Responding patients could receive up to 6 cycles of consolidation therapy. Outcomes were compared with a historical cohort of patients who received idarubicin and cytarabine. RESULTS: The complete remission/complete remission without platelet recovery rate was similar among patients in the CIA and FIA arms (80% and 82%, respectively). The median event-free survival was 13 months and 12 months, respectively (P = .91), and the median overall survival was 24 months and not reached, respectively (P = .23), in the 2 treatment arms. CIA was associated with more adverse events, particularly transaminase elevation, hyperbilirubinemia, and rash. Early mortality was similar in the 2 arms (60-day mortality rate of 4% for CIA vs 1% for FIA; P = .32). In an exploratory analysis of patients aged <50 years, FIA was found to be associated with improved survival compared with idarubicin and cytarabine (2-year event-free survival rate: 58% vs 30% [P = .05] and 2-year overall survival rate: 72% vs 36% [P = .009]). CONCLUSIONS: CIA and FIA have similar efficacy in younger patients with newly diagnosed AML, although FIA is associated with a better toxicity profile. Cancer 2017;123:4430-9.

However, the function of Jak in bone metabolism remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that the inhibition of Jak1 and/or Jak2 in osteoblast-lineage cells led to impaired osteoclastogenesis due to the reduced expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL). Murine calvaria-derived osteoblasts induced differentiation of bone marrow cells into osteoclasts in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in vitro. However, treatment with the Jak1/2 inhibitor, baricitinib, markedly inhibited osteoclastogenesis in the co-culture. On the other hand, baricitinib did not inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages. These results indicated that baricitinib acted on osteoblasts, but not on bone marrow macrophages. Baricitinib suppressed 1,25D3 and PGE2-induced up-regulation of RANKL in osteoblasts, but not macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression. Moreover, the addition of recombinant RANKL to co-cultures completely rescued baricitinib-induced impairment of osteoclastogenesis. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Jak1 or Jak2 also suppressed RANKL expression in osteoblasts and inhibited osteoclastogenesis.

The activating receptor natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) plays a key role in regulating immune responses driven by gammadelta T cells. Here, we explored whether recombinant immunoligands consisting of a CD20 single-chain fragment variable (scFv) linked to a NKG2D ligand, either MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA) or UL16 binding protein 2 (ULBP2), could be employed to engage gammadelta T cells for tumour cell killing. The two immunoligands, designated MICA:7D8 and ULBP2:7D8, respectively, enhanced cytotoxicity of ex vivo-expanded gammadelta T cells against CD20-positive lymphoma cells. Both Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 gammadelta T cells were triggered by MICA:7D8 or ULBP2:7D8. Killing of CD20-negative tumour cells was not induced by the immunoligands, indicating their antigen specificity. MICA:7D8 and ULBP2:7D8 acted in a dose-dependent manner and induced cytotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells isolated from patients were sensitized by the two immunoligands for gammadelta T cell cytotoxicity. In a combination approach, the immunoligands were combined with bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP), an agonist for Vdelta2 gammadelta T cells, which further enhanced the efficacy in target cell killing. Thus, employing tumour-directed recombinant immunoligands which engage NKG2D may represent an attractive strategy to enhance antitumour cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

One of the hallmarks of cancer is the energy shift toward glycolysis. Low OXPHOS activity and increased glycolysis are associated with aggressive types of cancer. Mitochondria have their own genome (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]) encoding for 13 essential subunits of the OXPHOS enzyme complexes. We studied mtDNA in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to detect potential pathogenic mutations in OXPHOS complexes. The whole mtDNA from blood and bone marrow samples at diagnosis and follow-up from 36 ALL patients were analyzed. Novel or previously described pathogenic mtDNA mutations were identified in 8 out of 36 patients. Six out of these 8 patients had died from ALL. Five out of 36 patients had an identified poor prognosis genetic marker, and 4 of these patients had mtDNA mutations. Missense or nonsense mtDNA mutations were detected in the genes encoding subunits of OXPHOS complexes, as follows: MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4L and MT-ND6 of complex I; MT-CO3 of complex IV; and MT-ATP6 and MT-ATP8 of complex V.

Ibrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown remarkable efficacy in CLL; however, little is known about its relationship to RS. We report a case of ibrutinib efficacy against CLL in a patient with prolonged remission of RS. METHODS: The patient was diagnosed with CLL in 2003. Biological findings at onset included absent ZAP70 expression, mutated IGVH, and NOTCH1 mutation. He was treated with FCR with partial response. In 2013, he progressed to RS, not clonally related to the underlying CLL. The patient was treated with anthracycline- and platinum-based regimens, obtaining a complete remission. After 3 years, he presented a CLL progression with worsening lymphocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathies. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan excluded pathologic uptake. Thus, he was started on ibrutinib. RESULTS: At 12 months' follow-up, we observed white blood cell normalization, increased hemoglobin and platelet levels, disappearance of lymphadenopathy, and spleen size reduction. Therapy was well-tolerated with no evidence of RS. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates sustained RS remission in a patient with CLL under ibrutinib therapy, thus improving our knowledge on the use of this new drug in CLL and beyond.",,,,,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many useful properties of this fruit are attributed to bioactive compounds. Zucchini fruits (""Yellow"" and ""Light Green"" varieties) and four distinctive components (lutein, beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and dehydroascorbic acid) were selected. Firstly, the lutein, beta-carotene, zeaxanthin and dehydroascorbic acid contents were determined in these fruits. Then, in order to evaluate the safety and suitability of their use, different assays were carried out: (i) genotoxicity and anti-genotoxicity tests to determine the safety and DNA-protection against hydrogen peroxide; (ii) cytotoxicity; and (iii) DNA fragmentation and Annexin V/PI (Propidium Iodide) assays to evaluate the pro-apoptotic effect. Results showed that: (i) all the substances were non-genotoxic; (ii) all the substances were anti-genotoxic except the highest concentration of lutein; (iii) ""Yellow"" zucchini epicarp and mesocarp exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity (IC50 > 0.1 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively); and (iv) ""Light Green"" zucchini skin induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, beta-carotene being the possible molecule responsible for its pro-apoptotic activity. To sum up, zucchini fruit could play a positive role in human health and nutrition due to this fruit and its components were safe, able to inhibit significantly the H(2)O(2)-induced damage and exhibit anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities toward HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia cells) tumor cells.

Using a transgenic mouse model, we previously demonstrated that homeobox (HOX) gene HOXA9 genetically interact with E2A-PBX1 gene in the development of B-cell leukemia in mice. HOXA9 itself is a potent oncogene resulting in myeloid leukemia when overexpressed, which is strongly accelerated by its collaborator Meis1. HOX, PBX1 and MEIS1 proteins have been shown to form hetero dimeric or trimeric complexes in different combinations. Cooperative interaction between PBX1 and HOX proteins enhances their DNA binding specificity, essential for HOX dependent developmental programs. PBX1 is retained in E2A-PBX1, and thus the strong transcriptional activator properties of E2A-PBX1 may lead to aberrant activation of normally repressed targets of HOX-PBX complexes. However, although there is evidence that E2A-PBX1 could bind to HOX and MEIS1 proteins it is still unclear whether such complexes are actually required for leukemic transformation or whether E2A-PBX1 and HOXA9 are each part of larger protein complexes acting in independent complementing oncogenic pathways. In this study we aim to search for other HOXA9 and E2A-PBX1 interacting proteins. To identify novel proteins interacting with human E2A-PBX1 or HOXA9 we used tandem affinity purification (TAP) of protein complexes from 697 pre-B leukemic and HeLa cell lines transduced to express E2A-PBX1 or HOXA9, respectively, with covalently attached FLAG/HA peptides. The protein composition of each complex was determined using tandem mass-spectrometry. In the E2A-PBX1 containing complex we identified lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, chromatin remodeling factors of SWI/SNF family while multiple subunits of translation initiation factor eIF3, E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 emerged from the HOXA9 complex as potential critical protein partners. This is the first time the protein partners of either E2A-PBX1 or HOXA9 oncoproteins were identified using an unbiased biochemical approach. The identification of translation initiation factors associated with HOXA9 might indicate a novel function for HOX proteins independent of their transcriptional activity.",,['NOTNLM'],"['E2A-PBX1', 'HOXA9', 'associated proteins', 'oncogenic potential', 'oncoproteins', 'tandem affinity purification', 'tandem mass-spectrometry', 'transcription factors']",,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SWI-SNF-B chromatin-remodeling complex)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (UBR5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 14.,"The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are key nodes in oncogenic signalling pathways controlling growth, survival, and motility of cancer cells. Their activity is increased in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. To date, PAK deregulation has mainly been studied in solid tumours, where PAK1 and PAK4 are the main isoforms deregulated. We show that PAK1 and PAK2 are the critical isoforms in a BCR/ABL1(+) haematopoietic malignancy. In suspension, leukaemic cells deficient for PAK1 and PAK2 undergo apoptosis, while the loss of either protein is well tolerated. Transfer of medium conditioned by shPAK2- but not shPAK1-expressing leukaemic cells interferes with endothelial cell growth. We found that leukaemic cells produce exosomes containing PAK2. Transfer of isolated exosomes supports endothelial cell proliferation. In parallel, we found that leukaemic cells explicitly require PAK2 to grow towards an extracellular matrix. PAK2-deficient cells fail to form colonies in methylcellulose and to induce lymphomas in vivo. PAK2 might therefore be the critical isoform in leukaemic cells by controlling tumour growth in a dual manner: vascularization via exosome-mediated transfer to endothelial cells and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. This finding suggests that the PAK2 isoform represents a promising target for the treatment of haematological diseases.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Epub 2017 Jul 13.,"In mammalian cells, the DNA damage response (DDR) prevents the replication and propagation of DNA errors to the next generation, thus maintaining genomic stability. At the heart of the DDR are the related signaling kinases ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, which regulate DNA repair and associated events such as cell cycle checkpoints, chromatin remodeling, transcription, and ultimately apoptosis. Several findings highlight the occurrence of DDR in hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and persistence of DNA lesions in these cells promotes their functional decline and accumulation of leukemogenic mutations. Besides favoring tumor formation and progression, molecular defects that directly or indirectly inactivate certain DDR pathways can provide a therapeutic opportunity, since a reduced ability to repair DNA lesions renders hemopoietic malignancies vulnerable to genotoxic drugs acting also through synthetic lethal interactions. Here, we discuss the essential role of DDR in HSC maintenance and protection against leukemogenesis, and how acquired DDR dysfunctions or pharmacological agents that block this pathway can be effectively exploited for the treatment of various hematopoietic malignancies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM kinase', 'ATR kinase', 'DNA damage response', 'DNA repair', 'Hemopoietic stem cell', 'Leukemogenesis']",,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic activities of the quinazolinone derivatives in various cell lines including: HeLa, L1210 (mouse lymphocytic leukemia) and HT29 (human colon adenocarcinoma) were reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a number of newly made tricycles quinazolinone derivatives such as fused pyridazino-quinazolinones and fused pyrrolo-quinazolinones were evaluated on two cancerous cell lines, melanoma (B16F10) and prostate (PC3) using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay. RESULTS: The results of cytotoxicity evaluations indicated that almost all of the compounds at the concentrations of 10 and 100 muM showed significant differences in viability in comparison with negative control at 48 h exposure (P < 0.05). However, during 24 h exposure some of the compounds showed cytotoxicity activity. CONCLUSION: Results showed that both cell lines were sensitive to synthesized compounds and longer duration of exposure (48 h) had better results compared to that of 24 h screening.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxic', 'melanoma and prostate cancer', 'quinazolinone']",,,PMC5501066,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib was the first approved TKI for CML in 2001. Nilotinib is a second-generation TKI, approved in 2007; it inhibits BCR-ABL, PDGFR, and c-KIT, and is 30 times more potent than imatinib. Tyrosine kinase enzymes are expressed in multiple tissues and are involved in several signaling pathways; they have been shown to have several off-target side effects. CASE REPORT We report a case of an elderly male with CML and no history of gastrointestinal diseases, treated with nilotinib, and developed recurrent gastric polyps after three years of treatment. We excluded common causes of gastric polyps and therefore considered nilotinib as a probable cause of recurrent gastric polyps.

Epub 2017 Jul 10.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed that some cell population data (CPD) parameters of neutrophils may be useful for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes and sepsis, for the differential diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and some CPD parameters of lymphocytes may be a valuable tool for preliminary screening of B cell lymphoproliferative disease. Notwithstanding the knowledge, no information has been made available about their analytical quality specification. This study was aimed to define short- and medium-term biological variation (BV) estimates and reference change value (RCV) of leukocyte count, extended leukocyte differential and CPD. METHODS: The study population consisted of 43 healthy volunteers, who participated in the assessment of medium-term (21 volunteers; blood sampling once a week for 5 consecutive weeks) and short-term (22 volunteers; blood sampling once a day for 5 consecutive days) BV, using Sysmex XN. Outlier analysis was carried out before CV-ANOVA, to determine BV estimates and their confidence intervals. RESULTS: The medium-term and short-term within-subject BV (CVI) was comprised between 0.6-19.7% and 0.2-21.9%, whereas the medium-term and short-term between-subjects BV (CVG) was comprised between 1.2-61.5% and 1.1-58.5%. The RCVs were found to be similar for all the parameters, in both arms of the study, except for some CPD parameters. CONCLUSION: This study allowed accurately estimating the BV of many leukocyte parameters, some of which have not been currently explored. The kinetics of some leukocyte turnover suggests the use of short-term BV data for calculating analytical goals and RCV.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2017 Jul 10.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy with an exceedingly poor prognosis: a 5-year overall survival rate of 40%-45% in the young and a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% in the elderly (>60 years of age). Although a high percentage of patients enters complete remission after chemotherapeutic intervention, the majority of patients relapse within 3 years. Such stark prognostic outcomes highlight the need for additional clinical research, basic discovery, and molecular delineation of the etiologies and mechanisms behind responses to therapy that lead to relapse. Here, we summarize recent discoveries in tumor heterogeneity at the genetic and epigenetic levels and their independent molecular trajectories and dynamics in response to therapy. These new discoveries may have significant implications for understanding, monitoring, and treating leukemia and other cancers.","['Copyright (c) 2017 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"BACKGROUND: In Alpharadin in Symptomatic Prostate Cancer (ALSYMPCA) trial, radium-223 versus placebo prolonged overall survival with favorable safety in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases. Long-term radium-223 monitoring underlies a comprehensive safety and risk/benefit assessment. OBJECTIVE: To report updated ALSYMPCA safety, including long-term safety up to 3 yr after the first injection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Safety analyses from phase 3 randomized ALSYMPCA trial included patients receiving >/=1 study-drug injection (600 radium-223 and 301 placebo). Patients (405 radium-223 and 167 placebo) entered long-term safety follow-up starting 12 wk after the last study-drug injection, to 3 yr from the first injection. Forty-eight of 405 (12%) radium-223 and 12/167 (7%) placebo patients completed follow-up, with evaluations every 2 mo for 6 mo, then every 4 mo until 3 yr. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: All adverse events (AEs) were collected until 12 wk after the last injection; subsequently, only treatment-related AEs were collected. Additional long-term safety was assessed by development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aplastic anemia, and secondary malignancies. Data analysis used descriptive statistics. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: During treatment to 12 wk following the last injection, 564/600 (94%) radium-223 and 292/301 (97%) placebo patients had treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). Myelosuppression incidence was low. Grade 3/4 hematologic TEAEs in radium-223 and placebo groups were anemia (13% vs 13%), neutropenia (2% vs 1%), and thrombocytopenia (7% vs 2%). Ninety-eight of 600 (16%) radium-223 and 68/301 (23%) placebo patients experienced grade 5 TEAEs. Long-term follow-up showed no AML, MDS, or new primary bone cancer; secondary non-treatment-related malignancies occurred in four radium-223 and three placebo patients. One radium-223 patient had aplastic anemia 16 mo after the last injection. No other cases were observed. Limitations include short (3-yr) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Final long-term safety ALSYMPCA analysis shows that radium-223 remained well tolerated, with low myelosuppression incidence and no new safety concerns. PATIENT SUMMARY: Updated Alpharadin in Symptomatic Prostate Cancer (ALSYMPCA) trial findings show that radium-223 remained well tolerated during treatment and up to 3 yr after each patient's first injection.","['Copyright (c) 2017 European Association of Urology.

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"INTRODUCTION: Btk is a tyrosine kinase dysregulated in several B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases, and this has given rise to a search for Btk inhibitors. Nevertheless, only one Btk inhibitor, ibrutinib, has been approved to date, although other compounds are currently being evaluated in clinical trials or in preclinal stages. Area covered: This review, after a brief introduction on Btk and its inhibitors already in clinical trials, focusses on pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives patented in the last five years as Btk inhibitors. Indeed, the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold, being a deaza-isostere of adenine, the nitrogenous base of ATP, is an actively pursued target for Btk inhibitors. The patent literature since 2012 have been extensively investigated, pointing out the general features of the patented compounds and, when it is possible, their mechanism of action. Expert opinion: The recently patented pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines, acting as reversible or irreversible inhibitors, showed a very interesting in vitro activity. For this reason, the development of compounds endowed with this scaffold could afford a significant impact in the search for drug candidates for the treatment of immune diseases or B-cell malignancies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmune diseases', 'B-cell neoplasias', 'Btk', 'inhibitors', 'pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines', 'tyrosine kinases']",,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 5.,"A microfluidic structured-dual electrodes sensor comprising of a pair of screen printed carbon electrodes was fabricated to detect acetylcholine, where one of them was used for an enzyme reaction and another for a detection electrode. The former was coated with gold nanoparticles and the latter with a porous gold layer, followed by electropolymerization of 2, 2:5,2-terthiophene-3-(p-benzoic acid) (pTTBA) on both the electrodes. Then, acetylcholinesterase was covalently attached onto the reaction electrode, and hydrazine and choline oxidase were co-immobilized on the detection electrode. The layers of both modified electrodes were characterized employing voltammetry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and quartz crystal microscopy. After the modifications of both electrode surfaces, they were precisely faced each other to form a microfluidic channel structure, where H2O2 produced from the sequential enzymatic reactions was reduced by hydrazine to obtain the analytical signal which was analyzed by the detection electrode. The microfluidic sensor at the optimized experimental conditions exhibited a wide dynamic range from 0.7nM to 1500muM with the detection limit of 0.6 +/- 0.1nM based on 3s (S/N = 3). The biomedical application of the proposed sensor was evaluated by detecting acetylcholine in human plasma samples. Moreover, the Ca(2+)-induced acetylcholine released in leukemic T-cells was also investigated to show the in vitro detection ability of the designed microfluidic sensor. Interference due to the real component matrix were also studied and long term stability of the designed sensor was evaluated. The analytical performance of the designed sensor was also compared with commercially available ACh detection kit.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Analysis of the efficacy and toxicity results of pediatric DFCP vs. classic Hyper-CVAD protocol for the treatment of patients with ALL < 50 Y. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective single center comparative analysis of DFCP & classic Hyper-CVAD for first line treatment of patients with ALL < 50 Y. RESULTS: 73 patients were included, 43 received DFCP and 30 received Hyper-CVAD protocol. CR rate was 90.7% for DFCP vs. 83.7 for Hyper-CVAD (p 0.7). 3 Y Leukemia free survival was 57.4% (70.9% for DFCP vs. 41.6% Hyper-CVAD P 0.1) while 3Y OS was 62.6%% for the whole group, 72.6% DFCP vs. 48.5% Hyper-CVAD, P 0.04. Those with age <21 Y, had significantly longer 3 Y LFS and OS (P 0.04, 0.02, respectively). TOXICITY: pancreatitis occurred in 5 patients with DFCP and it was related to Asparginase and in 1 patient on Hyper-CVAD related to gall stones. Osteonecrosis affected 5 patients on DFCP. IN CONCLUSION: pediatric protocols are feasible in patients younger than 50 Y and they are more active than classic adult protocols. Although modifications of adult protocols may improve their results, this had to be investigated in randomized controlled trials.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared these measurements in a realistic cohort of 101 patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) using a simplified qPCR method, and confirmed the prognostic power of each in a competing risk analysis. Gene expression levels were measured in peripheral blood samples at diagnosis. The PTCH1/SMO ratio did not improve PTCH1 prognostic power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.71 vs. 0.72). In order to reduce the number of genes to be analyzed, PTCH1 was the selected measurement. High and low PTCH1 expression groups had significantly different cumulative incidences of imatinib failure (IF), which was defined as discontinuation of imatinib due to lack of efficacy (5% vs. 25% at 4 years, P = 0.013), probabilities of achieving a major molecular response (81% vs. 53% at first year, P = 0.02), and proportions of early molecular failure (14% vs. 43%, P = 0.015). Every progression to an advanced phase (n = 3) and CML-related death (n = 2) occurred in the low PTCH1 group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). PTCH1 was an independent prognostic factor for the prediction of IF. We also validated previously published thresholds for PTCH1 expression. Therefore, we confirmed that PTCH1 expression can predict the imatinib response in CML patients in CP by applying a more rigorous statistical analysis. Thus, PTCH1 expression is a promising molecular marker for predicting the imatinib response in CML patients in CP.",,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Patched-1 Receptor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",PMC5509313,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6233-5912'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XIAP is an inhibitor of apoptosis, mediating through its association with BIR3 domain of caspase 9. Embelin, a quinone derivative isolated from the Embelia ribes plant, has been shown to exhibit chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and apoptotic activities via inhibiting XIAP activity. In this study, we found that embelin causes a dose-dependent suppression of proliferation in leukemic cell lines K562 and U937. Embelin mediated inhibition of proliferation correlates with induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, embelin treatment causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, resulting in subsequent activation of caspase-3 followed by polyadenosin-5'-diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. In addition, embelin treatment of leukemic cells results in a decrease of constitutive phosphorylations/activation level of AKT and downregulation of XIAP. Gene silencing of XIAP and AKT expression showed a link between XIAP expression and activated AKT in leukemic cells.

In particular, we reported the existence of BCR-ABL alternative splicing isoforms, in about 80% of Philadelphia-positive patients, which lead to the expression of aberrant proteins. These fusion proteins are characterized by an orphan initial and correct Bcr portion attached to a 112 amino acid sequence, arising from the impairment in the reading frame (reading of ABL exon 4 and 5). We demonstrated that these Abl-out-of-frame (OOF) isoforms could have an immunological role with therapeutic implications. The aim of this study was to characterize a new monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for Abl-OOF protein portion, for diagnostic use, to detect this biomarker in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients and to generate novel approaches in the immunotherapy. 5F11G11 MAb recognizes the OOF protein portion of the native full-length Bcr/Abl-OOF protein expressed in cells transiently transfected, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. In addition, we demonstrate the MAb's ability to recognize the alternative hybrid Bcr/Abl fusion protein expressed in leukemic cells from CML patients, to support the possible use of 5F11G11 MAb as a diagnostic tool to select patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML that could be eligible for an immunotherapeutic approach with this new antigen.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL transcripts', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'monoclonal antibody', 'tumor-associated antigen']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steady-state autophagy was measured in leukemic cell lines and primary human CD34(+) AML cells with a large variability in basal autophagy between AMLs observed. The autophagy flux was higher in AMLs classified as poor risk, which are frequently associated with TP53 mutations (TP53(mut)), compared with favorable- and intermediate-risk AMLs. In addition, the higher flux was associated with a higher expression level of several autophagy genes, but was not affected by alterations in p53 expression by knocking down p53 or overexpression of wild-type p53 or p53(R273H). AML CD34(+) cells were more sensitive to the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) than normal bone marrow CD34(+) cells. Similar, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of ATG5 or ATG7 triggered apoptosis, which coincided with increased expression of p53. In contrast to wild-type p53 AML (TP53(wt)), HCQ treatment did not trigger a BAX and PUMA-dependent apoptotic response in AMLs harboring TP53(mut). To further characterize autophagy in the leukemic stem cell-enriched cell fraction AML CD34(+) cells were separated into ROS(low) and ROS(high) subfractions. The immature AML CD34(+)-enriched ROS(low) cells maintained higher basal autophagy and showed reduced survival upon HCQ treatment compared with ROS(high) cells. Finally, knockdown of ATG5 inhibits in vivo maintenance of AML CD34(+) cells in NSG mice. These results indicate that targeting autophagy might provide new therapeutic options for treatment of AML since it affects the immature AML subfraction.",,,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)']",PMC5550863,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8452-8555'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of the combination of TPD7 and berberine (TAB) on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell growth. TPD7 and berberine together synergistically inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells. Also, the combination of TAB induced G1 -phase cell-cycle arrest by downregulating the level of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDC2. Furthermore, the combination of TAB significantly enhanced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, and the apoptosis most likely resulted from the modulation of the level of Bcl-2 family members. Most importantly, the concomitant treatment simultaneously regulated the ephrin-B2 and VEGFR2 signaling, as well as modulated the MEK/ERK and PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Therefore, the combination treatment of TAB may be a promising therapeutic method in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"In this review, we discuss the intricate roles of the Wnt signalling network in the development and progression of mature B-cell-derived haematological malignancies, with a focus on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and related B-cell lymphomas. We review the current literature and highlight the differences between the beta-catenin-dependent and -independent branches of Wnt signalling. Special attention is paid to the role of the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, mediated by the Wnt-5-receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR1)-Dishevelled signalling axis in CLL. This is mainly because the Wnt/PCP co-receptor ROR1 was found to be overexpressed in CLL and the Wnt/PCP pathway contributes to numerous aspects of CLL pathogenesis. We also discuss the possibilities of therapeutically targeting the Wnt signalling pathways as an approach to disrupt the crucial interaction between malignant cells and their micro-environment. We also advocate the need for research in this direction for other lymphomas, namely, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and follicular lymphoma where the Wnt signalling pathway probably plays a similar role.

Most patients (58%) received anthracycline-cytarabine-based regimens (ACBRs), which were associated with significantly increased complete remission (CR: 91%). Yet, the maternal overall survival (OS: approximately 30%) was relatively low, probably reflecting reduced application of risk-adapted consolidation and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Fetal exposure to ACBRs resulted in a live birth rate of 87%, with complications (16%) diagnosed only in chemotherapy-subjected neonates. This study demonstrates safety and efficacy of ACBRs during pregnancy. Therapy and delivery schedule should allow early referral of high-risk patients to allo-SCT.

It is acquired in early childhood and remains life-long latent in the genitourinary system. BK virus replication is more common in receiving immunosuppressive therapy receiving patients and transplant patients. BK virus could cause hemorrhagic cystitis in patients with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Hemorrhagic cystitis is a serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Hemorrhagic cystitis could cause morbidity and long stay in the hospital. Diagnosis is more frequently determined by the presence of BK virus DNA detected with quantitative or real-time PCR testing in serum or plasma and less often in urine. The reduction of immunosuppression is effective in the treatment of BK virus infection. There are also several agents with anti-BK virus activity. Cidofovir is an active agent against a variety of DNA viruses including poliomyoma viruses and it is a cytosine nucleotide analogue. Intravenous immunoglobulin IgG (IVIG) also includes antibodies against BK and JC (John Cunningham) viruses. Hereby, we report three cases of hemorrhagic cystitis. Hemorrhagic cystitis developed in all these three cases of allogeneic stem cell transplantation due to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BK virus were detected as the cause of hemorrhagic cystitis in these patients. Irrigation of the bladder was performed. Then levofloxacin 1 x750 mg intravenous and IVIG 0.5 gr/kg were started. But the hematuria did not decreased. In the first case, treatment with leflunomide was started, but patient died due to refractory AML and severe graft-versus-host disease after 4th day of leflunamide and levofloxacin treatments. Cidofovir treatment and the reduction of immunosuppressive treatment decreased the BK virus load and resulted symptomatic improvement in the second case. Initiation of cidofovir was planned in the third case. Administration of cidofovir together with the reduction of immunosuppression in the treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis associated with BK virus in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients could be a good option.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BK virus', 'hemorrhagic cystitis', 'leukemia']",,,PMC5494446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently developed an approach, termed pathology tissue analysis of histones by mass spectrometry (PAT-H-MS), that allows performing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of histone PTMs from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pathology samples. Despite its great potential, the application of this technique is limited by tissue heterogeneity. METHODS: In this study, we further implemented the PAT-H-MS approach by coupling it with techniques aimed at reducing sample heterogeneity and selecting specific portions or cell populations within the samples, such as manual macrodissection and laser microdissection (LMD). RESULTS: When applied to the analysis of a small set of breast cancer samples, LMD-PAT-H-MS allowed detecting more marked changes between luminal A-like and triple negative patients as compared with the classical approach. These changes included not only the already known H3 K27me3 and K9me3 marks, but also H3 K36me1, which was found increased in triple negative samples and validated on a larger cohort of patients, and could represent a potential novel marker distinguishing breast cancer subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of applying techniques to reduce sample heterogeneity, including laser microdissection, to the PAT-H-MS protocol, providing new tools in clinical epigenetics and opening new avenues for the comprehensive analysis of histone post-translational modifications in selected cell populations.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetic marker', '*Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded', '*Histone post-translational modifications', '*Laser microdissection', '*Mass spectrometry', '*PAT-H-MS', '*Proteomics']",,['0 (Histones)'],PMC5504751,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3556-1265'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study compared dental caries, oral hygiene status, salivary pH, and Streptococcus mutans counts in dental plaques and saliva of children with leukemia with those of healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control cross-sectional study assessed 32 children with ALL and 32 healthy children (4-9-year-old) for gingival bleeding index (GBI), decayed, missing, and filled/decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (DMF/dmfs), and plaque index (PI). Sampling was performed to determine salivary pH and S. mutans counts of the participants. The two groups matched in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic status. The groups were compared using independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test, and Spearman's and Pearson's correlation analyses. RESULTS: The mean DMF/dmfs and GBI were significantly higher in the ALL group (PDMF/dmfs= 0.03; PGBI= 0.04). However, the two groups were not significantly different in the mean PI values (P = 0.47). The mean S. mutans counts in dental plaques and saliva of the children with leukemia were significantly lower than the healthy controls (P < 0.01). Moreover, the mean salivary pH was significantly lower in the ALL group compared to the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Higher caries and gingival bleeding rates, higher dental plaque accumulation in children with ALL, decreased salivary pH, and cumulative effects of other risk factors highlight the significance of oral hygiene training programs (for the parents of these children) and regular dental examinations for these children.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'caries', 'children', 'dental plaque', 'gingival health']",,,PMC5504871,,,,,,"['The authors of this manuscript declare that they have no conflicts of interest,', 'real or perceived, financial or nonfinancial in this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 13.,"Chromosomal rearrangements of the human MLL/KMT2A gene are associated with infant, pediatric, adult and therapy-induced acute leukemias. Here we present the data obtained from 2345 acute leukemia patients. Genomic breakpoints within the MLL gene and the involved translocation partner genes (TPGs) were determined and 11 novel TPGs were identified. Thus, a total of 135 different MLL rearrangements have been identified so far, of which 94 TPGs are now characterized at the molecular level. In all, 35 out of these 94 TPGs occur recurrently, but only 9 specific gene fusions account for more than 90% of all illegitimate recombinations of the MLL gene. We observed an age-dependent breakpoint shift with breakpoints localizing within MLL intron 11 associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and younger patients, while breakpoints in MLL intron 9 predominate in AML or older patients. The molecular characterization of MLL breakpoints suggests different etiologies in the different age groups and allows the correlation of functional domains of the MLL gene with clinical outcome. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the MLL recombinome in acute leukemia and demonstrates that the establishment of patient-specific chromosomal fusion sites allows the design of specific PCR primers for minimal residual disease analyses for all patients.",,,,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",PMC5808070,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4843-2876', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0188-6005', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5404-6483', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4870-3445']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explored the molecular mechanism underlying the growth defect found in Asxl1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We found that Asxl1, through amino acids 371 to 655, interacts with the kinase domain of AKT1. In Asxl1-null MEFs, IGF-1 was unable to induce AKT1 phosphorylation and activation; p27Kip1, which forms a ternary complex with ASXL1 and AKT1, therefore remained unphosphorylated. Hypophosphorylated p27Kip1 is able to enter the nucleus, where it prevents the phosphorylation of Rb; this ultimately leads to the down-regulation of E2F target genes as confirmed by microarray analysis. We also found that senescence-associated (SA) genes were upregulated and that SA beta-gal staining was increased in Asxl1 (-/-) MEFs. Further, the treatment of an AKT inhibitor not only stimulated nuclear accumulation of p27Kip1 leading to E2F inactivation, but also promoted senescence. Finally, Asxl1 disruption augmented the expression of p16Ink4a as result of the defect in Asxl1-Ezh2 cooperation. Overall, our study provides the first evidence that Asxl1 both activates the AKT-E2F pathway and cooperates with Ezh2 through direct interactions at early embryonic stages, reflecting that Asxl1 disruption causes cellular senescence.",,,,,"['0 (Asxl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",PMC5507898,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used in the clinical management of hematological neoplasms. Moreover, in solid tumors such as stage 4 neuroblastomas (NB), imatinib showed benefits that might depend on both on-target and immunological off-target effects. We investigated the effects of imatinib and nilotinib on human NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages. High numbers of monocytes died upon exposure to TKI concentrations similar to those achieved in patients. Conversely, NK cells were highly resistant to the TKI cytotoxic effect, were properly activated by immunostimulatory cytokines, and degranulated in the presence of NB cells. In NB, neither drug reduced the expression of ligands for activating NK receptors or upregulated that of HLA class I, B7-H3, PD-L1, and PD-L2, molecules that might limit NK cell function. Interestingly, TKIs modulated the chemokine receptor repertoire of immune cells. Acting at the transcriptional level, they increased the surface expression of CXCR4, an effect observed also in NK cells and monocytes of patients receiving imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia. Moreover, TKIs reduced the expression of CXCR3 (in NK cells) and CCR1 (in monocytes). Monocytes also decreased the expression of M-CSFR, and low numbers of cells underwent differentiation toward macrophages. M0 and M2 macrophages were highly resistant to TKIs and maintained their phenotypic and functional characteristics. Importantly, also in the presence of TKIs, the M2 immunosuppressive polarization was reverted by TLR engagement, and M1-oriented macrophages fully activated autologous NK cells. Our results contribute to better interpreting the off-target efficacy of TKIs in tumors and to envisaging strategies aimed at facilitating antitumor immune responses.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CCR1 protein, human)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1932-0608', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7316-0772', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5676-6000', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6984-8817', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6695-1739', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2806-1115']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"Western blotting (WB) for human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is performed to confirm anti-HTLV-1 antibodies detected at the initial screening of blood donors and in pregnant women. However, the frequent occurrence of indeterminate results is a problem with this test. We therefore assessed the cause of indeterminate WB results by analyzing HTLV-1 provirus genomic sequences. A quantitative PCR assay measuring HTLV-1 provirus in WB-indeterminate samples revealed that the median proviral load was approximately 100-fold lower than that of WB-positive samples (0.01 versus 0.71 copy/100 cells). Phylogenic analysis of the complete HTLV-1 genomes of WB-indeterminate samples did not identify any specific phylogenetic groups. When we analyzed the nucleotide changes in 19 HTLV-1 isolates from WB-indeterminate samples, we identified 135 single nucleotide substitutions, composed of four types, G to A (29%), C to T (19%), T to C (19%), and A to G (16%). In the most frequent G-to-A substitution, 64% occurred at GG dinucleotides, indicating that APOBEC3G is responsible for mutagenesis in WB-indeterminate samples. Moreover, interestingly, five WB-indeterminate isolates had nonsense mutations in Pol and/or Tax, Env, p12, and p30. These findings suggest that WB-indeterminate carriers have low production of viral antigens because of a combination of a low proviral load and mutations in the provirus, which may interfere with host recognition of HTLV-1 antigens.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Western blot indeterminate', '*human T cell leukemia virus', '*nonsense mutation', '*nucleic acid technology', '*nucleotide substitution', '*proviral load', '*provirus']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)']",PMC5648719,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3064-5219'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 13.,"BACKGROUND: The use of chemotherapeutics during pregnancy is a dilemma for both the patient and the clinician. We report here our 11 years' experience with the use of chemotherapy during pregnancy. PATIENTS: 13 patients undergoing chemotherapy during their current pregnancy were evaluated. The medical data of 5 patients with hematologic malignancies (2 Hodgkin's, 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 1 chronic myeloid leukemia), 6 patients with breast cancer, 1 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, and 1 patient with choriocarcinoma were retrospectively obtained from the 'perinatal database' of Hacettepe University for the period of January 2002 through March 2016. RESULTS: 4 patients had a medical termination due to teratologic effects. 4 patients had a vaginal delivery, and 5 patients delivered by caesarean section. The 9 newborns who had been exposed to chemotherapeutics were free of congenital anomalies. However, 1 of them died in the early neonatal period due to multi-organ failure (nasopharyngeal cancer). During the 2-year follow-up, we encountered 1 maternal mortality, which was due to multi-organ failure in a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient. CONCLUSION: Physicians must pay attention to potential teratologic problems, and should carefully balance maternal and fetal risks. Selected chemotherapeutic agents can be given in the 2nd and 3rd trimester without any major teratogenic risk.

Since GBM cells and neuroblasts use the same migratory routes, mechanisms underlying migration during neurogenesis and brain cancer pathogenesis may be similar. Here, we identify a common pathway controlling cell migration in normal and neoplastic cells in the CNS. The nuclear scaffold protein promyelocytic leukemia (PML), a regulator of forebrain development, promotes neural progenitor/stem cell (NPC) and neuroblast migration in the adult mouse brain. The PML pro-migratory role is active also in transformed mouse NPCs and in human primary GBM cells. In both normal and neoplastic settings, PML controls cell migration via Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated repression of Slits, key regulators of axon guidance. Finally, a PML/SLIT1 axis regulates sensitivity to the PML-targeting drug arsenic trioxide in primary GBM cells. Taken together, these findings uncover a drug-targetable molecular axis controlling cell migration in both normal and neoplastic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We developed a microfabricated channel system that linearizes mammalian cell growth and facilitates cell size measurements. By tracking cell length, while directly visualizing cell-cycle progression in rat basophilic leukemia cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages, we examined the mechanisms of size homeostasis and the existence of a size checkpoint at the G1/S transition.

Epub 2017 Jul 9.,"Success of cancer treatment is often hampered by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/Pgp). Doxorubicin (DOX) is recognized by Pgp and therefore it can induce therapy resistance in breast cancer patients. In this study our aim was to evaluate the susceptibility of the pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (PLD/Doxil(R)/Caelyx(R)) to MDR. We show that cells selected to be resistant to DOX are cross-resistant to PLD and PLD is also ineffective in an allograft model of doxorubicin-resistant mouse B-cell leukemia. In contrast, PLD was far more efficient than DOX as reflected by a significant increase of both relapse-free and overall survival of Brca1(-/-);p53(-/-) mammary tumor bearing mice. Increased survival could be explained by the delayed onset of drug resistance. Consistent with the higher Pgp levels needed to confer resistance, PLD administration was able to overcome doxorubicin insensitivity of the mouse mammary tumors. Our results indicate that the favorable pharmacokinetics achieved with PLD can effectively overcome Pgp-mediated resistance, suggesting that PLD therapy could be a promising strategy for the treatment of therapy-resistant breast cancer patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with a terminal illness should have access to their chosen location of death. Cancer is the leading cause of non-accidental death among adolescents and young adults (AYAs; those aged 15-39 years). Although surveys have suggested that a majority of these patients prefer a home death, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding their barriers to accessing their preferred location of death. As a first step, the authors sought to determine, across a large population, 20-year trends in the location of death among AYA patients with cancer. METHODS: Using the Vital Statistics Death Certificate Database of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the authors performed a retrospective, population-based analysis of California patients with cancer aged 15 to 39 years who died between 1989 and 2011. Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with hospital death were examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 30,573 AYA oncology decedents, 57% died in a hospital, 33% died at home, and 10% died in other locations (eg, hospice facility or nursing facility). Between 1989 and 1994, hospital death rates decreased from 68.3% to 53.6% and at-home death rates increased from 16.8% to 35.5%. Between 1995 and 2011, these rates were stable. Those individuals who were more likely to die in a hospital were those aged <30 years, of minority race, of Hispanic ethnicity, who lived </=10 miles from a specialty center, and who had a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the majority of AYA cancer deaths occurred in a hospital, with a 5-year shift to more in-home deaths that abated after 1995. In-hospital deaths were more common among younger patients, patients of minority race/ethnicities, and those with a leukemia or lymphoma diagnosis. Further study is needed to determine whether these rates and disparities are consistent with patient preferences. Cancer 2017;123:4178-4184.

To compare the efficacy and safety of MCFG and triazoles in the prevention and treatment of IFIs, we conducted a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). METHODS: For the meta-analysis, we systematically searched the databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and relevant database articles for randomized controlled studies published through November 2016. Comparative studies of the efficacy and safety of MCFG versus triazoles in the prevention and treatment of IFIs were selected. Meta-analysis was performed by R software with the ""metafor"" package. Pooled results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). TSA was adopted to assess the studies' power with TSA version 0.9 beta. RESULTS: Nine current studies were included in the meta-analysis (1049 cases and 959 controls). Pooled trial comparisons indicated that MCFG does have significantly higher treatment success rates (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25; p = 0.0205) and reduces the number of overall IFIs (RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; p = 0.0056). However, MCFG demonstrates no difference in all-cause mortality (RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.52-1.12, p = 0.1624). For the safety evaluation, MCFG had a significantly lower incidence of severe adverse events (AEs) (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83; p = 0.0105), hepatic impairment (RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.97; p = 0.0363) and premature discontinuation (RR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76, p = 0.0010). Meta-regression analysis disclosed the correction of mean age and treatment success rates (P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, TSA demonstrated sufficient power to show efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment success rate of MCFG is superior to that of triazoles for the prophylaxis and treatment of IFIs, and correction of the mean patient age demonstrates that efficacy increases as patient age decreases.

Lifelong less than 10% of carriers develop life-threatening diseases, mostly a subacute myelopathy known as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and a lymphoproliferative disorder named adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). HTLV-1 is efficiently transmitted perinatally (breastfeeding), sexually (more from men to women) and parenterally (transfusions, injection drug user (IDU), and transplants). To date there is neither prophylactic vaccine nor effective antiviral therapy. A total of 327 cases of HTLV-1 infection had been reported at the HTLV-1 Spanish registry until December 2016, of whom 34 had been diagnosed with TSP and 25 with ATL. Overall 62% were Latin American immigrants and 13% were persons of African origin. The incidence of HTLV-1 in Spain has remained stable for nearly a decade with 20-25 new cases yearly. Of the 21 newly diagnosed HTLV-1 cases during year 2016, one was a native Spaniard pregnant woman, and four presented with symptomatic disease, including three with ATL and one with TSP. Underdiagnosis of HTLV-1 in Spain must be high (iceberg model), which may account for the disproportionate high rate of symptomatic cases (almost 20%) and the late recognition of preventable HTLV-1 transmissions in special populations, such as newborns and transplant recipients. Our current estimate is of 10 000 persons living with HTLV-1 infection in Spain. Given the large flux of immigrants and visitors from HTLV-1 endemic regions to Spain, the expansion of HTLV-1 screening policies is warranted. At this time, it seems worth recommending HTLV testing to all donor/recipient organ transplants and pregnant women regardless place of birth. Although current leukoreduction procedures largely prevent HTLV-1 transmission by blood transfusions, HTLV testing of all first-time donors should be cost-effective contributing to unveil asymptomatic unaware HTLV-1 carriers.",,,,,,,,,,['Spanish HTLV Network'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective case notes review with fundal photographs. RESULTS: In this case, on initial presentation and on recurrence, the patient's serum anti-Toxoplasma IgG remained negative. The diagnosis was made on quantitative PCR of vitreous initially and aqueous humor on reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite negative serology, one must still consider ocular toxoplasmosis especially in CLL patients where the clinical picture could be compatible. Hypogammaglobulinaemia, the inability to produce IgG antibodies, is a well-recognized complication of CLL. Intraocular fluid sampling is essential in these cases where the sensitivity of PCR on either aqueous or vitreous humor has been shown to be higher in immunocompromised patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['PCR', 'Toxoplasma chorioretinitis', 'false negative', 'hypogammaglobulinaemia', 'serology']",,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Protozoan)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'GCU97FKN3R (Valganciclovir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated three different inhaled cigarette smoke doses over five different exposure durations to identify how the testis is affected. The effects of cigarette smoke exposure on testicular germ cells were characterized by morphological changes and a significant elevation in the number of apoptotic cells. Caspase 3 activation increased dramatically after cigarette smoke exposure, accompanied by significant time-dependent expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak (B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 [Bcl-2] homologous antagonist killer), Bcl2l11 (a BH3 domain-only protein related to Bcl-2), Apaf1 (Apoptotic protease-activating factor-1), and Caspase 9. Conversely, the abundance of anti-apoptotic Bcl2l2 decreased. Taken together, our findings suggest that extensive inhalation of cigarette smoke damages testicular germ cells through the induction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through the Bcl-2 protein family.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['animal model', 'cigarette smoking', 'mitochondrial apoptotic pathway', 'molecular mechanism', 'testes']",,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3757-6559'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, available information on anticancer activity of hydantoin derivatives is still scarce. Here, we evaluated possible antileukemic potential of four phenytoin analogs, namely: methyl 2-(2,4-dioxo-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-3-yl)propanoate (1), methyl 2-(1-(3-bromopropyl)-2,4-dioxo-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-3-yl)propanoate (2), 1-(3-bromopropyl)-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (3) and 1-(3-bromobutyl)-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (4). The experiments were performed on human acute histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells and human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. The present study was conducted using spectrophotometric 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the electronic Beckman-Coulter method. We observed temporary changes in the leukemia cell viability, volume and count. The effects of the four 5,5-diphenylhydantoin derivatives on U937 and HL-60 cells depended on the agent tested and its concentration, the time intervals after the compound application, and the leukemia cell line used. HL-60 cells were more sensitive than U937 cells to the action of the phenytoin analogs (1-4). The antileukemic activities of the three bromoalkyl diphenylhydantoin derivatives (2, 3, and 4) were stronger than that of the compound 1 [methyl 2-(2,4-dioxo-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-3-yl) propanoate], with no bromoalkyl substituent. The structural modifications of 5,5-diphenylhydantoin are responsible for such varied antileukemic potential of its four derivatives.",,,,,['6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions between 67LR and laminin play a major role in mediating cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival. 67LR derives from homo- or hetero-dimerization of a 37 kDa cytosolic precursor (37LRP), most probably by fatty acid acylation. Interestingly, 37LRP, also called p40 or OFA/iLR (oncofetal antigen/immature laminin receptor), is a multifunctional protein with a dual activity in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, 37LRP it is associated with the 40S subunit of ribosome, playing a critical role in protein translation and ribosome biogenesis while in the nucleus it is tightly associated with nuclear structures, and bound to components of the cytoskeleton, such as tubulin and actin. 67LR is mainly localized in the cell membrane, concentrated in lipid rafts. Acting as a receptor for laminin is not the only function of 67LR; indeed, it also acts as a receptor for viruses, bacteria and prions. 67LR expression is increased in neoplastic cells and correlates with an enhanced invasive and metastatic potential. The primary function of 67LR in cancer is to promote tumor cell adhesion to basement membranes, the first step in the invasion-metastasis cascade. Thus, 67LR is overexpressed in neoplastic cells as compared to their normal counterparts and its overexpression is considered a molecular marker of metastatic aggressiveness in cancer of many tissues, including breast, lung, ovary, prostate, stomach, thyroid and also in leukemia and lymphoma. Thus, inhibiting 67LR binding to laminin could be a feasible approach to block cancer progression. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure and function of this molecule, highlighting its role in cancer invasion and metastasis and reviewing the various therapeutic options targeting this receptor that could have a promising future application.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Laminin receptor', '*laminin', '*leukemia', '*metastasis', '*monoclonal antibody', '*small molecule']",,"['0 (Receptors, Laminin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty nine elderly patients with de novo AML (median age 69.9 years) who achieved complete remission (CR) after induction-chemotherapy were analyzed. To examine the effect of pegfilgrastim on neutropenia and hospitalization, we compared cycles 2 and 4 where pegfilgrastim was given routinely from day 6 (IDAC-P) with cycle 3 where pegfilgrastim was only administered in case of severe infections and/or prolonged neutropenia. All four planned cycles were administered in 23/39 patients (59.0%); 5/39 patients (12.8%) received 3 cycles, 3/39 (7.7%) 2 cycles, and 8/39 (20.5%) one consolidation-cycle. The median duration of severe neutropenia was 7 days in cycle 2 (IDAC-P), 11.5 days in cycle 3 (IDAC), and 7.5 days in cycle 4 (IDAC-P) (P < .05). Median overall survival was 1.1 years and differed significantly between patients aged <75 and >/=75 years (P < .05). The probability to be alive after 5 years was 32%. Together, intensified consolidation can be administered in AML patients >/=60, and those who are <75 may benefit from this therapy. Routine administration of pegfilgrastim during consolidation shortens the time of neutropenia and hospitalization in these patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['F 4704/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A58010674 (pegfilgrastim)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",PMC7115890,['EMS87361'],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3288-8027'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present the outcomes of a large cohort of patients with PV included in the European Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin (ECLAP) study. We selected 1,042 patients who, during the follow-up, had received only phlebotomy (PHL) or HU to maintain the hematocrit level < 45%. To assure comparability, we conducted a propensity score matching analysis. The two groups (PHL n = 342 and HU n = 681) were well balanced for the parameters included in the propensity score (overall balance: chi(2) = 2.44, P = 0.964). Over a comparable period of follow-up (PHL = 29.9 vs. HU = 34.7 months), we documented an advantage of HU over PHL consistently significant with respect to the incidence of fatal/non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events (5.8 vs. 3.0 per 100 person-years in PHL vs. HU group, P = 0.002) and myelofibrosis transformation that was only experienced by patients of PHL group. Evolution to acute leukemia was registered in three patients (two in PHL and one in HU group). The excess of mortality and total CV events in the PHL patients was restricted to the high-risk group, and, compared with HU cases, was significant higher in the PHL patients who failed to reach the hematocrit target < 0.45% (P = 0.000). In conclusion, this analysis provides reliable and qualified estimates of the therapeutic profile of HU and PHL treatments for future experimental studies and for the management of PV in clinical practice.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2747-6327'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"The ability of NK cells to specifically recognize cells lacking expression of self-MHC class I molecules was discovered over 30 years ago. It provided the foundation for the ""missing self"" hypothesis. Research in the two past decades has contributed to a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that determine the specificity and strength of NK cell-mediated ""missing self"" responses to tumor cells. However, in light of the recent remarkable breakthroughs in clinical cancer immunotherapy, the cytolytic potential of NK cells still remains largely untapped in clinical settings. There is abundant evidence demonstrating partial or complete loss of HLA class I expression in a wide spectrum of human tumor types. Such loss may result from immune selection of escape variants by tumor-specific CD8 T cells and has more recently also been linked to acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibition therapy. In the present review, we discuss the early predictions of the ""missing self"" hypothesis, its molecular basis and outline the potential for NK cell-based adoptive immunotherapy to convert checkpoint inhibitor therapy-resistant patients into clinical responders.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Differentiation', '*Education', '*HLA', '*Immune escape', '*Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR)', '*Leukemia', '*MHC class I', '*Missing self', '*Natural killer (NK) cell', '*Tumor']",,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",PMC5537320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite increased efficacy and better clinical responses over cytotoxic chemotherapies, many patients receiving targeted drugs exhibit a poor initial response, develop drug resistance, or undergo relapse after initial success. This inter-individual variation in response has heightened the interest in studying pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics (PGx) of cancer drugs. In this review, we discuss the influence of various germline and somatic factors on targeted drug response in CML. Specifically, we examine the role of genetic variants in drug metabolism genes, i.e. CYP3A family genes, and drug transporters, i.e. ABC and SLC family genes. Additionally, we focus on acquired somatic variations in BCR-ABL1, and the potential role played by additional downstream signaling pathways, in conferring resistance to targeted drugs in CML.

It reflects a balanced reciprocal translocation between long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 involving BCR and ABL1 genes, respectively. An accurate and reliable detection of BCR-ABL fusion gene is necessary for the diagnosis and monitoring of CML. Previously, many technologies, most of which are laborious and time consuming, have been developed to detect BCR-ABL chimeric gene or chromosome. METHODS: A new flow cytometric immunobead assay was used for detection of BCR-ABL fusion proteins and applicability, sensitivity, reliability, efficacy and rapidity of this method was evaluated. RESULTS: From February 2009 to January 2014, a total 648 CML patients were investigated for the status of BCR-ABL1 protein. Among them, 83 patients were enrolled for comparative study of BCR-ABL1 positivity by three routinely used procedures like karyotyping, and quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) as well as immunobead flow cytometry assay. BCR-ABL protein analysis was found consistent, more sensitive (17% greater sensitivity) and reliable than the conventional cytogenetics, as flow cytometry showed 95% concordance rate to RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: BCR-ABL fusion protein assay using a new flow cytometric immunobead might be useful in the diagnosis and monitoring CML patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Philadelphia chromosome']",,,PMC5503888,,,,,,"[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 biomarkers trans-activator x (TAX) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) are main oncogenes and life-threatening elements. This study aimed to assess the role of the TAX and HBZ genes and HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in the survival of patients with ATLL. METHODS: Forty-three HTLV-1-infected individuals, including 18 asymptomatic carriers (AC) and 25 ATLL patients (ATLL), were evaluated between 2011 and 2015. The mRNA expression of TAX and HBZ and the HTLV-1 PVL were measured by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Significant differences in the mean expression levels of TAX and HBZ were observed between the two study groups (ATLL and AC, P=0.014 and P=0.000, respectively). In addition, the ATLL group showed a significantly higher PVL than AC (P=0.000). There was a significant negative relationship between PVL and survival among all study groups (P=0.047). CONCLUSION: The HTLV-1 PVL and expression of TAX and HBZ were higher in the ATLL group than in the AC group. Moreover, a higher PVL was associated with shorter survival time among all ATLL subjects. Therefore, measurement of PVL, TAX, and HBZ may be beneficial for monitoring and predicting HTLV-1-infection outcomes, and PVL may be useful for prognosis assessment of ATLL patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of Korean children with iAMP21. METHODS: The cytogenetic data from BCP-ALL children were reviewed. The ETV6/RUNX1 ES Dual Color Probe was used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: In total, 295 children were included. Of these, 10 patients (3.4%) had iAMP21. The median age of iAMP21 patients was 9 years, and the median value of white blood cell count was 5.09x10(9)/L. Slow early treatment response was observed more in iAMP21 patients. Patients with iAMP21 had a higher incidence of relapse and worse survival rates. In patients with iAMP21, the estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 53.3%. The estimated 10-year event-free survival and overall survival rate were 46.7% and 64.8%, respectively. Most cases of leukemic relapse developed in the late period (median, 43 mo). In multivariate analysis, high risk group was the only factor that had a significant impact on death.

In the Lazio Region, data from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MDS, treated by a hematology center, have been collected since 2002 by the Gruppo Romano-Laziale Mielodisplasie (GROM-L) registry, the second MDS registry existing in Italy. This study aimed at evaluating MDS medical miscoding during hospitalizations, and patients' survival. For these purposes, we selected 644 MDS patients enrolled in the GROM-L registry. This cohort was linked with two regional health information systems: the Hospital Information System (HIS) and the Mortality Information System (MIS) in the 2002-2012 period. Of the 442 patients who were hospitalized at least once during the study period, 92% had up to 12 hospitalizations. 28.5% of patients had no hospitalization episodes scored like MDS, code 238.7 of the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The rate of death during a median follow-up of 46 months (range 0.9-130) was 45.5%. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the first cause of mortality, interestingly a relevant portion of deaths is due to cerebro-cardiovascular events and second tumors. This study highlights that MDS diagnosis and treatment, which require considerable healthcare resources, tend to be under-documented in the HIS archive. Thus we need to improve the HIS to better identify information on MDS hospitalizations and outcome. Moreover, we underline the importance of comorbidity in MDS patients' survival.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Epidemiology', 'Medical miscoding', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,PMC5499502,,,,,,['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this AML subtype, defined as low-blast count AML (LBC-AML, with 20-30% BM-blasts) is characterized by peculiar features, as increased frequency in elderly individuals and after cytotoxic treatment for a different primary disease (therapy-related), poor-risk cytogenetics, lower white blood cell counts, and less frequent mutations of NPM1 and FLT3 genes. The clinical course of this entity is often similar to MDS with 10-19% BM-blasts. The hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine have been shown to induce responses and prolong survival both in MDS and LBC-AML. The role of these agents has also been demonstrated in AML with >30% BM-blasts, particularly in patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and in AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Most recent studies are evaluating strategies to improve outcome, including combinations of hypomethylating agents with immune-response checkpoint inhibitors, which have a role in cancer immune surveillance.

AIM: The aim of our study was to analyse factors that influence hematopoietic recovery after autologous HSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse factors affecting neutrophil and platelet engraftment in 90 autologous transplanted patients - 30 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 30 with lymphoma and 30 with multiple myeloma (MM) from 2008 till 2016. RESULTS: The neutrophil recovery in AML patients was significantly influenced by transfusion support with random-donor platelets, sex and number of transplanted mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD34+ cells; and in lymphoma patients, it was influenced by sex, age, mobilisation strategy and some transplanted MNC. The influence of investigated factors on neutrophil engraftment in MM patients was not statistically significant. The platelet recovery in AML patients was influenced by transfusion support with random-donor platelets; in lymphoma patients, it was influenced by sex, age, time from diagnosis to harvesting and time from diagnosis to HSCT; and in MM patients it was influenced by transfusion support with random-donor platelets. CONCLUSION: Additional studies are necessary to better understanding of engraftment kinetic to improve the safety of HSCT and to minimise potential complications and expenses related to HSCT.",,['NOTNLM'],"['autologous stem cell transplantation', 'engraftment', 'hematopoietic recovery', 'peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells']",,,PMC5503731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"Antibody therapy constitutes a major advance in the treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). To evaluate the efficacy and the mechanisms of action of CD19 monoclonal antibody therapy in pediatric BCP-ALL, we tested an Fc-engineered CD19 antibody carrying the S239D/I332E mutation for improved effector cell recruitment (CD19-DE). Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of pediatric mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL)-rearranged ALL were established in NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mice. Antibody CD19-DE was efficient in prolonging the survival of NSG mice in a minimal residual disease (MRD) model. The majority of surviving mice remained polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-MRD negative after treatment. When antibody therapy was initiated in overt leukemia, antibody CD19-DE was still efficient in prolonging survival of xenografted mice in comparison with nontreated control animals, but the effects were less pronounced than in the MRD setting. Importantly, the combination of antibody CD19-DE and cytoreduction by chemotherapy (dexamethasone, vincristine, PEG-asparaginase) resulted in significantly improved survival rates in xenografted mice. Antibody CD19-DE treatment was also efficient in a randomized phase 2-like PDX trial using 13 MLL-rearranged BCP-ALL samples. Macrophage depletion by liposomal clodronate resulted in a reversal of the beneficial effects of CD19-DE, suggesting an important role for macrophages as effector cells. In support of this finding, CD19-DE was found to enhance phagocytosis of patient-derived ALL blasts by human macrophages in vitro. Thus, Fc-engineered CD19 antibodies may represent a promising treatment option for infants and children with MLL-rearranged BCP-ALL who have a poor outcome when treated with chemotherapy only.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)']",,,,,,['Blood. 2017 Sep 28;130(13):1487-1488.

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"RATIONALE: Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) includes an extracellular epidermal growth factor-like domain and an intracellular domain (NRG-1-ICD). In response to transforming growth factor-beta1, its cleavage by proteolytic enzymes releases a bioactive fragment, which suppresses the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by activating ErbB (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog) receptor. However, NRG-1-ICD function in VSMCs remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Here, we characterize the function of NRG-1-ICD and underlying mechanisms in VSMCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that NRG-1 was expressed in rat, mouse, and human VSMCs and was upregulated and cleaved in response to transforming growth factor-beta1. In the cytoplasm of HASMCs (human aortic smooth muscle cells), the NRG-1-ICD participated in filamentous actin formation by interacting with alpha-SMA (smooth muscle alpha-actin). In the nucleus, the Nrg-1-ICD induced circular ACTA2 (alpha-actin-2; circACTA2) formation by recruitment of the zinc-finger transcription factor IKZF1 (IKAROS family zinc finger 1) to the first intron of alpha-SMA gene. We further confirmed that circACTA2, acting as a sponge binding microRNA (miR)-548f-5p, interacted with miR-548f-5p targeting 3' untranslated region of alpha-SMA mRNA, which in turn relieves miR-548f-5p repression of the alpha-SMA expression and thus upregulates alpha-SMA expression, thereby facilitating stress fiber formation and cell contraction in HASMCs. Accordingly, in vivo studies demonstrated that the localization of the interaction of circACTA2 with miR-548f-5p is significantly decreased in human intimal hyperplastic arteries compared with normal arteries, implicating that dysregulation of circACTA2 and miR-548f-5p expression is involved in intimal hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that circACTA2 mediates NRG-1-ICD regulation of alpha-SMA expression in HASMCs via the NRG-1-ICD/circACTA2/miR-548f-5p axis. Our data provide a molecular basis for fine-tuning alpha-SMA expression and VSMC contraction by transcription factor, circular RNA, and microRNA.","['(c) 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['ACTA2', 'TGF-beta1', 'circular RNA', 'miR-548', 'neuregulin-1', 'smooth muscle cells']",,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,,,,['Circ Res. 2017 Sep 1;121(6):591-593.

After the growth trial, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila for 14 days. The results indicated that optimal levels of dietary protein: (1) (1) increased the lysozyme (LA) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities and the complement 3 (C3) and C4 contents, up-regulated antimicrobial peptides, anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibitor of kappaBalpha, target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 mRNA levels, whereas down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) P65, IKKbeta, IKKgamma, eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP) 1 and 4E-BP2 mRNA levels in the head kidney, spleen and skin of grass carp (P < 0.05), suggesting that optimal level of dietary protein could enhance immune function in the head kidney, spleen and skin of fish; (2) increased the activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, enhanced the glutathione content, decreased reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl contents, and up-regulated the mRNA levels of NF-E2-related factor 2, B-cell lymphoma protein-2, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, myeloid cell leukemia-1 and tight junction complexes, whereas down-regulated Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein (Keap) 1b, cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease 3, 8, 9, Fas ligand, apoptotic protease activating factor-1, Bcl-2 associated X protein and myosin light chain kinase mRNA levels in the head kidney, spleen and skin of grass carp (P < 0.05), indicating that optimal level of dietary protein could improve structural integrity in the head kidney, spleen and skin of fish.

Asparagine depletion has been associated with improved outcomes in ALL patients; this has led to an increased emphasis on optimizing asparagine depletion in ALL patients of all ages. To ensure adequate asparagine depletion, the use of therapeutic drug monitoring of asparaginase therapy holds much promise, yet remains underutilized in practice. Data regarding asparaginase activity level monitoring and associated outcomes are reviewed, and an evidence-based asparaginase activity level monitoring algorithm is presented.

Epub 2017 Jul 8.,"Anti-tumor efficacy of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is dependent on their specificity, survival, and in vivo expansion following adoptive transfer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) and CD40 signaling in T cells can improve persistence and drive proliferation of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells following pathogen challenge or in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) settings, suggesting that these costimulatory pathways may be co-opted to improve CAR-T cell persistence and function. Here, we present a novel strategy to activate TLR and CD40 signaling in human T cells using inducible MyD88/CD40 (iMC), which can be triggered in vivo via the synthetic dimerizing ligand, rimiducid, to provide potent costimulation to CAR-modified T cells. Importantly, the concurrent activation of iMC (with rimiducid) and CAR (by antigen recognition) is required for interleukin (IL)-2 production and robust CAR-T cell expansion and may provide a user-controlled mechanism to amplify CAR-T cell levels in vivo and augment anti-tumor efficacy.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 120 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent 601 times of HDMTX therapy. The adverse effects of various systems were analyzed according to the WHO criteria for the classification of adverse effects of anticancer drugs. RESULTS: Almost all the children experienced bone marrow suppression, and 93.3% had granulocytopenia. The most common adverse effects in the digestive system and urinary system were elevated glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (60.4%) and proteinuria (9.2%) respectively. For skin symptoms, skin erythema had the highest incidence rate (7.2%). The adverse effects in the nervous system (hyperpathia, numbness of extremities, or headache) were only observed in 7 cases. Serious adverse effects were only seen in the blood system and digestive system. Compared with the 3 g/m(2) methotrexate (MTX) group, the 5 g/m(2) HDMTX group had a significantly higher 24-hour plasma MTX concentration, significant reductions in hemoglobin and platelet count, and significantly higher incidence rates of oral mucositis, proteinuria, and skin symptoms (P<0.05).

Development of ATL is a multistep clonal process that can be investigated by monitoring the clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells by isolation of provirus integration sites. The clonal composition (size, number, and combinations of clones) during the latency period in a given infected individual has not been clearly elucidated. METHODS: We used high-throughput sequencing technology coupled with a tag system for isolating integration sites and measuring clone sizes from 60 clinical samples. We assessed the role of clonality and clone size dynamics in ATL onset by modeling data from high-throughput monitoring of HTLV-1 integration sites using single- and multiple-time-point samples. RESULTS: From four size categories analyzed, we found that big clones (B; 513-2048 infected cells) and very big clones (VB; >2048 infected cells) had prognostic value. No sample harbored two or more VB clones or three or more B clones. We examined the role of clone size, clone combination, and the number of integration sites in the prognosis of infected individuals. We found a moderate reverse correlation between the total number of clones and the size of the largest clone. We devised a data-driven model that allows intuitive representation of clonal composition. CONCLUSIONS: This integration site-based clonality tree model represents the complexity of clonality and provides a global view of clonality data that facilitates the analysis, interpretation, understanding, and visualization of the behavior of clones on inter- and intra-individual scales. It is fully data-driven, intuitively depicts the clonality patterns of HTLV-1-infected individuals and can assist in early risk assessment of ATL onset by reflecting the prognosis of infected individuals. This model should assist in assimilating information on clonal composition and understanding clonal expansion in HTLV-1-infected individuals.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T cell leukemia', '*Clonal expansion', '*Data-driven modeling', '*High-throughput sequencing', '*Human T cell leukemia virus type 1', '*Integration site', '*Prognostic indicator']",,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",PMC5505134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies showed that hematopoietic-specific deletion of Asxl1 or overexpression of mutant ASXL1 resulted in myelodysplasia-like disease in mice. However, actual effects of a ""physiological"" dose of mutant ASXL1 remain unexplored. METHODS: We established a knock-in mouse model bearing the most frequent Asxl1 mutation and studied its pathophysiological effects on mouse hematopoietic system. RESULTS: Heterozygotes (Asxl1 (tm/+) ) marrow cells had higher in vitro proliferation capacities as shown by more colonies in cobblestone-area forming assays and by serial re-plating assays. On the other hand, donor hematopoietic cells from Asxl1 (tm/+) mice declined faster in recipients during transplantation assays, suggesting compromised long-term in vivo repopulation abilities. There were no obvious blood diseases in mutant mice throughout their life-span, indicating Asxl1 mutation alone was not sufficient for leukemogenesis. However, this mutation facilitated engraftment of bone marrow cell overexpressing MN1. Analyses of global gene expression profiles of ASXL1-mutated versus wild-type human leukemia cells as well as heterozygote versus wild-type mouse marrow precursor cells, with or without MN1 overexpression, highlighted the association of in vivo Asxl1 mutation to the expression of hypoxia, multipotent progenitors, hematopoietic stem cells, KRAS, and MEK gene sets. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed global patterns of Asxl1 mutation-modulated H3K27 tri-methylation in hematopoietic precursors. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed the first Asxl1 mutation knock-in mouse model and showed mutated Asxl1 lowered the threshold of MN1-driven engraftment and exhibited distinct biological functions on physiological and malignant hematopoiesis, although it was insufficient to lead to blood malignancies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asxl1', '*Engraftment', '*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*MN1']",,"['0 (Asxl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",PMC5504705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to determine the risk of each type of subsequent cancers. Relative risk was assessed to determine the impact of liver transplantation on the development of second malignant neoplasms. RESULTS: On SIR analysis, the following sites have an enhanced risk of developing an SMN following the diagnosis of HCC: tongue, anal canal, liver, lung, kidney, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (both nodal and extra-nodal disease) and acute monocytic leukemia (P < 0.05 for all sites).

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"Chemotherapy is a crucial adjuvant therapy of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, enhancing sensitivity and tolerance of chemotherapeutics in NPC treatment have been challenging. Both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, 2 pro-survival proteins of Bcl-2 family, play essential roles on the chemotherapy tolerance of numerous cancers. In the present study, we explored the influences of TW-37, a small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, on the efficiency of chemotherapy for NPC. Oncomine cancer database shows that NPC tissues have higher expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 than those of normal nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) tissues. And our results reveal that chemotherapeutics, Cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-Fluoracil (5-FU), result in the greater decrease of protein level of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in NPC cells than those in NPE cells. TW-37 does not have significant impact on the chemotherapeutics-treated NPE cell viability at a dosage that efficiently reduces chemotherapeutics-treated NPC cell viability. Moreover, impacts of TW-37 on the cell viability of chemotherapeutics-treated NPC cells are dependent on the expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in NPC cells. Further explorations suggest that TW-37 prominently promotes apoptosis in NPC cells under chemotherapeutics treatments but not in NPE cells. Meanwhile, TW-37 also remarkably reduces colony formation ability of chemotherapeutics-treated NPC cells. Importantly, in vivo models, TW-37 observably increases chemosensitivity of NPC tumors but has not markedly influence on the normal tissues in mice. In conclusion, our results point to TW-37 as a promising ancillary drug for the chemotherapy of NPC.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'Mcl-1', 'TW-37', 'chemosensitivity', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'tolerance']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TW-37 compound)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",PMC5539829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"BACKGROUND: Children receiving immunosuppressive treatment for cancer are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) can prevent pneumococcal disease in healthy children; however, there is an absence of literature regarding the benefit of PCV13 in immunocompromised children with cancer. METHODS: A prospective, open-label cohort study recruited children between ages 1 and 18 years who were receiving active immunosuppressive therapy (AIT) or were within 12 months after completing immunosuppressive therapy (CIT). Blood samples were taken before and 4 weeks after the administration of single-dose PCV13. Serotype-specific immunoglobulin G antibody titers were measured, and titers >/=0.35 mug/mL were considered protective. Solicited side effects were recorded in a 7-day diary after vaccination. RESULTS: Eighty-five children were recruited. At baseline, </=50% had protective antibody titers against Streptococcus pneumoniae for 10 serotypes in the AIT group and for 8 serotypes in the CIT group. Postvaccination, >/=70% had protective antibody titers for 9 and 11 serotypes in the AIT and CIT groups, respectively. Both groups had comparable responses to PCV7 serotypes, whereas a significantly higher proportion in the CIT group achieved protective antibody titers to PCV13 serotypes. There was a low rate of serious adverse events (3.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A single-dose of PCV13 is safe and immunogenic in children diagnosed with cancer. All children who are receiving therapy for cancer should receive a single dose of PCV13 as soon as possible after diagnosis, regardless of prior PCV exposure. The current data support the recommendation for an additional dose of PCV13 after the completion of immunosuppressive therapy to provide additional protection against invasive pneumococcal disease.

The patient died from rapid disease progression following eight days of continuous treatment with ATRA. Karyotype analysis and RNA-Seq revealed the presence of a novel t(4;15)(q31;q22) reciprocal translocation involving the TMEM154 and RASGRF1 genes. Analysis of primary cells from the patient revealed the expression of TMEM154-RASGRF1 mRNA and the resulting fusion protein, but no expression of the reciprocal RASGRF1-TMEM154 fusion. Consistent with the response of the patient to ATRA therapy, we observed a rapid proliferation of t(4;15) primary cells following ATRA treatment ex vivo. Preliminary characterization of the retinoid response of t(4;15) AML revealed that in stark contrast to non-t(4;15) AML, these cells proliferate in response to specific agonists of RARalpha and RARgamma. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the levels of nuclear RARgamma upon ATRA treatment.

Epub 2017 Jul 10.,"Small, noncoding RNAs are short untranslated RNA molecules, some of which have been associated with cancer development. Recently we showed that a class of small RNAs generated during the maturation process of tRNAs (tRNA-derived small RNAs, hereafter ""tsRNAs"") is dysregulated in cancer. Specifically, we uncovered tsRNA signatures in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lung cancer and demonstrated that the ts-4521/3676 cluster (now called ""ts-101"" and ""ts-53,"" respectively), ts-46, and ts-47 are down-regulated in these malignancies. Furthermore, we showed that tsRNAs are similar to Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and demonstrated that ts-101 and ts-53 can associate with PiwiL2, a protein involved in the silencing of transposons. In this study, we extended our investigation on tsRNA signatures to samples collected from patients with colon, breast, or ovarian cancer and cell lines harboring specific oncogenic mutations and representing different stages of cancer progression. We detected tsRNA signatures in all patient samples and determined that tsRNA expression is altered upon oncogene activation and during cancer staging. In addition, we generated a knocked-out cell model for ts-101 and ts-46 in HEK-293 cells and found significant differences in gene-expression patterns, with activation of genes involved in cell survival and down-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and chromatin structure. Finally, we overexpressed ts-46 and ts-47 in two lung cancer cell lines and performed a clonogenic assay to examine their role in cell proliferation. We observed a strong inhibition of colony formation in cells overexpressing these tsRNAs compared with untreated cells, confirming that tsRNAs affect cell growth and survival.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ncRNA', '*tDR', '*tRF', '*tRNA fragments', '*tsRNA']","['U01 CA196383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA166905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (RNA, Small Untranslated)']",PMC5544330,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This prospective randomized controlled trial evaluated the difference in neutropenic infection rates in pediatric oncology patients randomized to Food and Drug Administration approved food safety guidelines (FSGs) versus the ND plus FSGs during one cycle of chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Pediatric patients receiving cancer treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy were eligible. Neutropenic infection was the primary outcome and defined as (i) fever with neutropenia or (ii) hospital admission and treatment for clinical infection and neutropenia. The rate of neutropenic infection was compared with Student's t-test for independent samples. Documented infections were identified by comprehensive chart review and compared between groups using a chi(2) test. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were randomly assigned to FSGs (n = 73) or ND + FSGs (n = 77). The most common diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (32%) and sarcoma (32%). There was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of patients who developed neutropenic infection: FSGs 33% versus ND + FSGs 35% (P = 0.78). Patients randomized to ND + FSGs reported that following the diet required more effort than those on FSGs alone. CONCLUSION: The ND offers no benefit over FSGs in the prevention of infection in pediatric oncology patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy and adherence requires more effort for patients and families. Institutions caring for children with cancer should consider replacing ND guidelines with FSGs.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'febrile neutropenia', 'infections in immunocompromised hosts', 'nutrition', 'pediatric hematology/oncology']",,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2499-8680'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The practice of palliative radiation therapy (RT) is based on extrapolation from adult literature. We evaluated patterns of pediatric palliative RT to describe regimens used to identify opportunity for future pediatric-specific clinical trials. DESIGN/METHODS: Six international institutions with pediatric expertise completed a 122-item survey evaluating patterns of palliative RT for patients </=21 years old from 2010 to 2015. Two institutions use proton RT. Palliative RT was defined as treatment with the goal of symptom control or prevention of immediate life-threatening progression. RESULTS: Of 3,225 pediatric patients, 365 (11%) were treated with palliative intent to a total of 427 disease sites. Anesthesia was required in 10% of patients. Treatment was delivered to metastatic disease in 54% of patients. Histologies included neuroblastoma (30%), osteosarcoma (18%), leukemia/lymphoma (12%), rhabdomyosarcoma (12%), medulloblastoma/ependymoma (12%), Ewing sarcoma (8%), and other (8%). Indications included pain (43%), intracranial symptoms (23%), respiratory compromise (14%), cord compression (8%), and abdominal distention (6%). Sites included nonspine bone (35%), brain (16% primary tumors, 6% metastases), abdomen/pelvis (15%), spine (12%), head/neck (9%), and lung/mediastinum (5%). Re-irradiation comprised 16% of cases. Techniques employed three-dimensional conformal RT (41%), intensity-modulated RT (23%), conventional RT (26%), stereotactic body RT (6%), protons (1%), electrons (1%), and other (2%). The most common physician-reported barrier to consideration of palliative RT was the concern about treatment toxicity (83%). CONCLUSION: There is significant diversity of practice in pediatric palliative RT. Combined with ongoing research characterizing treatment response and toxicity, these data will inform the design of forthcoming clinical trials to establish effective regimens and minimize treatment toxicity for this patient population.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['palliative radiation therapy', 'palliative therapy', 'pediatric radiation therapy']",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7514-0943', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4933-6712']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in absorption and bioavailability between these formulations may result in variability in serum posaconazole concentrations. The primary objective of this retrospective analysis was to compare attainment of goal serum posaconazole steady state concentrations (Css) >/= 700 ng/ml in patients with AML/MDS undergoing induction chemotherapy receiving PCZ-susp 600-800 mg per day (N = 118) versus PCZ-Tablet 300 mg twice daily for one day, followed by 300 mg daily (N = 64). Sixty-two patients (97%) in the PCZ-tab group compared to 20 patients (17%) in the PCZ-susp group achieved goal Css (P < 0.0001). Median posaconazole serum Css was 1,665 ng/ml (522-3,830 mg/ml) in the PCZ-tab group versus 390 ng/ml (51-1,870 ng/ml) in the PCZ-susp group (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in hepatotoxicity, QTc prolongation, or breakthrough IFI. Patients receiving PCZ-tab were significantly more likely to achieve goal Css and demonstrated higher Css versus patients receiving PCZ-susp. Prospective studies are needed to assess the potential correlation of serum concentrations with efficacy and toxicity.",,,,['U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC5485328,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6955-2917', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9776-4802']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence of unique clonal capacities to engraft within patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models suggests that intrapatient genetic architecture may be defined by functional differences at the clonal level. However, methods to detect functional differences assigned to genetically defined clones remain limited. Here, we describe a scalable method to directly measure the functional properties of clones within the same leukemia patient by coupling intracellular flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing (NGS). We provide proof of concept utilizing primary chronic myelmonocytic leukemia (CMML) samples and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to elucidate the interaction between tumor heterogeneity and microenvironmental factors. Mixtures of human leukemia cell lines, with known response to GM-CSF, were used to validate the accuracy of our methodology. Using this approach, we confirm that our method is capable of discriminating GM-CSF sensitive cell lines, identifies somatic variants in primary leukemia samples, and resolves functional clonal architecture in an illustrative patient. Taken together, our data describes a novel method to determine intrapatient functional clonal heterogeneity and provides proof-of-concept for future investigation aimed at elucidating the clinical relevance of functional clonal differences.",,,,['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],PMC7771351,['NIHMS1653796'],,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1664-3222'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HBV reactivation during or after chemotherapy is a potentially fatal complication for cancer patients with chronic HBV infection. Transcription of HBV is a critical intermediate step of the HBV life cycle. However, factors controlling HBV transcription remain largely unknown. Here, we found that different P-TEFb complexes are involved in the transcription of the HBV viral genome. Both BRD4 and the super elongation complex (SEC) bind to the HBV genome. The treatment of bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 stimulates HBV transcription and increases the occupancy of BRD4 on the HBV genome, suggesting the bromodomain-independent recruitment of BRD4 to the HBV genome. JQ1 also leads to the increased binding of SEC to the HBV genome, and SEC is required for JQ1-induced HBV transcription. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which the HBV genome hijacks the host P-TEFb-containing complexes to promote its own transcription. Our findings also point out an important clinical implication, that is, the potential risk of HBV reactivation during therapy with a BRD4 inhibitor, such as JQ1 or its analogues, which are a potential treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['BRD4', 'hepatitis B virus', 'super elongation complex', 'transcriptional elongation']",,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)']",PMC5599714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present our experience of genomic profiling, pretransplantation therapy, and transplantation outcomes for 36 well-characterized pediatric and adult patients with MPAL, defined according to the 2016 World Health Organization leukemia update. A predominance of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)-associated mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities was noted. Remission rates after induction appeared comparable among adults (20 of 23) and children (11 of 13) and among those who received ALL (10 of 11) or acute myeloid leukemia-type (21 of 25) induction. Adults underwent transplantation in first remission while children underwent transplantation in the setting of relapse or MLL rearrangement. The median follow-up among the 25 patients who underwent transplantation was 39.6 months and median overall survival was not reached. Relapse after transplantation was associated with MLL rearrangement (P = .022), reduced-intensity conditioning (P < .001), and higher WBC at diagnosis (P = .034). These data highlight differing therapeutic approaches between adult and pediatric MPAL and demonstrate favorable survival of adult MPAL patients consolidated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hence we have used 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and cholesterol lipo-ATRA to investigate its molecular therapeutic effect on lung cancer. The objective was to find whether it could enhance ATRA receptor, RAR-beta expression in lung cells as it was lost in majority of cancers including lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was made in an experimental C57BL/6 mice model developed by tail vein injection of B16F10 cells and in A549 human lung cancer cells. The RAR-beta protein expression was studied by Immunohistochemistry/Immunocytochemistry and the mRNA expression was studied by RT-PCR and qPCR methods. KEY FINDINGS: Both free and lipo-ATRA treatments showed an enhancement of RAR-beta protein and gene expressions, indicating its induction on RAR beta. However, lipo-ATRA treatment has shown significant induction when compared with free ATRA treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results implies that the DSPC lipo-ATRA treatment might have accumulated more ATRA in to the target cells which might have resulted in the induction of its receptor RAR-beta expression in a hypothesis of ligand induced receptor expression.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jun 17.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with genetically high-risk relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia have shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) with kinase- and BCL2-inhibitors (KI, BCL2i). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) may result in sustained PFS, especially in younger patients because of its age-dependent non-relapse mortality (NRM) risk, but outcome data are lacking for this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Risk factors for 2-year NRM and 8-year PFS were identified in patients < 50 years in an updated European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry cohort (n = 197; median follow-up, 90.4 months) by Cox regression modeling, and predicted probabilities of NRM and PFS of 2 reference patients with favorable or unfavorable characteristics were plotted. RESULTS: Predictors for poor 8-year PFS were no remission at the time of alloHCT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.5) and partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched unrelated donor (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.5-5.2). The latter variable also predicted a higher risk of 2-year NRM (HR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.4-11.6) compared with HLA-matched sibling donors. Predicted 2-year NRM and 8-year PFS of a high cytogenetic risk (del(17p) and/or del(11q)) patient in remission with a matched related donor were 12% (95% CI, 3%-22%) and 54% (95% CI, 38%-69%), and for an unresponsive patient with a female partially HLA-matched unrelated donor 37% (95% CI, 12%-62%) and 38% (95% CI, 13%-63%). CONCLUSION: Low predicted NRM and high 8-year PFS in favorable transplant high cytogenetic risk patients compares favorably with outcomes with KI or BCL2i. Taking into account the amount of uncertainty for predicting survival after alloHCT and after sequential administration of KI and BCL2i, alloHCT remains a valid option for younger patients with high cytogenetic risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a well-HLA-matched donor.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the risk factors of ICH death were evaluated. RESULT: Median age at ICH was 51years old, in which men accounted for 52.2%. They also accounted for 85.6% of acute myeloid leukemia. The relative incidence of ICH was the highest in M2 and M5 (60.1%). ICH presented with higher peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) (P<0.001), lower peripheral platelet counts (P<0.001), lower albumin (P<0.001), lower fibrous protein (P<0.001) and prolongation of prothrombin time (P<0.001) compared to those observed in the patients of NICH group; multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for death in patients with ICH include: WBC>/=30.00x109/l and prothrombin time>/=12.91 s.

ETV6 has been strongly implicated in the molecular etiology of a number of hematopoietic diseases, including as a tumor suppressor, an oncogenic fusion partner, and an important regulator of thrombopoiesis, but recent evidence has also identified ETV7 as a potential oncogene in certain malignancies.

This study was designed to determine the functional capacity of the immune system in adult patients with AML who have completed chemotherapy and are potential candidates for immunotherapy. METHODS: We used the response to seasonal influenza vaccination as a surrogate for the robustness of the immune system in 10 AML patients in a complete remission post-chemotherapy and performed genetic, phenotypic, and functional characterization of adaptive immune cell subsets. RESULTS: Only 2 patients generated protective titers in response to vaccination, and a majority of patients had abnormal frequencies of transitional and memory B-cells. B-cell receptor sequencing showed a B-cell repertoire with little evidence of somatic hypermutation in most patients. Conversely, frequencies of T-cell populations were similar to those seen in healthy controls, and cytotoxic T-cells demonstrated antigen-specific activity after vaccination. Effector T-cells had increased PD-1 expression in AML patients least removed from chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that while some aspects of cellular immunity recover quickly, humoral immunity is incompletely reconstituted in the year following intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML. The observed B-cell abnormalities may explain the poor response to vaccination often seen in AML patients after chemotherapy. Furthermore, the uncoupled recovery of B-cell and T-cell immunity and increased PD-1 expression shortly after chemotherapy might have implications for the success of several modalities of immunotherapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adaptive immunity', '*B-cells', '*Immunotherapy', '*Influenza vaccination', '*Leukemia', '*T-cells']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",PMC5504716,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6661-3190'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relapse is postulated to be due to leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which are different from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). LIN28B is microRNA regulator and stem cell reprogramming factor. Overexpression of LIN28B has been associated with advance human malignancies and cancer stem cells (CSCs), including AML. However, the molecular mechanism by which LIN28B contributes to the development of AML remains largely elusive. METHODS: We modulated LIN28B expression in AML and non-leukemic cells and investigated functional consequences in cell proliferation, cell cycle, and colony-forming assays. We performed a microarray-based analysis for LIN28B-silencing cells and interrogated gene expression data with different bioinformatic tools. AML mouse xenograft model was used to examine the in vivo function of LIN28B. RESULTS: We demonstrated that targeting LIN28B in AML cells resulted in cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cell proliferation and colony formation, which was induced by de-repression of let-7a miRNA. On the other hand, overexpression of LIN28B promoted cell proliferation. Data point to a mechanism where that inhibition of LIN28B induces metabolic changes in AML cells. IGF2BP1 was confirmed to be a novel downstream target of LIN28B via let-7 miRNA in AML. Notably, ectopic expression of LIN28B increased tumorigenicity, while silencing LIN28B led to slow tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, these results uncover a novel mechanism of an important regulatory signaling, LIN28B/let-7/IGF2BP1, in leukemogenesis and provide a rationale to target this pathway as effective therapeutic strategy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Cancer metabolism', '*IGF2BP1', '*LIN28B', '*Stem cell', '*let-7 microRNA']",,"['0 (LIN28B protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)']",PMC5504806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, patients from racial and ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in clinical trials. Primary care physicians are a trusted source of information for patients, yet their role in decision-making about cancer treatment and referrals to trial participation has received little attention. The aim of this study was to determine physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about cancer clinical trials, their experience with trials, and their interest in appropriate training about trials. METHODS: A total of 613 physicians in the New York City area primarily serving patients from ethnic and racial minority groups were invited via email to participate in a 20-min online survey. Physicians were asked about their patient population, trial knowledge and attitudes, interest in training, and personal demographics. Using calculated scale variables, we used descriptive statistical analyses to better understand physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about trials. RESULTS: A total of 127 physicians completed the survey. Overall, they had low knowledge about and little experience with trials. However, they generally had positive attitudes toward trials, with 41.4% indicating a strong interest in learning more about their role in trials, and 35.7% indicating that they might be interested. Results suggest that Black and Latino physicians and those with more positive attitudes and beliefs were more likely to be interested in future training opportunities. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians may be an important group to target in trying to improve cancer clinical trial participation among minority patients.

Epub 2017 Jul 27.,"INTRODUCTION: Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become an indispensable tool for the characterization of the proteome and its post-translational modifications (PTM). In addition to standard protein sequence databases, proteogenomics strategies search the spectral data against the theoretical spectra obtained from customized protein sequence databases. Up to date, there are no published proteogenomics studies on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Areas covered: Proteogenomics involves the understanding of genomic and proteomic data. The intersection of both datatypes requires advanced bioinformatics skills. A standard proteogenomics workflow that could be used for the study of AML samples is described. The generation of customized protein sequence databases as well as bioinformatics tools and pipelines commonly used in proteogenomics are discussed in detail. Expert commentary: Drawing on evidence from recent cancer proteogenomics studies and taking into account the public availability of AML genomic data, the interpretation of present and future MS-based AML proteomic data using AML-specific protein sequence databases could discover new biological mechanisms and targets in AML.

Epub 2017 May 17.,"Raf kinase trapping to Golgi (RKTG) is reported to be a tumor suppressor in a number of solid tumors due to its negative modulation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. However, the role of RKTG in the progression of leukemia remains unknown. In the present study, a human leukemia U937 cell line overexpressing RKTG was established, and the effect of RKTG on proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of human leukemia cells was analyzed. The results of the present study demonstrated that exogenous overexpression of RKTG significantly inhibited cell proliferation, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis assay and Hoechst staining demonstrated that the percentage of apoptotic cells in RKTG overexpressing cells was markedly increased. Furthermore, western blotting showed that RKTG overexpression significantly increased the level of cleaved caspase 3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)-associated X apoptosis regulator and reduced the level of Bcl-2. In addition, the activation of ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 signaling pathways in human leukemia cells was also suppressed by RKTG overexpression. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the tumor-suppressive effect of RKTG on human leukemia cells, which seem to be partially dependent on the suppression of ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling. Overexpression of RKTG may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Raf kinase trapping to Golgi', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase 1', 'proliferation']",,,PMC5494687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficient elimination of metastasized PDA is critical for a positive post-surgical treatment outcome. The present study analyzed the effect of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xL) inhibitor, ABT-737, on paclitaxel-induced PDA cell death. A total of 8 PDA cell lines were subjected to immunoblotting to compare the expression of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and other factors associated with taxane resistance, including myeloid cell leukemia 1 and betaIII-tubulin (TUBB3). The viability of PDA cells was analyzed following treatment with paclitaxel alone or a combination treatment with ABT-737 and paclitaxel. Treatment with the ABT-737/paclitaxel combination induced PDA cell death at a lower concentration of paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone. In addition, the viable cell population at the saturation point of paclitaxel was also decreased by co-treatment with ABT-737. ABT-737 lowered the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) by >2-fold in PDA cells with high Bcl-2/Bcl-xL expression, but not in PDA cells with low Bcl-2/Bcl-xL expression and high TUBB3 expression. Knockdown of Bcl-xL lowered the IC50 of paclitaxel, but knockdown of TUBB3 did not. ABT-737 sensitized PDA to paclitaxel-induced cell death, and Bcl-xL expression was a key determinant of its sensitivity. ABT-737 is potential candidate for combination chemotherapy of PDA with high Bcl-xL expression levels.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'B-cell extra-large', 'B-cell lymphoma-2', 'paclitaxel', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma']",,,PMC5494882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, suPAR was associated with chemoresistance in lung cancer. However, its clinical significance in leukemia has not previously been investigated. The present study examined the plasma levels of suPAR and the expression of the uPAR on bone marrow (BM) cells in 86 patients with leukemia at diagnosis prior to chemotherapy and 26 normal subjects (control group). The plasma suPAR levels were measured using ELISA, whilst uPAR expression was assayed by flow cytometry analysis. In addition, cell surface uPAR expression on K562 and multidrug-resistant K562/ADM cell lines was studied by western blotting. On admission and follow-up, the levels of suPAR in patients with leukemia were significantly increased compared with controls. Systemic levels of suPAR were strongly associated with the numbers of white blood cells. A case was defined as uPAR-positive (uPAR+) if >20% of the gated cells expressed uPAR. In comparison with 26 healthy BM samples that were negative for uPAR expression, 48 (55.8%) of the 86 leukemia patients were uPAR+. uPAR expression on the cell surface of multidrug-resistant K562/ADM cells was increased compared with that on K562 cells. In conclusion, plasma suPAR expression may be a useful marker for subtype classification of patients with leukemia and cell surface uPAR may be associated with resistance to chemotherapy or disease progression.",,['NOTNLM'],"['chemoresistance', 'leukemia', 'uPAR']",,,PMC5494859,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this study, we selected 53 patients with leukemia treated at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 2014 to September 2015 and 46 healthy patients as the control group. We used polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers for DNA typing which was carried out to analyze the patients HLA-A/B gene polymorphism. We also used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting method to measure the protein expression of different genotypes and activity. Compared to the control group, HLA-A04, B08 gene frequencies were significantly lower than those of HLA-A04, B08 gene frequencies of the observation group; results were statistically significant (chi(2)=16.28, P<0.05; chi(2)=16.47, P<0.05). However, in the control group, the frequency of HLA-A09 gene was significantly higher than that of the observation group; there was a significant difference between the two groups (chi(2)=15.28, P<0.05). Through the measurement of the protein expression levels of the different genotypes in the control group and the observation group, it was found that in the observation group, HLA-A04, B08 protein contents (4.6 and 3.2 microg/l) were significantly higher than those of the control group (0.13 and 0.1 microg/l). While the control group HLA-A09 genotype protein content (3.7 microg/l) was significantly higher than that of the observation group (0.2 microg/l); there were significant differences between both (P<0.05). Therefore, there is a significant correlation between HLA-II gene polymorphism and leukemia that is higher than HLA-A04 and B08 gene frequency and can help promote the occurrence of leukemia.

Epub 2017 May 10.,"The t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) translocation is a rare chromosomal abnormality exhibited almost exclusively in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) or in the blastic crisis phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which results in the fusion of the runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1, also called AML1) gene at 21q22 to the myelodysplasia syndrome 1 (MDS1)-ecotropic virus integration site 1 (EVI1) complex locus (MECOM) at 3q26.2, generating various fusion transcripts, including AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME). The present study examined the case of an 84-year-old Japanese woman who developed t-MDS/AML with t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) subsequent to receiving low-dose methotrexate (MTX) treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Following treatment with MTX for 6 years, the patient developed anemia and neutropenia, and MTX was discontinued. A total of 3 years later, the patient was diagnosed with MDS with t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) and del (5q), which progressed rapidly to AML within 3 months. The patients was subsequently treated with azacitidine and cytarabine chemotherapy, but succumbed to the disease 6 months after diagnosis. Sequencing analysis of the nested reverse transcription-PCR products from the leukemic cells revealed the expression of two types of alternatively-spliced AME transcripts with or without RUNX1 exon 6 sequences. Western blot analysis of the leukemic cells of the patient additionally revealed that the corresponding AME fusion protein products were expressed at high levels, and that these cells also prominently expressed CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, the repression of which has been reported to be involved in leukemogenesis mediated by AME. To the best of our knowledge, the case discussed in the present study represents the first report of MDS/AML with t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) developing following low-dose MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Nonetheless, the clinical and molecular features of the patient in the present study were representative of those patients who typically develop this disease following exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy for primary malignancy, which implicates MTX in the pathogenesis of t-MDS/AML.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of the MLAA-34 gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MLAA-34 expression level, chromosome location, gene copy number and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 40 patients with AML and 5 healthy volunteers were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence in situ hybridization and DNA sequencing. The effects of MLAA-34 mutation on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with AML were also analyzed. MLAA-34 was significantly upregulated in patients with AML when compared with volunteer controls, and this upregulation was associated with a C59T SNP site located in the second exon of MLAA-34. MLAA-34 was mapped to 13q14.2 and no translocation was observed in patients with AML. In addition, this SNP site is affinitive to the well-known molecular markers of AML, including Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 and DNA methyltransferase 3A, as well as extramedullary lesions, periphery leukocyte numbers, remission and cytogenetic abnormalities of patients with AML. Patients with AML with MLAA-34 C59T mutations had significantly shorter OS and PFS times compared with that of patients without C59T mutations. The present findings indicated that the MLAA-34 C59T mutation was a high-risk factor for recurrence of AML, and may be a candidate target for AML therapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'monocytic leukemia-associated antigen-34', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",,,PMC5494830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This progress represents one of the most successful achievements in the history of medicine and has been attributed to the development of effective chemotherapy regimens, improvement in supportive care, better risk stratification, use of targeted therapies, and advances in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent studies have revealed improvement in survival over time for all age groups and subtypes of leukaemia. However, these outcomes varied widely by age and are associated with sociodemographic and clinical factors. The present review concludes that survival and early death after acute leukaemia has greatly improved among young patients.

The main limitation of any biopsy is sampling of one tumor site, which may not represent all malignant clones due to the heterogeneity of the tumor. These clones respond to treatment differently and thus directly influence survival of the patient. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is released from multiple tumor sites, reflects overall heterogeneity of the tumor, and correlates with its progression. Detection of tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations in cfDNA could have a direct impact on molecular diagnosis, prognosis, follow-up of disease, monitoring of minimal residual disease, and response to treatment. While most cfDNA data are still experimental, they are very promising. This review focuses on cfDNA in hematological malignancies.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Loss of this critical transcription factor is strongly associated with high-risk, relapsed and therapy-resistant B-cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, especially in children. However, Ebf1 haploinsufficient mice exhibit a normal lifespan. To determine whether prolonged survival of B cells would enable tumorigenesis in Ebf1 haploinsufficient animals, we generated Ebf1(+/-)Bcl-xL(Tg) mice, which express the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in B cells. Approximately half of Ebf1(+/-)Bcl-xL(Tg) mice develop aggressive oligoclonal leukemia as they age, which engrafts in congenic wild-type recipients without prior conditioning. The neoplastic cells display a pre-B phenotype and express early developmental- and natural killer cell/myeloid-markers inappropriately. In addition, we found tumor cell-specific loss of several transcription factors critical for maintaining differentiation: EBF1, TCF3 and RUNX1. However, in the majority of tumors, loss of Ebf1 expression was not due to loss of heterozygosity.

Epub 2017 Jul 10.,"The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which tumor cells regulate the cell and non-cell constituents of surrounding stroma remains incompletely understood. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) is a pleiotropic tumor suppressor, but its role in tumor microenvironment regulation is poorly characterized. PML is frequently downregulated in many cancer types, including lung cancer. Here, we identify a PML ubiquitination pathway that is mediated by WD repeat 4-containing cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4WDR4). Clinically, this PML degradation pathway is hyperactivated in lung cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. The WDR4/PML axis induces a set of cell-surface or secreted factors, including CD73, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), which elicit paracrine effects to stimulate migration, invasion, and metastasis in multiple lung cancer models. In xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models, the WDR4/PML axis elevates intratumoral Tregs and M2-like macrophages and reduces CD8+ T cells to promote lung tumor growth. These immunosuppressive effects were all reversed by CD73 blockade. Our study identifies WDR4 as an oncoprotein that negatively regulates PML via ubiquitination to promote lung cancer progression by fostering an immunosuppressive and prometastatic tumor microenvironment, suggesting the potential of immune-modulatory approaches for treating lung cancer with aberrant PML degradation.",,,,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (WDR4 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (WDR4 protein, mouse)']",PMC5531412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using mFISH, iFISH, and T/C-FISH, we thoroughly characterized 59 CLL patients regarding parameters known to be involved in chromosomal instability: status of the genes ATM and TP53 and telomere length. Interestingly, a deletion of the ATM locus in 11q, independent of the cytogenetic context, was associated with significantly diminished risk (p<0.05) of carrying a mutation in TP53. In patients with loss or mutation of TP53, chromosomal breakage occurred more frequently (p<0.01) in (near-) heterochromatic regions. Median telomere length in patients with complex karyotypes was significantly shorter than that of healthy controls and shorter than in all other cytogenetic cohorts. Furthermore, the median telomere length of patients carrying a TP53 mutation was significantly shorter than without mutation.

However, the morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure might limit its widespread use; therefore, we implemented reduced BUCY2 as conditioning method along with the use of G-CSF-primed bone marrow (G-BM) in order to reduce complications, including graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), and to improve survival in these patients. An analysis of transplant characteristics, complications, and survival of patients undergoing an allo-HSCT using this conditioning regimen (busulfan 12 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 80 mg/kg) plus G-BM was performed. Forty patients were included from 1999 to 2015. All of them had a HLA-matched donor, with a median age of 32 years (range 16-59), and 55% were male. The most frequent diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 14 patients (35%), followed by acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in 12 (30%). The mean of CD34+ was 2.09 x 106/kg. The mean time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 20 and 18 days, respectively. The most common toxicity was mucositis (75%) with grade III-IV in 53% of cases. Acute GVHD appeared in 12.5 and 35% of patients developed chronic GVHD. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 10%. Five-year relapse-free survival was 69%, and the 5-year overall survival was 69.5%.

Epub 2017 Jul 10.,"Anthracyclines have been a cornerstone in the cure of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other hematological cancers. The ability of anthracyclines to eliminate DLBCL depends on the presence of topoisomerase-II-alpha (TopIIA), a DNA repair enzyme complex. We identified nucleolin as a novel binding partner of TopIIA. Abrogation of nucleolin sensitized DLBCL cells to TopIIA targeting agents (doxorubicin/etoposide). Silencing nucleolin and challenging DLBCL cells with doxorubicin enhanced the phosphorylation of H2AX (gammaH2AX-marker of DNA damage) and allowed DNA fragmentation. Reconstitution of nucleolin expression in nucleolin-knockdown DLBCL cells prevented TopIIA targeting agent-induced apoptosis. Nucleolin binding to TopIIA was mapped to RNA-binding domain 3 of nucleolin, and this interaction was essential for blocking DNA damage and apoptosis. Nucleolin silencing decreased TopIIA decatenation activity, but enhanced formation of TopIIA-DNA cleavable complexes in the presence of etoposide.

Current treatment intensification is not further possible, and novel therapy strategies are needed. Notably, MLL-rearranged ALL is characterised by a strongly deregulated epigenome and shows sensitivity to epigenetic perturbators. Here we demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) using xenograft mouse models of MLL-rearranged ALL. Panobinostat monotherapy showed strong anti-leukaemic effects, extending survival and reducing overall disease burden. Comprehensive molecular analyses in vitro showed that this anti-leukaemic activity involves depletion of H2B ubiquitination via suppression of the RNF20/RNF40/WAC E3 ligase complex; a pivotal pathway for MLL-rearranged leukaemic maintenance. Knockdown of WAC phenocopied loss of H2B ubiquitination and concomitant cell death induction. These combined data demonstrate that panobinostat cross-inhibits multiple epigenetic pathways, ultimately contributing to its highly efficacious targeting of MLL-rearranged ALL.",,,,"['12788/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C27943/A12788 /CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (WAC protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF40 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 8.,"BACKGROUND: The potential exists to improve treatment through characterization of tumor stem cells and identification of therapeutic targets Using OCT-4 and NANOG genes. Here we have synthesized and investigated the potential of; New Indole-3-carbaldehyde derivative (NI-3-CD) in inhibiting the expression of self-renewal regulatory factors and cancer stem cell gene in a leukemia cell line NB4. METHODOLOGY: The NB4 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium contained NI-3-CD and I3F (15.12-1000mug/mL) for 24, 48 and 72h. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by trypan blue staining technique and MTT assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit. The fold changes of NANOG/OCT4 expression against beta-actin were determined by real-time-PCR technique. Western blotting analysis was also applied for evaluating the expression of NANOG/OCT4 at protein level. Data were analyzed by student t and repeated measure tests. Differences were considered significant if (P<0.01). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in cell viability, when various concentrations of NI-3- were used for 24, 48 and 72h in comparison to I3C regarding the cellular viability. Furthermore, the NI-3-CD, had markedly elevated anticancer activity than I3C (IC50 values for novel I3C in 24, 48 and 72h were 225.77, 123.13 and 63.72M respectively while for I3C were 728.05, 407.82 and 277.92M respectively). Flow cytometry results exhibited an obviously significant augmentation in apoptotic NB4 cells. Real Time- PCR analysis indicated that the expression of NANOG/OCT4 was down regulated in compare to untreated control cells and I3C treated cells (P<0.05). In concert with RT-PCR, western blot analysis showed that the OCT4 expression in NI-3-CD treated cells was also significantly decreased in compare to both untreated control cells and I3C treated cellular populations. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that NI-3-CD treatment decreases the sphere-forming ability of NB4 cells. In summary, this study provides valuable information on the presence of stem-cell genes expression in NB4 cells.","['Copyright (c) 2017 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Epub 2017 Jul 6.,"Arginase is a therapeutic enzyme for arginine-auxotrophic cancers but their low anticancer activity, less proteolytic tolerance and shorter serum half-life are the major shortcomings. In this study, arginase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa IH2 was purified to homogeneity and estimated as 75 kDa on native-PAGE and 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Arginase showed optimum activity at pH 8 and temperature 35 degrees C. Mn(2+) and Mg(2+) ions enhanced arginase activity while, Li(+), Cu(2+), and Al(3+) ions reduced arginase activity. In-vitro serum half-life of arginase was 36 h and proteolytic half-life against trypsin and proteinase-K was 25 and 29 min, respectively. Anticancer activity of arginase was evaluated against colon, breast, leukemia, and prostate cancer cell lines and lowest IC50 (0.8 IU ml(-1)) was found against leukemia cell line HL-60. Microscopic studies and flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V/PI staining of HL-60 cells revealed that arginase induced apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis suggested that arginase induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. The increasing level of MMP loss, ROS generation and decreasing level of SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH suggested that arginase treatment triggered dysfunctioning of mitochondria. The cleavage of caspase-3, PARP-1, activations of caspase-8, 9 and high expression of proapoptotic protein Bax, low expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 indicated that arginase treatment activates mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Purified arginase did not exert cytotoxic effects on human noncancer cells. Our study strongly supports that arginase could be used as potent anticancer agent but further studies are required which are underway in our lab.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the discovery of the AS1 gene on the antisense strand of the G4 gene has affected this interpretation. In this study, we investigated the function of G4 in virus production independent of the AS1 gene using a reverse genetic approach, and briefly examined the association of the G4 protein with Tax, which is also a nonstructural protein that promotes virus replication. First, we constructed a mutant molecular clone of BLV with a nonsense mutation in G4 that had a minimal effect on the AS1 gene. Comparison of the wild-type and mutant molecular clones indicated that the nonsense mutation resulted in a reduction of virus in the culture supernatant and accumulation of viral RNA (vRNA) in cells. Moreover, G4 and Tax expression in cells was shown to synergistically enhance virus production.

Epub 2017 Jul 8.,"Diabesity is often associated with subfertility and recurrent miscarriages. Evidence links systemic and local uterine cytotoxicity to the pathogenesis of implantation failure (IF) in diabetes. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus improved pregnancy outcomes in obese and diabetic mice and repeated IF in women with elevated Th1/Th2 blood cell ratios. However the mode of action of tacrolimus in protecting against IF and the molecular mechanisms associated with recurrent miscarriages in the obese and diabetic subjects are yet to be elucidated. Here we administered tacrolimus (FK506) (0.1 mg/kg) for four consecutive weeks to the NONcNZO10/LtJ mice, a model of human PCOS, chronically fed with 60% kCal fat for 16 consecutive weeks to simulate human obesity-associated T2DM. Compared to those immunosuppressed with tacrolimus and their normative controls, high-fat fed (HFD) diabetic NONcNZO mice exhibited higher rates of peri- and post-implantation resorption and had aberrant expression of uterine IFNgamma and progesterone receptor (PGR) and its immunophilin co-chaperone FKBP52 at nidation. Immature uterodomes and lack of activation of uterine STAT3 and NFkappaB at implantation were characteristics of IF in the HFD-dNONcNZO dams also low in the deciduogenic factors IL11 and GM-CSF. Therapeutic interventions with tacrolimus or metformin normalized the expression of decidual IFNgamma, PGR and FKBP52, increased co-localization of protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy) to PGR and resulted in the upregulation of uterine IL11and LIF. Rescued phosphorylation of STAT3 and NFkappaBp65 and uterodome maturation at nidation defined implantation success in treated dams. To our knowledge this is the first report to show that the impact of HFD on the hemochorial implantation is at least in part mediated through disruption of PGR signaling at nidation and that immunosuppression with tacrolimus or treatment with metformin restores PGR-mediated influences during implantation in the obese and diabetic subjects.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: PMBCs were subjected to a low-intensity ultrasound field (1-MHz frequency; spatial peak temporal average intensity 0.18 W/cm2) followed by analysis for apoptosis and DNA damage (single-strand breaks + double-strand breaks). The comet assay was then repeated after 2 h to examine the ability of cells to repair DNA breaks. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that low-intensity ultrasound was capable of selectively inducing apoptosis in leukemic PMBCs, but not in healthy cells. The introduction of ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue resulted in an increase in apoptosis in both groups. DNA analysis after ultrasound exposure indicated that ultrasound triggered DNA damage in leukemic PMBCs (66.05 +/- 13.36%), while the damage was minimal (7.01 +/- 0.89%) in control PMBCs. However, both cell lines demonstrated an ability to repair DNA single- and double-strand breaks 2 h after sonication. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that low-intensity ultrasound selectively induced apoptosis in cancer PMBCs. Ultrasound-induced DNA damage was observed primarily in leukemic PMBCs. Nevertheless, both cell lines were able to repair ultrasound-mediated DNA strand breaks.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'DNA breaks', 'Ultrasound', 'White blood cells']","['Programme 055 ""Scientific and technical activities""; sub-programme 100', '""Programme-targeted funding"" 2014-2017/government of Republic of Kazakhstan']","['0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (contrast agent BR1)', 'WS7LR3I1D6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5696-6363'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 8.,"BACKGROUND: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) carriers may develop severe systemic diseases, such as adult T cell leukaemia (ATL) or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). This study aims to investigate systemic diseases of HTLV-1 carriers who had developed HTLV-1-associated uveitis (HAU). METHODS: We investigated the occurrence of systemic diseases in 200 patients with HAU by performing a retrospective investigation of their medical records and examining the results of a postal survey. RESULTS: The mean age of HAU onset was 49 years, and the total person-years from HAU onset was 1627. There were two cases of ATL. Of these, one was diagnosed with smouldering ATL at the time of HAU onset and the other developed acute-type ATL 4 years after HAU onset. There were 26 cases of HAM/TSP; of these, HAM/TSP occurred first in 13 cases and HAU occurred first in 11 cases. The interval between the onset of HAM/TSP and HAU ranged from 6 months to 6 years, with no significant difference observed based on whether HAM/TSP or HAU occurred first. Hyperthyroidism was noted in 45 cases and preceded onset in all cases. HAU onset occurred after starting thiamazole treatment, and in two cases HAU recurred each time thiamazole treatment was restarted. CONCLUSION: HTLV-1 carriers with HAU may develop HAM/TSP more frequently than general carriers. HTLV-1 carriers undergoing treatment for hyperthyroidism may be prone to developing HAU.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2018.

Epub 2017 Jul 5.,"Antifungal prophylaxis (AP) has dramatically changed the epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis (IA). To better understand the differences in terms of clinical significance of IA between allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) recipients and patients treated for leukemia, we report a single-center study of 735 unselected consecutive patients treated between 2000 and 2004, before the era of systematic AP. Probable or confirmed IA were observed in 29 patients (2008 EORTC/MSG criteria), including 7/235 undergoing allo-SCT (5.2%), 19/380 treated for acute leukemia (5.0%), 1/116 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.9%) and 2/104 for myelodysplastic syndrome (1.9%). In allo-SCT recipients, IA occurred later than in leukemia patients, after the neutropenic period. The median time between the last treatment and the diagnosis of IA was 231 days (range, 68-341) in allo-SCT recipients and 17 days (6-57) in leukemia patients (P<0.001). Importantly, the 7 cases of IA after allo- SCT occurred only in patients treated with corticosteroids for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Mortality directly related to IA was 24%. The 100-day, 2-year and 10-year overall survival were 42.9%, 0%, 0% in allo-SCT recipients compared to 68.1%, 18.2%, 13.6% in leukemia patients, respectively (P>/=0.05). These poor outcomes were mainly attributable to non-relapse mortality (NRM). In conclusion, our data allows distinguishing 2 types of IA occurring at different time in the treatment course. In both cases, the NRM is very high and treatment remains challenging.

Patients across all age groups from a homogeneous ethnic and socioeconomic background were studied to document age effect. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed from 2005 to 2015 at a university hospital in Northeast Mexico were divided into 4 age groups: infants (< 1), children (>/= 1 to < 16), adolescents (>/= 16 to </= 20), and adults (> 20 years). Correlation between age at diagnosis and relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 377 patients were included. Five-year RFS and OS for children were 55.6% and 66.9%; for adolescents, 36.0% and 48.3%; for adults, 19.5% and 24.1%, respectively. Differences in RFS and OS between age groups were significant (P < .001, P < .001). In the Cox regression model, all age groups reached statistical significance in univariate analysis of mortality. CONCLUSION: Age plays a decisive role in clinical evolution of ALL and strongly influences outcome.

Epub 2017 Jul 5.,"Many hematologic malignancies are diseases of aging, and the use of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is growing rapidly among older adults. Modern post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) protocols with haploidentical (haplo) donors have dramatically expanded the donor pool for patients requiring HCT. Initial studies were performed with bone marrow grafts, which require the donor to undergo anesthesia during harvest. However, the use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) may be desirable, especially with older donors. However, data on PBSC haplo-HCT in older adults are lacking. To characterize the impact of age on outcomes in haplo-HCT, we identified all adult patients undergoing haplo-HCT with PTCy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at our institution from January 2009 to June 2016. Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts: Age 1 (</=55), Age 2 (55 to 65), and Age 3 (>/=65). To characterize the impact of donor type on outcomes in older patients, we identified age- and disease risk index (DRI)-matched patient age >/= 65 undergoing HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) HCT for AML or MDS during the same time frame. Patients were scored for disease risk and underlying comorbidities using the DRI and HCT-specific comorbidity index. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using 3 different Cox proportional hazards models. We identified 112 haplo-HCT patients, 95 with AML and 17 with MDS. There were 61 patients in Age 1, 29 patients in Age 2, and 22 in Age 3. Median OS was 448, 397, and 147 days in Age 1, Age 2, and Age 3 patients (log-rank, P = .04). After adjusting for other risk factors, age >/= 65 was associated with significantly worse OS after haplo-HCT (aHR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.15 to 4.07). There was a trend toward increased relapse among older patients at 2 years (56%; 95% CI, 32% to 79%) versus Age 1 (41%; 95% CI, 28% to 54%) and Age 2 (31%; 95% CI, 12% to 50%) (P = .08). Among patients age >/= 65, donor type (MUD versus haplo) did not impact OS (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, .56 to 1.88) after adjusting for other risk factors. Prior allo-HCT (aHR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.82 to 13.49) and myeloablative conditioning (aHR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.73) were associated with inferior survival. Although age >/= 65 was associated with inferior OS in our haplo-HCT cohort, no difference was seen in survival between MUD and haplo-HCT. Therefore, the use of haploidentical donors in older patients is a reasonable treatment option, especially if there is concern for clinical deterioration. A careful pretransplant evaluation and analysis of risks and benefits is warranted when offering this transplant modality to older adults, especially in patients with previous transplant or poor performance status. Strategies to reduce the risk of relapse and decrease nonrelapse mortality in older adults are areas of ongoing research, and prospective studies are needed.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jul 6.,"A striking feature of the metabolite pattern of the Southeast Asian liana Ancistrocladus tectorius (Ancistrocladaceae) is the predominance of 5,1'-coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids. About 20 alkaloids of this coupling type have so far been discovered in this plant species. Here, we report on the isolation of four new 5,1'-linked naphthylisoquinolines from the twigs and stems of A. tectorius. Two of them, the ancistrobenomines B (5) and C (6), belong to the very rare group of alkaloids with a fully dehydrogenated isoquinoline portion. Likewise unusual for naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids is the presence of a hydroxymethylene group at C-3. Within the large class of meanwhile ca. 180 such natural products, this structural peculiarity had so far been known only from two other representatives isolated from the Malaysian species A. benomensis, and from one single naphthalene-devoid 3-hydroxymethyleneisoquinoline from A. tectorius. Seven further 5,1'-linked alkaloids, previously isolated from related Asian and African Ancistrocladus species, have now been identified for the first time in A. tectorius. Their structural elucidation was achieved by spectroscopic analysis including HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and by chemical (oxidative degradation) and chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism) methods. Ancistrobenomine B (5) exhibited moderate effects against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense in vitro, and it was found to display strong cytotoxic activities against drug-sensitive acute lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and their multidrug-resistant subline, CEM/ADR5000.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

All 4 MPN variants might progress into blast-phase disease (MPN-BP). For essential thrombocythemia, reported risk factors for leukemic transformation include advanced age, extreme thrombocytosis, anemia, leukocytosis, and sequence variants/mutations involving TP53 and EZH2 (for expansion of gene symbols, see www.genenames.org); for polycythemia vera, advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, mutations involving SRSF2 and IDH2, and treatment with pipobroman, chlorambucil, or P32; and for PMF, increased blast percentage, thrombocytopenia, abnormal karyotype, triple-negative driver mutational status, and sequence variants/mutations involving SRSF2, RUNX1, CEBPA, and SH2B3. The reported median survival figures for MPN-BP range from 1.5 to 2.5 months in patients treated with supportive care only, from 2.5 to 10 months in those receiving hypomethylating agents or low-dose chemotherapy, and from 3.9 to 9.4 months in those receiving induction chemotherapy. Three-year survival after allogeneic stem cell transplant was reported in 16% to 33% of patients. These observations validate the extremely poor prognosis associated with MPN-BP and the lack of effective drug therapy and highlight the need for urgent assessment of therapeutic values of investigational agents. In the meantime, affected patients might be best served with aggressive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant after adequate blast clearance.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

To facilitate the investigation of regulatory association between ANXA2 and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor a (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein, this work was performed to determine the transcription start site of ANXA2 promoter with rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends analysis. Zinc-induced U937/PR9 cells expressed PML/RARalpha fusion protein, and resultant increases in ANXA2 transcripts and translational expressions of both ANXA2 and S100A10, while S100A10 transcripts remained constitutive. The transactivation of ANXA2 promoter by PML/RARalpha fusion protein was 3.29 +/- 0.13 fold higher than that by control pSG5 vector or wild-type RARalpha. The overexpression of ANXA2 in U937 transfected with full-length ANXA2 cDNA was associated with increased S100A10 subunit, although S100A10 transcripts remained constitutive. The tPA-dependent initial rate of plasmin generation (IRPG) in zinc-treated U937/PR9 increased by 2.13-fold, and cell invasiveness increased by 27.6%. Antibodies against ANXA2, S100A10, or combination of both all remarkably inhibited the IRPG and invasiveness in U937/PR9 and NB4. Treatment of zinc-induced U937/PR9 or circulating APL blasts with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly reduced cell surface ANXA2 and S100A10 and associated reductions in IRPG and invasiveness. Thus, PML/RARalpha fusion protein transactivated the ANXA2 promoter to upregulate ANXA2 and accumulate S100A10. Increased AIIt promoted IRPG and invasiveness, both of which were partly abolished by antibodies against ANXA2 and S100A10 or by ATRA.",,['NOTNLM'],"['PML/RARalpha fusion protein', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer', 'cell invasion', 'plasmin']",,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100 calcium binding protein A10)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this analysis, we hypothesize that spectral clustering method could identify molecular subtypes in correlation with survival outcomes. We propose an accurate subtype identification method, Cancer Subtype Identification with Spectral Clustering using Nystrom approximation (CSISCN), for the discovery of molecular subtypes, based on spectral clustering method. CSISCN could be used to improve gene expression-based identification of breast cancer molecular subtypes. We demonstrated that CSISCN identified the molecular subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes and was valid for the number of molecular subtypes. Furthermore, CSISCN identified molecular subtypes for improving clinical and molecular relevance which significantly outperformed consensus clustering and spectral clustering methods. To test the general applicability of the CSISCN, we further applied it on human CRC datasets and AML datasets and demonstrated superior performance as compared to consensus clustering method.

Epub 2017 Jul 7.,"Accumulating evidence shows that innate immune responses are associated with extracellular nucleotides, particularly ATP. In this article, we demonstrate extensive protection of ATP/P2X7 signaling in a host against viral infection. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in ATP as a danger signal in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cell supernatant and VSV-infected mice in an exocytosis- and pannexin channel-dependent manner. Furthermore, extracellular ATP reduces the replication of VSV, Newcastle disease virus, murine leukemia virus, and HSV in vivo and in vitro through the P2X7 receptor. Meanwhile, ATP significantly increases IFN-beta expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ATP facilitates IFN-beta secretion through P38/JNK/ATF-2 signaling pathways, which are crucial in promoting antiviral immunity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the protective role of extracellular ATP and P2X7 in viral infection and suggest a potential therapeutic role for ATP/P2X7 in viral diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,"['0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5402-6527'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 7.,"LESSONS LEARNED: Ofatumumab infusion reactions can be diminished by escalating the dose rate in individual patients in sequential infusions. BACKGROUND: Ofatumumab (OFA) is a fully humanized, anti-CD20 antibody approved for use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The recommended administration requires long infusion times. We evaluated an accelerated infusion regimen of 2 hours. METHODS: The first dose of OFA (300 mg) was given on week 1 day 1 starting at 3.6 mg/hour and doubling every 30 minutes until a rate of 240 mg/hour was reached. If tolerated, the second dose (1,000 mg) was given on week 1 day 3 starting at 50 mg/hour and doubling every 30 minutes until a rate of 800 mg/hour was reached. If tolerated, the third dose (2,000 mg) was given on week 2 day 1 at 800 mg/hour over the first 30 minutes and, if tolerated, at 1,068 mg/hour over the next 90 minutes (goal infusion time: 120 minutes). Subsequent OFA infusions were administered weekly in the same manner for 8 weeks, and then monthly for 4 months. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were treated. Most infusion-related reactions occurred during the first and second infusion. Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients finished the third infusion within 15 minutes of the planned 2 hours and only one had an infusion reaction. CONCLUSION: Using this stepped-up dosing regimen, a rapid infusion of OFA is safe and well tolerated.","['(c)AlphaMedPress; the data published online to support this summary is the', 'property of the authors.']",,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",PMC5634770,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01848145'],,,,,,,

Historically, the preferred donor source is a human leukocyte antigen-matched blood relative, although only approximately 30% of patients have access to such a donor. Alternative donor sources, including matched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood, and haploidentical related donors, are available for almost every patient and are increasingly being used for patients without a matched related donor. Survival outcomes with these alternative donor sources now approximate those of matched related donor transplants. Given the safety and success of alternative donor transplants, comparative trials are needed to reassess the optimal donor source for patients with AML. This review summarizes the available data on these alternative donor transplants. Further investigation is needed to contemporize donor selection algorithms, but, in the current era, donor availability should no longer preclude a patient's eligibility for an allogeneic blood or marrow transplant.",['Copyright (c) 2017 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 4.,"BACKGROUND: The INO-VATE study demonstrated efficacy and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard care in adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Here, we report the frequency of, and potential risk factors for, hepatotoxicity in patients in this trial and after treatment and subsequent haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3, multicentre, international study, adults with relapsed or refractory, CD22-positive, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive or Ph-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who were due to receive first or second salvage treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive inotuzumab ozogamicin (starting dose 1.8 mg/m(2) per cycle [0.8 mg/m(2) on day 1; 0.5 mg/m(2) on days 8 and 15 of a 21-28 day cycle for </=6 cycles]) or standard care (either fludarabine plus cytarabine plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, mitoxantrone plus cytarabine, or high-dose cytarabine). Stratification factors at randomisation were duration of first remission (<12 months vs >/=12 months), salvage treatment phase (first vs second), and age (<55 years vs >/=55 years). We present data up to March 8, 2016. At this cutoff date, all patients had been discontinued from treatment but 54 patients were continuing in long-term follow-up. Long-term follow-up has now been completed, with the final patient's last visit on Jan 4, 2017. This prespecified safety analysis describes investigator-assessed treatment-emergent hepatotoxicity, including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (also known as veno-occlusive disease) in patients during study treatment or thereafter (without follow-up HSCT) and after study treatment and subsequent HSCT, for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01564784. FINDINGS: Between Aug 27, 2012, and and the data cutoff of March 8, 2016, 326 patients were randomly assigned to receive inotuzumab ozogamicin (n=164) or standard care (n=162). 164 patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group and 143 in the standard care group received at least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety population. At data cutoff, median duration of treatment (induction) was 8.9 weeks (IQR 4.1-13.1) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group and 0.9 weeks (0.9-1.1) in the standard care group. Treatment-emergent hepatotoxicities (of all grades) were more frequent in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (83 [51%] of 164 patients) than in the standard care group (49 [34%] of 143 patients). The frequency of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome-comprising events occurring during treatment (or follow-up without HSCT) and after treatment and subsequent HSCT-was higher in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (22 [13%]; 18 [82%] of which were grade 3 or worse) than in the standard care group (one [<1%]). During study therapy or follow-up without HSCT, five (3%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome compared with no patients in the standard care group. Of the 77 patients who received inotuzumab ozogamicin and proceeded to HSCT, 17 (22%) had sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; five events after follow-up HSCT were fatal. Of 32 patients who received standard care and proceeded to HSCT, one (3%) had (non-fatal) sinusoidal obstruction syndrome that was ongoing at the time of death due to septic shock. In multivariate analysis, conditioning with two alkylating agents (p=0.015 vs one alkylating agent) and last available pre-HSCT bilirubin concentration of greater than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN; p=0.009 vs <ULN) were associated with increased risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in patients who received inotuzumab ozogamicin. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival in patients with follow-up HSCT (inotuzumab ozogamicin vs standard care) was 1.227 (97.5% CI 0.656-2.292; one-sided stratified log-rank p=0.77); at 24 months, the estimated probability of survival was 38.9% (95% CI 27.6-50.0) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group versus 28.7% (11.2-49.1) in the standard care group. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin is associated with increased hepatotoxicity, especially after follow-up HSCT, compared with standard care.

Limited data, however, are available on the impact of cord blood unit (CBU) CMV serostatus on allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) outcomes. We analyzed, retrospectively, the impact of CBU CMV serostatus on relapse incidence (RI) and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) of single-unit CBU transplantation for acute leukemia. Data from 1177 de novo acute leukemia pediatric and adult patients transplanted within European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed. CBUs were provided by the European Cord Blood Banks. The median follow-up time for live patients was 59.9 months. The recipients of CMV-seropositive and -seronegative CBUs showed a comparable RI (33% versus 35%, respectively, P = .6) and 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM (31% versus 32%, respectively, P = .5). We conclude that CBU CMV serostatus did not influence RI and NRM in de novo acute leukemia patients after allo-UCBT and should not be included as a criteria for cord blood choice.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jul 5.,"p27(Kip1) is a cell cycle regulator firstly identified as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. For a long time, its function has been associated to cell cycle progression inhibition at G1/S boundary in response to antiproliferative stimuli. The picture resulted complicated by the discovery that p27(Kip1) is an intrinsically unstructured protein, with numerous CDK-dependent and -independent functions and involvement in many cellular processes, such as cytoskeleton dynamics and cell motility control, apoptosis and autophagy activation. Depending on the cell context, these activities might turn to be oncogenic and stimulate cancer progression and metastatization. Nevertheless, p27(Kip1) role in cancer biology suppression was underscored by myriad data reporting its down-regulation and/or cytoplasmic relocalization in different tumors, while usually no genetic alterations were found in human cancers, making the protein a non-canonical oncosuppressor. Recently, mostly due to advances in genomic analyses, CDKN1B, p27(Kip1) encoding gene, has been found mutated in several cancers, thus leading to a profound reappraisal of CDKN1B role in tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the main p27(Kip1) features, with major emphasis to its role in cancer biology and to the importance of CDKN1B mutations in tumor development.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2017 Jul 4.,"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) participates in apoptosis signaling pathway under various pathophysiological conditions. It exerts transcriptional control on the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1, which act on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Previously, we described that NF-kappaB is negatively regulated by diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKzeta), an enzyme that phosphorylates a lipid second messenger diacylglycerol. DGKzeta downregulation enhances inhibitors of NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaBalpha) degradation and p65 subunit phosphorylation, leading to enhanced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Transcriptional machinery is tightly regulated by assembly/disassembly and modification of nucleosomal components. Of those, the human NAP1-like protein (NAP1L) family functions in the transport, assembly/disassembly of nucleosome core particles. We previously identified NAP1L1 and NAP1L4 as novel DGKzeta binding partners, but the mechanism by which NAP1Ls are involved in NF-kappaB signaling pathway remains unclear. Here we show that knockdown of NAP1L1 suppresses IkappaBalpha degradation and nuclear transport of p65 subunit after treatment with TNF-alpha stimulation, leading to attenuation of the NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, whereas NAP1L4 knockdown remains silent. Moreover, ChIP assay reveals that NAP1L1 knockdown attenuates p65 binding to the Mcl-1 promoter after TNF-alpha stimulation. This attenuation leads to reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, thereby decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent apoptosis after treatment with TNF-alpha and CHX. Collectively, results of this study suggest that NAP1L1 downregulation renders the cell vulnerable to apoptotic cell death through attenuation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity on the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 gene.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is often challenging as it mimics many other infectious or malignant diseases. The disease can present in three ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis, which rarely occur together or consecutively. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 52 years old immunosuppressed Belgian woman with a long history of severe rheumatoid arthritis. She underwent bone marrow biopsy to explore thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was made by identification of Leishman Donovan (LD) bodies in macrophages. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was successful. She later developed cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with amphotericin B lipid complex. She next presented with relapsing cutaneous lesions followed by rapidly progressing lymphadenopathies. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Treatments by miltefosine, amphotericin B, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate were subsequently initiated. She later presented a recurrent bone marrow involvement treated with intramuscular paromomycin and miltefosine. She died two years later from leukemia. At the time of death, she presented with a mucosal destruction of the nose. A Leishmania-specific PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) identified L. infantum as etiological agent.

An elevated absolute lymphocyte count above 7x10(9) and CT confirmation of a Grade V splenic laceration with splenomegaly, axillary lymphadenopathy, with hemodynamic compromise led to an exploratory laparotomy and emergency splenectomy regardless of the potential for malignancy. DISCUSSION: Hemoperitoneum with blunt splenic injury (BSI) caused by abdominal trauma with hemodynamic instability should be treated with exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy even in the face of potential malignancy with splenomegaly and axillary lymphadenopathy. An appropriate oncologic work up and treatment can be provided after the emergency intervention. CONCLUSION: An emergency splenectomy is an appropriate operative intervention for a grade V splenic laceration with hemoperitoneum, splenomegaly, and axillary lymphadenopathy regardless of the potential for a neoplastic process such as B-cell CLL. Post-splenectomy vaccinations and oncologic follow-up for systemic chemotherapy should be facilitated after recovery.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"In patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), treatment-induced changes to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome have been linked to adverse outcomes, most notably graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, it is presently unknown whether this relationship is causal or consequential. Here, we performed an integrated meta-omic analysis to probe deeper into the GIT microbiome changes during allo-HSCT and its accompanying treatments. We used 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to resolve archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes within the GIT microbiomes of 16 patients undergoing allo-HSCT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. These results revealed a major shift in the GIT microbiome after allo-HSCT including a marked reduction in bacterial diversity, accompanied by only limited changes in eukaryotes and archaea. An integrated analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data was performed on samples collected from a patient before and after allo-HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia. This patient developed severe GvHD, leading to death 9 months after allo-HSCT. In addition to drastically decreased bacterial diversity, the post-treatment microbiome showed a higher overall number and higher expression levels of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). One specific Escherichia coli strain causing a paravertebral abscess was linked to GIT dysbiosis, suggesting loss of intestinal barrier integrity. The apparent selection for bacteria expressing ARGs suggests that prophylactic antibiotic administration may adversely affect the overall treatment outcome. We therefore assert that such analyses including information about the selection of pathogenic bacteria expressing ARGs may assist clinicians in ""personalizing"" regimens for individual patients to improve overall outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

However, expanding its use to include high-dose treatment of other cancers is severely hampered by serious side effects on healthy organs. To address these limitations, we loaded ATO onto folate (FA)-labeled human serum albumin (HSA) pretreated with glutathione (GSH) based on the low pH- and GSH-sensitive arsenic-sulfur bond, and we termed the resulting smart nanodrug as FA-HSA-ATO. FA-HSA-ATO could specifically recognize folate receptor-beta-positive (FRbeta+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, resulting in more intracellular accumulation of ATO. Furthermore, the nanodrug could upregulate FRbeta expression in CML cancer cells and xenograft tumor model, facilitating even more recruitment and uptake of FRbeta-targeting drugs. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that the nanodrug significantly alleviates side effects and improves therapeutic efficacy of ATO on CML and xenograft tumor model.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Epub 2017 Jul 7.,"Development of cisplatin-resistance is an obstacle in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapeutics. To investigate which molecules are associated with cisplatin-resistance, we analyzed expression profiles of several DNA repair and anti-apoptosis associated molecules in parental (A549P and H157P) and cisplatin-resistant (A549CisR and H157CisR) NSCLC cells. We detected constitutively upregulated nuclear ATM and cytosolic Mcl-1 molcules in cisplatin-resistant cells compared with parental cells. Increased levels of phosphorylated ATM (p-ATM) and its downstream molecules, CHK2, p-CHK2, p-53, and p-p53 were also detected in cisplatin-resistant cells, suggesting an activation of ATM signaling in these cells. Upon inhibition of ATM and Mcl-1 expression/activity using specific inhibitors of ATM and/or Mcl-1, we found significantly enhanced cisplatin-cytotoxicity and increased apoptosis of A549CisR cells after cisplatin treatment. Several A549CisR-derived cell lines, including ATM knocked down (A549CisR-siATM), Mcl-1 knocked down (A549CisR-shMcl1), ATM/Mcl-1 double knocked down (A549CisR-siATM/shMcl1) as well as scramble control (A549CisR-sc), were then developed. Higher cisplatin-cytotoxicity and increased apoptosis were observed in A549CisR-siATM, A549CisR-shMcl1, and A549CisR-siATM/shMcl1 cells compared with A549CisR-sc cells, and the most significant effect was shown in A549CisR-siATM/shMcl1 cells. In in vivo mice studies using subcutaneous xenograft mouse models developed with A549CisR-sc and A549CisR-siATM/shMcl1 cells, significant tumor regression in A549CisR-siATM/shMcl1 cells-derived xenografts was observed after cisplatin injection, but not in A549CisR-sc cells-derived xenografts. Finally, inhibitor studies revealed activation of Erk signaling pathway was most important in upregulation of ATM and Mcl-1 molcules in cisplatin-resistant cells. These studies suggest that simultaneous blocking of ATM/Mcl-1 molcules or downstream Erk signaling may recover the cisplatin-resistance of lung cancer.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM', 'Mcl-1', 'cisplatin-resistance', 'cisplatin-sensitivity', 'non-small cell lung cancer']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",PMC5653185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Cancer Biol Ther. 2020 May 3;21(5):476.

Epub 2017 Aug 3.,"Osteosarcoma is an aggressive malignant bone tumor that causes bone destruction. Although tumor-specific replicating oncolytic adenovirus OBP-301 induces an antitumor effect in an osteosarcoma tumor, it cannot prevent bone destruction. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is a clinically available agent that inhibits bone destruction. In this study, we investigated the potential of combination therapy with OBP-301 and ZOL against osteosarcomas with bone destruction. The antitumor activity of OBP-301 and ZOL in monotherapy or combination therapy was assessed using three human osteosarcoma cell lines (143B, MNNG/HOS, SaOS-2). The cytotoxic effect of OBP-301 and/or ZOL was measured by assay of cell apoptosis. The effect of OBP-301 and ZOL on osteoclast activation was investigated. The potential of combination therapy against tumor growth and bone destruction was analyzed using an orthotopic 143B osteosarcoma xenograft tumor model. OBP-301 and ZOL decreased the viability of human osteosarcoma cells. Combination therapy with OBP-301 and ZOL displayed a synergistic antitumor effect, in which OBP-301 promoted apoptosis through suppression of anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1).

Epub 2017 Aug 30.,"BACKGROUND: The neurons contributing to thalamic nuclei are derived from at least two distinct progenitor domains: the caudal (cTH) and rostral (rTH) populations of thalamic progenitors. These neural compartments exhibit unique neurogenic patterns, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of neurotransmitter identity remain largely unclear. RESULTS: T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (Tal1) was expressed in the early postmitotic cells in the rTH domain, and its expression was maintained in mature thalamic neurons in the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLG) and the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). To investigate a role of Tal1 in thalamic development, we used a newly generated mouse line driving Cre-mediated recombination in the rTH domain. Conditional deletion of Tal1 did not alter regional patterning in the developing diencephalon. However, in the absence of Tal1, rTH-derived thalamic neurons failed to maintain their postmitotic neuronal features, including neurotransmitter profile. Tal1-deficient thalamic neurons lost their GABAergic markers such as Gad1, Npy, and Penk in IGL/vLG. These defects may be associated at least in part with down-regulation of Nkx2.2, which is known as a critical regulator of rTH-derived GABAergic neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Tal1 plays an essential role in regulating neurotransmitter phenotype in the developing thalamic nuclei. Developmental Dynamics 246:749-758, 2017.

The aim is to alert the cytopathologists once more to the problems of differential diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of MCC and to describe the possibilities of ancillary methods performed on direct cytological smears. METHODS: EUS-FNA procedures were performed according to standard institution protocol, using 22-G needles with cytopathologist on-site. Based on rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), additional passes were made for immunocytochemistry (ICC). A mini panel of antibodies was used to aid the differential diagnosis. RESULTS: Smears revealed a dispersed pattern of small round cells with scant cytoplasm, round nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli and occasional nuclear moulding, suspicious of small cell carcinoma. Results of ICC applied to the direct cytological smears were as follows: LCA negative, Cytokeratin (clone MNF116) positive, TTF-1 negative, CD 56 positive, NSE weakly positive, Chromogranin A weakly positive and CK20 positive, in one case in a dot-like perinuclear pattern. The diagnosis of MCC was made. CONCLUSION: Increasing incidence of MCC warrants the inclusion of MCC in the differential diagnosis of tumours of small round blue cell morphology even in unusual sites. The cytomorphological features coupled with an ICC panel are usually enough to make a confident diagnosis of MCC. EUS-FNA is a minimally invasive technique which enables sampling adequate tissue for all the ancillary methods eventually needed to support the diagnosis.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['EUS-FNA', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'ancillary methods', 'immunocytochemistry', 'pancreatic metastases']",,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) has been reported in patients with CLL, the incidence and comparison to expected rates are unknown. We evaluated the incidence of CTCL among patients with CLL or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. METHODS: We searched the SEER 13 registries for patients with a diagnosis of CLL and NHL between 1992 and 2008. Among patients identified, we evaluated the incidence of CTCL. RESULTS: Among 31,286 patients with CLL, the incidence of CTCL was not significantly higher in men than women: 104.2 (95% CI, 50.0-191.8) and 28.1 (95% CI, 3.4-101.3) per 1,000,000 person-years, respectively (P = 0.06). Among 97,691 patients with NHL, the incidence of CTCL was similar in men and women (97.9 [95% CI, 62.0-146.9] and 92.0 [95% CI, 56.2-142.1] per 1,000,000 person-years, respectively; P = 0.84). The incidence of CTCL among males with CLL (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 3.0 [95% CI, 1.4-5.5]), males with NHL (SIR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.3-5.5]), and females with NHL (SIR, 5.9 [95% CI, 3.6-9.1]) was significantly higher than expected in the general population (all P < 0.001).

Safety data regarding late hematotoxicity such as late onset neutropenia (LON) are scarce. The aim of our study was to assess the incidence and to identify risk factors for LON in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL treated with B and R (B-R). One hundred forty five patients were treated with B-R as first or second line. Patients with neutropenia prior induction treatment, treated beyond second line and relapsing within 3 months after the end of induction treatment, were excluded. Patients receiving at least 1 cycle of B-R and having LON during follow-up period were included and considered as eligible for toxicity assessment. A complete blood count was performed 4 weeks after the last cycle of induction treatment and thereafter every 3 months for 1 year. Thirty six patients were identified in our cohort (incidence of 25%), mostly affected by CLL (n = 11) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (n = 15). During follow-up, 84 events of LON were recorded, 61% and 39% were of grades 1/2 and 3/4, respectively. No episode of febrile neutropenia was documented. Amongst 13 of the 15 patients with FL undergoing R maintenance, 8 had treatment discontinuation because of LON. Median time for LON (grade > 2) and time to recovery (grade < 3) were of 11.2 and 17.3 weeks, respectively. One year after B-R induction, LON persisted in 4 patients. The risk of LON was increased both in patients with FL or CLL and performance status >1. The LON in B-R treated patients is clinically relevant. Close clinical and biological follow-up and treatment prophylaxis (eg, valaciclovir and cotrimoxazole) especially for FL patients undergoing maintenance with R monotherapy seems relevant.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7301-3465'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 4.,"The introduction of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors is an important landmark in solid oncology with unprecedented practice-changing activity in various types of solid tumours. Among haematological malignancies, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been successful, so far, only in the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which typically exhibits an over-expression of PD-1 ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2) due to alterations in chromosome 9p24.1. Such positive outcomes led to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of nivolumab use in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in 2016 as the first haematological indication. Although the results in other lymphoid malignancies have not been so striking, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has led to meaningful responses in other lymphoma types such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma or several T-cell lymphomas. Monotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple myeloma has been unsatisfactory, suggesting that a combinational approach with other synergistic drugs is needed. In the case of multiple myeloma, immunomodulatory agents together with corticosteroids represent the most promising combinations.

Additionally, it was shown that SC populations display an ability to form pluripotent and/or totipotent cell populations. It was found that human ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) maintain a large capacity for differentiation into several other cell lineages, such as chondrogenic, osteogenic, neurogenic, and adipogenic, particularly during long-term, in vitro culture. In these cases, the specific media supplements that promote various pathways of differentiation, such as leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF) and/or FSH, are well recognized. However, these are only some examples of the differentiation possibilities of human SCs in vitro and other pathways still require further investigation. Many SC populations, which are directed to differentiate into specific cell types, are also successfully used in several human disease therapies, e.g. leukemia. Moreover, SCs are used for tissue scaffold construction in patients with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, the most recent knowledge about the in vitro growth and differentiation capacity of SCs is presented. Furthermore, we discuss the possible worldwide application of SCs in advanced cell and tissue bioengineering. In conclusion, it is suggested that, in the future, SCs will be a basic strategy in human therapy, and their use will open new gates in regenerative and reconstructive medicine in the 21st century.",,,,,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although pASCT carries the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) due to the reinfusion of donor-derived peripheral blood cells, the present case did not develop GVHD without prophylaxis.

The function of the PML protein is frequently lost or aberrant in human solid tumors. In human ovarian carcinoma tissue, PML detected by immunohistochemistry was highly expressed. A PML-silencing vector, pSRG-shPml, was constructed and used to transfect human ovarian cancer cells. Cells were cultured and selected with puromycin for 10-15 days, and then the PML mRNA expression levels were detected by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Proliferation and clone number of PML-depleted cells were detected using MTT assay and colony-forming assay. The protein expression associated with DNA damage and apoptosis was assessed in PML-depleted cells using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The results showed that PML was highly expressed in human ovarian tissue. The proliferation and colony formation of ovarian cancer cells were significantly inhibited after PML was depleted. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence revealed that p-H2AX and cleaved caspase-3 expression significantly increased after PML silencing. PML was located in the nucleus, and it formed foci after X-ray irradiation.

Surprisingly, although different GSs from the same cancer type can be used to measure similar biological characteristics, often rarely is there a gene shared by different GSs. To explain such a paradox, we hypothesized that GSs from the same cancer type may be regulated by common regulatory motifs. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a comprehensive motif analysis on the prognostic GSs from five cancer types. We demonstrated that GSs from individual cancer type as well as across cancer types share regulatory motifs. We also observed that transcription factors that likely bind to these shared motifs have prognostic functions in cancers. Moreover, 75% of the predicted cofactors of these transcription factors may have cancer-related functions and some cofactors even have prognostic functions. In addition, there exist common microRNAs that regulate different GSs from individual cancer types and across cancer types, several of which are prognostic biomarkers for the corresponding cancer types.

Differentiation therapy might exploit this function not only for hematological diseases, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) but also for epithelial tumors, including lung cancer. Here we show that Retinoic Acid (RA) arrests in vitro and in vivo the growth of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) resistant Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we found that RA induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in TKI resistant NSCLC cells and activates terminal differentiation programs by modulating the expression of GATA6, a key transcription factor involved in the physiological differentiation of the distal lung. In addition, our results demonstrate that RA inhibits EGFR and Wnt signaling activation, two pathways involved in NSCLC progression. Furthermore, we uncovered a novel mechanism in NSCLC that shows how RA exerts its function; we found that RA-mediated GATA6 activation is necessary for EGFR and Wnt inhibition, thus leading to 1) increased differentiation and 2) loss of proliferation. All together, these findings prove that differentiation therapy might be feasible in TKI resistant NSCLCs, and shed light on new targets to define new pharmacological therapies.",,,,,"['0 (GATA6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",PMC5500497,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1937-5403', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5746-7451', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5109-0267']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the trial concluded that survival was similar regardless of number of units infused, survival was better than previously reported. This prompted a comparison of survival of trial versus nontrial patients to determine the generalizability of trial results and whether survival was better because of the trial treatment regimen. During the trial period, 396 recipients of a single UCB unit met trial eligibility but were not enrolled. Trial patients (n = 100) received total body irradiation (TBI) 1320 cGy, cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, and fludarabine 75 mg/m(2) (TCF). Nontrial patients either received the same regimen (n = 62; nontrial TCF) or alternative regimens (n = 334; nontrial regimens). Five-year survival between trial and nontrial patients conditioned with TCF was similar (70% versus 62%). However, 5-year survival was significantly lower with nontrial TBI-containing (47%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; P = .001) and chemotherapy-only regimens (49%; HR, 1.87; P = .007). The results of BMT CTN 0501 appear generalizable to the population of trial-eligible patients.

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"Epidemiological studies of childhood leukemia survivors reveal an alarmingly high incidence of chronic health disabilities after treatment, therefore, more specific therapies need to be developed. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a key player in mitosis and a target for drug development as it is upregulated in multiple cancer types. Small molecules targeting Plk1 are mainly ATP-competitors and, therefore, are known to elicit side effects due to lack of specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is known for its high catalytic activity and target selectivity; however, the biggest barrier for its introduction into clinical use is its delivery. RNAi prodrugs are modified, self-delivering short interfering Ribonucleic Neutrals (siRNNs), cleaved by cytoplasmic enzymes into short interfering Ribonucleic Acids (siRNAs) once inside cells. In this study we aimed to investigate the potential of siRNNs as therapeutic tools in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using T-ALL cell lines and patient-derived samples. We demonstrate for the first time that RNAi prodrugs (siRNNs) targeting Plk1, can enter pediatric T-ALL patient cells without a transfection reagent and induce Plk1 knockdown on both protein and mRNA levels resulting in G2/M-arrest and apoptosis. We also show that siRNNs targeting Plk1 generate less toxicity in normal cells compared to the small molecule Plk1 inhibitor, BI6727, suggesting a potentially good therapeutic index.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to establish the incidence, microbial etiology, risk factors and prognosis of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in patients with AML and compare the results with the previous treatment protocol (AML-92). METHODS: Registery data were gathered prospectively from 357 patients aged 16-65 years recruited on the AML-2003 treatment protocol between November 2003 and November 2011 during different treatment cycles. RESULTS: Blood culture data were available on 977 treatment episodes, in which there were 503 BSIs (51%). The overall incidence rate (IR) for BSIs (per 1000 hospital days) was 16.7. Twenty patients (5.6%) died due to an infection and 16 of them (80%) had a BSI. The most commonly detected microbes (polymicrobial episodes included) in blood cultures were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS, 24.7%), viridans group streptococci (VGS, 19.1%), enterococci (13.9%) and Enterobacteriacae group (25.9%). The etiology of BSIs varied greatly from treatment cycle to cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcal BSIs have increased compared to our previous treatment protocol, and they represent significant pathogens in blood cultures. Infection-related mortality has decreased despite the increase in the IR of BSIs. Enterococci seem to be an increasingly prominent pathogen underlying BSIs in the AML patients, especially during induction therapy (20%).",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Enterococcus', 'bacteremia', 'intensive chemotherapy', 'mortality', 'neutropenia']",,,,,,,['Finnish Leukemia Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we describe fertility preservation in an adolescent female diagnosed with Myelodysplastic/pre-malignant Clone with Monosomy 7 with pathophysiology like that of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with known genetic markers in the tumour cells. We used random start controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) leading to oocyte collection and vitrification of metaphase II oocytes. Despite successful COS and vitrification, there remain numerous ethical considerations that merit more focussed discussion. Not least, in determining best practice for informed consent, but consideration of individualised protocols for ovarian stimulation, monitoring follicular development, together with prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) when considering most appropriate trigger for oocyte maturation. Random-start controlled ovarian stimulation and oocyte vitrification for adolescent girls diagnosed with cancer can be safely achieved through a collaborative, multidisciplinary and expert team approach. This case study offers a promising approach to fertility preservation, and would minimise the risk of introducing malignant cells after recovery.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Fertility preservation', 'adolescence', 'childhood cancer']",,"['Chromosome 7, monosomy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doxycycline-dependent switching can be tracked via fluorescent markers coupled to constitutive and tetracycline-regulated GOIs. This article describes transduction of murine primary HPCs with different doses of multimodal LVs, distinct cytokine conditions, and their influence on the number and viability of cells co-expressing both collaborating GOIs upon doxycycline induction. A 2-week protocol is provided for multimodal LV production, titer determination, and evaluation of tetracycline responsive promoter background activity in a murine fibroblast cell line. The power of this model to assess the dose/time/order-controlled contribution of single and multiple genes into hematopoietic networks opens new routes in reprogramming, stem cell, and leukemia biology.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*constitutive and tetracycline-regulated', '*fate tracking', '*genetic modification of HSCs and HPCs', '*lentiviral vectors']",,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",PMC5568180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has improved clinical outcome, most ALL patients relapse following treatment with TKI due to the development of resistance. We developed an in vitro model of Nilotinib-resistant Ph+ leukemia cells to investigate whether low dose radiation (LDR) in combination with TKI therapy overcome chemo-resistance. Additionally, we developed a mathematical model, parameterized by cell viability experiments under Nilotinib treatment and LDR, to explain the cellular response to combination therapy. The addition of LDR significantly reduced drug resistance both in vitro and in computational model. Decreased expression level of phosphorylated AKT suggests that the combination treatment plays an important role in overcoming resistance through the AKT pathway. Model-predicted cellular responses to the combined therapy provide good agreement with experimental results.

Given the important role of apoptosis in cataract development, the aim of this study was to investigate whether Smac induces human lens epithelial cell (HLEC) apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). METHODS: Smac expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in anterior lens capsules from 157 patients with age-related cataracts and 5 normal controls. The role of Smac in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced ERS and apoptosis was further evaluated using small interfering RNA knockdown in an HLEC line. RESULTS: Notably, Smac expression was significantly higher in patients with cataracts than in controls, but showed no association with cataract severity. Cell survival was inversely correlated with H2O2 concentration, and was most significantly affected at 200 mumol/L. Moreover, flow cytometry revealed that Smac knockdown attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis and enhanced apoptotic- and endoplasmic reticulum-related marker expression-including that of glucose-regulated protein 78, C/EBP homologous protein, caspase 3, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2-associated X, and BCL2-at the gene and protein level.

We performed the initial analytic performance evaluation of a novel competitive template-based peripheral blood b2a2/b3a2 transcript abundance method, called standardized nucleic acid quantification (SNAQ) test, with hypothesis that this will produced more consistent results with less frequent interlaboratory variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated at our institution were enrolled. We compared SNAQ test with 2 laboratory developed test at the MD Anderson molecular diagnostic laboratory and Cancer Genetics Institute for analyzing BCR-ABL1 from peripheral blood samples. Each test result (n=36) was ranked against all the other samples tested by the same method. RESULTS: The Pearson correlation between SNAQ and laboratory developed test done at 2 labs was met by correlations of 0.97, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.94. Analysis of variance of log %BCR-ABL1 interlaboratory results indicated no significant difference (P=0.98). Post hoc analysis of method agreement showed the SNAQ method had a 95% limit of agreement of +/-3-fold between laboratories.

Epub 2017 Jul 7.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating malignancy for which novel treatment approaches are desperately needed. Ras signaling is an attractive therapeutic target for AML because a large proportion of AMLs have mutations in NRAS, KRAS, or genes that activate Ras signaling, and key Ras effectors are activated in virtually all AML patient samples. This has inspired efforts to develop Ras-targeted treatment strategies for AML. Due to the inherent difficulty and disappointing efficacy of targeting Ras proteins directly, many have focused on inhibiting Ras effector pathways. Inhibiting the major oncogenic Ras effectors, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or phosphatidylinositiol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, has generally demonstrated modest efficacy for AML. While this may be in part related to functional redundancy between these pathways, it is now clear that other Ras effectors have key oncogenic roles. Specifically, the Ras-like (Ral) GTPases have emerged as critical mediators of Ras-driven transformation and AML cell survival. Our group recently uncovered a critical role for RALB signaling in leukemic cell survival and a potential mediator of relapse following Ras-targeted therapy in AML. Furthermore, we found that RALB signaling is hyperactivated in AML patient samples, and inhibiting RALB has potent anti-leukemic activity in preclinical AML models. While key questions remain regarding the importance of RALB signaling across the genetically diverse spectrum of AML, the specific mechanism(s) that promotes leukemic cell survival downstream of RALB, and how to pharmacologically target RALB signaling effectively - RALB has emerged as a critical Ras effector and potential therapeutic target for AML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MAPK', '*PI3K', '*RALB', '*Ral', '*Ras', '*targeted therapy']",,"['EC 3.6.5.2 (ral GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",PMC6959283,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7690-3570', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2834-0421']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from other mutations, T315I is especially challenging as it confers resistance to all first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. So, a thorough study of altered behavior upon mutation is crucially needed. To understand the resistance mechanism of mutant BCR-ABL protein, we organized a long-term molecular dynamics simulation (500 ns) and performed the detailed comparative conformational analysis. We found that due to mutation at 315th position (threonine to isoleucine), original structures deviated from normal, and attained a flexible conformation. Our observations pave a clear path toward designing new inhibitors against resistant BCR-ABL1 protein and suggest a strategy where additional flexibility governed by mutation could be given an appropriate consideration.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL protein', '*dynamics simulation', '*flexibility', '*mutation']",,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0752-7780'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 23.,"Metformin (MET) is the drug of choice for patients with type 2 diabetes and has been proposed for use in cancer therapy and for treating other metabolic diseases. More than 14,000 studies have been published addressing the cellular mechanisms affected by MET. However, several in vitro studies have used concentrations of the drug 10-100-fold higher than the plasmatic concentration measured in patients. Here, we evaluated the biochemical, metabolic, and morphologic effects of various concentrations of MET. Moreover, we tested the effect of MET on Fanconi Anemia (FA) cells, a DNA repair genetic disease with defects in energetic and glucose metabolism, as well as on human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cell lines. We found that the response of wild-type cells to MET is concentration dependent. Low concentrations (15 and 150 microM) increase both oxidative phosphorylation and the oxidative stress response, acting on the AMPK/Sirt1 pathway, while the high concentration (1.5 mM) inhibits the respiratory chain, alters cell morphology, becoming toxic to the cells. In FA cells, MET was unable to correct the energetic/respiratory defect and did not improve the response to oxidative stress and DNA damage. By contrast, HL60 cells appear sensitive also at 150 muM. Our findings underline the importance of the MET concentration in evaluating the effect of this drug on cell metabolism and demonstrate that data obtained from in vitro experiments, that have used high concentrations of MET, cannot be readily translated into improving our understanding of the cellular effects of metformin when used in the clinical setting.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia', 'cancerogenesis', 'energetic metabolism', 'metformin', 'oxidative stress']",,"['9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5910-9260'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is believed that bile acid accumulation is associated with liver tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism that underpins this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Mcl-1, which is overexpressed in hepatic cells, is a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family. In this study, we observed that Mcl-1 potently suppresses the repair of bile acid-induced abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites in DNA lesions. Upon exposure of hepatic cells to glycochenodeoxycholate, one of the major conjugated human bile acids, we observed an increase in AP site accumulation along with induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and XRCC1 ( X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 1). In addition, accumulation of Mcl-1 was observed in the nuclei of QGY-7703 cells in response to glycochenodeoxycholate stimulation. Knockdown of endogenous Mcl-1 by RNA interference significantly accelerated the repair of DNA lesions in glycochenodeoxycholate-treated cells. However, unlike XRCC1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was induced following Mcl-1 knockdown. Conversely, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suppression was observed following glycochenodeoxycholate treatment of cells overexpressing Mcl-1. Moreover, AP-site counting analyses revealed that DNA repair activity was enhanced in cells overexpressing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase under glycochenodeoxycholate stress conditions. It is well known that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase plays a crucial role in the base excision repair pathway. Thus, our findings suggest that Mcl-1 suppresses base excision repair by inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase induction following glycochenodeoxycholate-induced DNA damage.

METHODS: Patients (>/= 18 years) with >/=1 inpatient or >/=2 outpatient CML diagnoses were identified from the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2007-June 30, 2015). CML patients were grouped into two study cohorts, those with evidence of disease progression to the blast phase and those without. Patients were required to have continuous medical and prescription coverage during a 12-month baseline period, in which demographics and clinical characteristics were evaluated. All-cause healthcare resource utilization and costs were evaluated during the baseline period, and a variable follow-up period, lasting >/=1 day and up to 1 year. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to compare the incremental costs of CML patients with vs without progression. RESULTS: Of the overall study population, 587 (7%) experienced disease progression and 7,504 (93%) did not. On the index date, of patients with progression, approximately 31% were treated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant and 69% with chemotherapy. During the baseline period, mean total healthcare costs, including costs for hospitalizations and outpatient costs, were significantly greater for CML patients with progression as compared to those without progression ($143,778 vs $53,143, p < .001). During the follow-up, mean total healthcare costs, costs for hospitalizations, and outpatient medical service costs were substantially greater for patients with progression as compared to those without progression; however, costs for outpatient prescriptions were less for patients who progressed. When patient characteristics were controlled for, mean incremental 1-year cost for CML patients with vs without progression was $270,925 (confidence interval = $235,290-$311,958, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare burden, in terms of healthcare resource utilization and costs, of patients with CML progression is substantial.

Epub 2017 Jul 6.,"Tumor suppressor p53 and proto-oncogene survivin are challenging targets for anticancer drugs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which are associated with chemoresistance. Yet, no p53 and survivin-modulating drug with low toxicity and high efficacy has been approved for clinical application in ALL. Consequently, the search for novel compounds which target p53 or survivin is needed to further advance ALL treatment. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite of Serratia marcescens induces apoptosis in cancer cells with no toxicity on normal cells. However, the possible potential of prodigiosin as p53- and survivin-modulating agent in ALL cells has not been investigated. Wt-p53 Molt-4 cells were treated with 100 to 600 nM prodigiosin, after which, viability, cell proliferation rates, survivin and p53 protein levels, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis were evaluated. After 24-, 48-, and 72-h treatments with 100 to 600 nM prodigiosin, cell proliferation rates were measured to be 93.7-77.3%, 75.5-58.3%, and 55-23.3%, respectively. Treatment for 48 hours with 100 to 600 nM prodigiosin resulted in 41-19% decrease in survivin protein levels followed by 450-950% increases in caspase-3 activation levels. Prodigiosin induced remarkably p53 accumulation and increased p53/survivin and caspase-3/survivin ratios by 6.1 to 11.3 and 10.3 to 47.5-fold at 100 to 600 nM, respectively. Survivin protein levels were inversely proportional to p53 accumulation levels. Low survivin protein levels combined with high levels of p53 accumulation were correlated to higher apoptotic rates. P53 and survivin as molecular targets of prodigiosin contribute to caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in ALL cells and this compound represents an attractive p53- and survivin-modulating agent in ALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['P53', 'Serratia marcescens', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'caspase-3', 'cell proliferation', 'prodigiosin', 'survivin']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'OL369FU7CJ (Prodigiosin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 6.,"Smoking has been identified as a significant risk factor for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, epidemiological evidence for the effect of smoking on the risk of AML among Asians is scarce. Here, we investigated the impact of smoking habits on the risk of AML by conducting a pooled analysis of 9 population-based prospective cohort studies in Japan. We analysed original data on smoking habits at baseline from 9 cohort studies. Hazard ratios (HRs) in the individual studies were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for potential confounders and combined using a random-effects model. During 4 808 175 person-years of follow-up for a total of 344 676 participants (165 567 men and 179 109 women), 245 AML cases (139 men and 106 women) were identified. For both sexes combined, current smokers had a marginally significant increased risk of AML compared to never smokers (HR = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-2.14). Ever smokers with more than 30 pack-years had a statistically significant increased risk of AML compared to never smokers among both sexes combined (HR = 1.66, 95% CI, 1.06-2.63). By sex, this significant association was observed only among men, with an HR of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.00-2.87) for ever smokers with more than 30 pack-years relative to never smokers. In conclusion, this study confirmed that cigarette smoking increases the risk of AML in Japanese. This study provides important evidence that smoking increases the risk of AML among Asians, which has already been shown in Western populations.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'cohort studies', 'pooled analysis', 'smoking']",,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1761-6314', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1276-2398']","['Research Group for the Development and Evaluation of Cancer Prevention Strategies', 'in Japan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid, specific and sensitive test for the timely accuracy in immunocompromised patients to reduce mortality rates and prevent IC progress is necessary. We established a real-time PCR assay on blood for the diagnosis and differentiation of the causative Candida species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole blood samples were collected twice, from 72 patients for Real Time PCR and blood culture assays. The primers and hybridization probes were designed to potentiate the specific sequence of 18S rRNA genes using Light Cycler system and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FERT). The patients with hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplant recipients were evaluated for IC based on the revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/ Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2011, 72 patients with hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplant recipients were evaluated for IC. The female to male ratio was 27:45; the mean age was 32.1 years. The most common malignancy in this patient was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (27.8%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (26.4%). Out of 72 patients, 11 patients (15.3%) had positive real time PCR /probe results. Based on the melting temperature (Tm) analysis, 5 (45.4%) C. krusei, 3 (27.2%) C. tropicalis, 2 (18.1%) C. parapsilosis and 1 C. albicans (9%) were identified. According to the revised EORTC / MSG, 1 patient (9%) and 10 patients (91%) were defined as proven and possible groups of IC, respectively. The mortality rate in proven and possible IC patient was found 54.5%. CONCLUSION: The established Real-time PCR/FRET probe assay is an appropriate diagnostic tool for the detection of Candida species DNA and the management of patients suffering from hematologic malignancies and bone marrow recipient are at risk for IC.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Candida', 'Real-Time PCR', 'hematological malignancy', 'identification', 'invasive']",,,PMC5490320,,,,,,['The authors state no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jan 27.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially those with relapsed or refractory AML, have poor clinical prognosis and outcomes. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments have become increasingly important in oncology, aiding in identifying and informing supportive therapy needs during treatment and beyond; however, HRQoL in hematology, and AML in particular, has received relatively minor attention. The aim was to identify and summarize estimates of HRQoL in patients with AML, including patients with relapsed or refractory AML. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature published between 2004 and 2014 in the US and Europe. Abstracts from four relevant conference proceedings between 2012 and 2014 were reviewed. Data from eligible studies were extracted describing the HRQoL instruments used, domains assessed, and HRQoL scores reported. RESULTS: Fourteen peer-reviewed studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Cancer- or leukemia-specific HRQoL measures were used in 78.6% of the studies. Overall, HRQoL was superior among AML survivors compared to individuals on active treatment. Fatigue was identified as the most problematic symptom domain in patients, irrespective of their treatment status. Reported HRQoL declined shortly after diagnosis or treatment initiation and recovered over time. CONCLUSION: The included studies identified a decrease in HRQoL after treatment initiation and highlighted the role of fatigue in HRQoL in this patient population. Limited HRQoL data were identified among relapsed or refractory AML patients although they have worse prognostic outcomes. New treatment options that have less negative impact on HRQoL or health initiatives specifically targeting HRQoL of patients with AML are warranted. In addition, further studies exploring HRQoL in the relapsed or refractory patient population are needed to inform disease management and treatment decisions.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Systematic literature review']",,,PMC5488112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified cellular and molecular factors provided by the splenic marginal zone (MZ), which alter the migratory and adhesive behavior of leukemic cells. We used the Cxcr5(-/-)Emicro-Tcl1 leukemia mouse model, in which tumor cells are excluded from B cell follicles and instead accumulate within the MZ. Genes involved in MZ B cell development and genes encoding for adhesion molecules were upregulated in MZ-localized Cxcr5(-/-)Emicro-Tcl1 cells. Likewise, surface expression of the adhesion and homing molecules, CD49d/VLA-4 and CXCR7, and of NOTCH2 was increased. In vitro, exposing Emicro-Tcl1 cells or human CLL cells to niche-specific stimuli, like B cell receptor- or Toll-like receptor ligands, caused surface expression of these molecules characteristic for a follicular or MZ-like microenvironment, respectively. In vivo, inhibition of VLA-4-mediated adhesion and CXCL13-mediated follicular homing displaced leukemic cells not only from the follicle, but also from the MZ and reduced leukemia progression. We conclude that MZ-specific factors shape the phenotype of leukemic cells and facilitate their niche-specific retention. This strong microenvironmental influence gains pathogenic significance independent from tumor-specific genetic aberrations.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adhesion molecules', '*B cell leukemia', '*chemokine receptors', '*marginal zone', '*toll-like receptor signaling', '*tumor microenvironment']",,,PMC5486190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their success in lymphoblastic leukemia, solid tumors have been more recalcitrant. Identifying therapeutic barriers facing CAR-modified (CART) or BsAb-redirected T (BsAb-T) cells should facilitate their clinical translation to solid tumors. Novel lentiviral vectors containing low-affinity or high-affinity 4-1BB second-generation anti-GD2 (disialoganglioside) CARs were built to achieve efficient T cell transduction. The humanized anti-GD2 x CD3 BsAb using the IgG-scFv platform was described previously. CART and BsAb-engaged T cells were tested for viability, proliferation, and activation/exhaustion marker expression, and in vitro cytotoxicity against GD2(+) tumor cells. The antitumor effect of CAR-grafted and BsAb-T cells was compared in a human melanoma xenograft model. The majority of high CAR density T cells were depleted upon exposure to GD2(+) target cells while the BsAb-T cells survived. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the surviving CART cells was inferior to that of the BsAb-T cells. Using low-affinity CARs, inclusion of the 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain or exclusion of a co-stimulatory domain, or blocking PD1 did not prevent CART cell depletion. Both CART cells and BsAb-T cells penetrated established subcutaneous human melanoma xenografts; while both induced tumor regression, BsAb was more efficient. The fate of T cells activated by BsAb differs substantially from that by CAR, translating into a more robust antitumor effect both in vitro and in vivo.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bispecific antibody', '*T cell exhaustion', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*disialoganglioside', '*immunotherapy']",,,PMC5486173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the role of memory NK cells in cancer has so far remained elusive and adoptive NK cell transfer in relapsing pediatric acute B cell precursor leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients awaits improvement, we asked the question whether tumor-priming could promote the generation of memory NK cells with enhanced graft-vs.-leukemia (GvL) reactivity. Here, we provide substantial evidence that priming of naive human NK cells with pediatric acute B cell leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia specimens induces a functional conversion to tumor-induced memory-like (TIML)-NK cells displaying a heightened tumor-specific cytotoxicity and enhanced perforin synthesis. Cell cycles analyses reveal that tumor-priming sustainably alters the balance between NK cell activation and apoptosis in favor of survival. In addition, gene expression patterns differ between TIML- and cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)-NK cells with the magnitude of regulated genes being distinctly higher in TIML-NK cells. As such, the tumor-induced conversion of NK cells triggers the emergence of a so far unacknowledged NK cell differentiation stage that might promote GvL effects in the context of adoptive cell transfer.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute B cell precursor leukemia', '*adoptive cell transfer', '*children', '*natural killer cells']",,,PMC5486172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 May 8.,"The number of patients with hematological malignancies who develop invasive fungal disease (IFD) has increased dramatically in recent decades. This increase is attributed to impairment of the host immune system due to intensive cytotoxic chemotherapies, use of corticosteroids and profound immunosuppression after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Additionally, the increasing prevalence of fungal infections caused by emerging and rare pathogens, IFD of mixed etiology or of atypical localization is observed. There are also much more patients with IFD who do not belong to a well-described risk group, like patient with lymphoproliferative disorders. Within this heterogeneous group of patients, IFD epidemiology is not well defined and antifungal prophylaxis practices vary. The aim of this paper is to present the case of a 58-year-old patient with refractory Hodgkin disease, focusing on infectious complication after subsequent lines of chemotherapy. During deep and prolonged neutropaenia the patient developed symptoms of pneumonia. Despite antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole, IFD of mixed etiology with the presence of Candida glabrata and Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed. The infection showed a poor response to monotherapy with liposomal amphotericin B, but was successfully treated with therapy involving micafungin. Analysis of the presented case demonstrated the necessity of new approaches to the prevention of IFD in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders heavily pretreated with numerous chemotherapy protocols. Prolonged neutropenia and high corticosteroid exposure put these patients in high risk of IFD like patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome or after allogeneic HSCT.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Candidiasis', 'aspergillosis', 'invasive fungal disease', 'micafungin']",,,PMC5470606,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike its established role in other hematological malignancies like Hodgkin's on non-Hodgkin's disease, the exact role of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in AML with or without GS remains to be defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed PET/CT scans of 12 patients with histologically proven GS. Marrow examination of these patients identified nine patients with isolated GS (without existent leukemia) and three patients with coexistent leukemia. RESULTS: PET/CT accurately identified all clinically evident GS in all 12 patients at initial staging and at follow-up with tumors, showing moderate to high 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose uptake. Coexistent marrow disease was seen on PET/CT in three patients, which was confirmed on histopathology. In the same patients, PET/CT also detected additional sites of extramedullary disease in 66.6% (n = 8), which was either clinically occult or not evident on routine CT. CONCLUSION: PET/CT appears to be a highly sensitive imaging modality in diagnostic evaluation of GS. The most important indication of using PET/CT in these cases is to identify additional sites of clinically occult extramedullary disease, which can potentially impact treatment decisions and outcomes.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FDG', 'PET/CT', 'granulocytic', 'leukemia', 'myeloid', 'sarcoma']",,,PMC5482015,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear how leukemia cells alter the BM microenvironment to create a hospitable niche. Here, we report that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, but not normal CD34+ or CD33+ cells, induce osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In addition, AML cells inhibited adipogenic differentiation of MSCs. Mechanistic studies identified that AML-derived BMPs activate Smad1/5 signaling to induce osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. Gene expression array analysis revealed that AML cells induce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression in BM-MSCs irrespective of AML type. Overexpression of CTGF in a transgenic mouse model greatly enhanced leukemia engraftment in vivo. Together, our data suggest that AML cells induce a preosteoblast-rich niche in the BM that in turn enhances AML expansion.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone Biology', 'Stem cells']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC5499365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 5.,"Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that most commonly affects adults and is driven by a high frequency of mutations in BRAF, MAP2K1, and kinases promoting MAPK signaling. Because of the relative rarity of ECD, key clinical features of the disease may not be well defined. Across a multi-institutional cohort of 189 patients with ECD and ECD overlapping with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (so-called mixed histiocytosis [MH]), we identified an unexpected and heretofore undescribed frequent occurrence of myeloid neoplasms among patients with ECD and MH. Some 10.1% (19/189) of patients with ECD have an overlapping myeloid neoplasm, most commonly occurring as a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or mixed MDS/MPN overlap syndrome (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Consistent with this, molecular analysis frequently detected hallmark driver mutations of myeloid neoplasms (such as JAK2V617F and CALR mutations) coexisting with those characteristic of histiocytosis (such as BRAFV600E and MAP2K1 mutations). Histiocytosis patients diagnosed with a concomitant myeloid malignancy were significantly older at diagnosis and more commonly presented with MH than those without a myeloid malignancy. In some cases, the presence of distinct kinase mutations in the histiocytosis and myeloid neoplasm resulted in discordant and adverse responses to kinase-directed targeted therapies. These data highlight the clinical importance of evaluating adults with histiocytosis for a concomitant myeloid neoplasm.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['R01 CA201247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA160647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL128239/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL127672/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA188529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC5570678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 4.,"Long non-coding RNAs are defined as transcripts larger than 200 nucleotides but without protein-coding potential. There is growing evidence of the important role of long non-coding RNAs in cancer initiation, development and progression. In this study, we sought to evaluate the long non-coding RNA expression profile of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RNA-sequencing of 40 cytogenetically normal AML patients allowed us to quantify 11,036 long non-coding RNAs. Among these, more than 8000 were previously undescribed long non-coding RNAs. Using unsupervised analysis, we observed a specific long non-coding RNA expression profile dependent on the mutational status of the NPM1 gene. Statistical analysis allowed us to identify a minimal set of 12 long non-coding RNAs capable of discriminating NPM1-mutated from NPM1-wild-type patients. These results were validated by qRT-PCR on an independent cohort composed of 134 cytogenetically normal AML patients. Furthermore, we have identified one putative biomarker, the long non-coding RNA XLOC_109948 whose expression pattern predicts clinical outcome. Interestingly, low XLOC_109948 expression indicates a good prognosis especially for NPM1-mutated patients. Transient transfection of GapmeR against XLOC_109948 in NPM1-mutated OCI-AML3 cell line treated with Ara-C or ATRA enhances apoptosis suggesting XLOC_109948 plays a role in drug sensitivity. This study improves our knowledge of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We observed a distinct long non-coding RNA expression profile in patients with the NPM1 mutation. The newly identified XLOC_109948 long non-coding RNA emerged as a strong prognostic factor able to better stratify NPM1-mutated patients.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",PMC5622856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By clearly resolving phylogenic relationships, we uncovered mutated LCP1 and WNK1 as novel CLL drivers, supported by functional evidence demonstrating their impact on CLL pathways. Integrative analysis of somatic mutations with transcriptional states prompts the idea that convergent evolution generates phenotypically similar cells in distinct genetic branches, thus creating a cohesive expression profile in each CLL sample despite the presence of genetic heterogeneity.

Epub 2017 Jul 6.,"The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a major breakthrough in the field of cancer therapeutics. Pursuant to their success in melanoma and numerous solid tumor malignancies, these agents are being investigated in hematological malignancies including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although AML/MDS have traditionally been considered to be less immunogenic than solid tumor malignancies, recent pre-clinical models suggest a therapeutic role for immune checkpoint inhibition in these diseases. CTLA-4 inhibition may be especially effective in treating late post-allogeneic stem cell transplant relapse of AML in patients with limited or no graft versus host disease. Immune checkpoint inhibition, specifically PD-1 inhibition, demonstrated limited single agent efficacy in patients with relapsed AML and with MDS post-hypomethylating therapy. Rationally designed combinations of PD-1 inhibitors with standard anti-leukemic therapy are needed. Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, up-regulate PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in patients with AML/MDS and up-regulation of these genes was associated with the emergence of resistance. The combination of azacitidine and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition may be a potential mechanism to prevent or overcome resistance to 5-azacitidine. A number of such combinations are being evaluated in clinical trials with early encouraging results. Immune checkpoint inhibition is also an attractive option to improve relapse-free survival or eliminate minimal residual disease post induction and consolidation by enhancing T-cell surveillance in patients with high-risk AML. The ongoing clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors in AML/MDS will improve our understanding of the immunobiology of these diseases and guide us to the most appropriate application of these agents in the therapy of AML/MDS.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Checkpoint inhibitors', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*immunotherapy', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Costimulatory and Inhibitory T-Cell Receptors)']",PMC5872841,['NIHMS951513'],,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9408-5882'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we followed up and validated the relevance of SH3BGRL expression to AML progression in 116 cases. Results showed that SH3BGRL is down-regulated in 62.37% AML cases with poor prognosis. Cases with positive response to therapy accompanies with SH3GRL expression restoration. Mechanistically, SH3BGRL down-regulation promotes AML cell cycle progression and enhances the anti-apoptotic ability to drug cytotoxicity. While ectopic SH3BGRL blocks AML cell cycle and proliferation to sensitize them to therapeutic drugs via apoptosis. Xenograft assays further confirmed the suppressive role of SH3BGRL in leukemogenesis.

However, there is little evidence related to hematopoietic recovery in non-transplantation settings, which is accomplished by endogenous hematopoietic cells. A recent study suggested that progenitors are the main contributors during this steady-state hematopoiesis, which differs from exogenous transplantation. We hypothesized that endogenous progenitor support post-chemotherapy hematopoietic recovery. To investigate the potential impact of these progenitor cell percentage on hematopoietic recovery, we retrospectively analyzed the percentage of CD34+CD38+CD117+HLA-DR+CD13+CD33+ cells (P cells) and hematopoietic recovery in 223 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients during two courses of consolidation chemotherapy after complete remission. We found that a lower P cell percentage was significantly associated with prolonged neutropenia recovery time after the first and second courses of consolidation chemotherapy (p = 0.001; p = 0.045, respectively). We also observed similar results with regard to platelet recovery time after the first course of consolidation chemotherapy (p = 0.000). Univariate analysis showed that P cell percentage and consolidation chemotherapy regimens, and not gender, age, induction chemotherapy regimens, infection grade, WHO classification and NCCN risk category, were associated with neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that P cell percentage is an independent factor affecting neutrophil recovery capacity for both the first and second courses (p = 0.008; p = 0.032, respectively). Our results indicate that CD34+CD38+CD117+HLA-DR+CD13+CD33+ cells before each course of chemotherapy is independently associated with chemotherapy-related hematopoietic reconstitution capacity.

However, a significant fraction of patients develop resistance, commonly due to mutated ABL1 kinase domains. This motivated development of second-generation drugs with broadened or altered protein kinase selectivity profiles, including dasatinib and nilotinib. Imatinib-resistant patients undergoing treatment with second-line drugs typically develop resistance to them, but dynamic and clonal properties of this response differ. Shared, however, is the observation of clonal competition, reflected in patterns of successive dominance of individual clones. We present three deterministic mathematical models to study the origins of clinically observed dynamics. Each model is a system of coupled first-order differential equations, considering populations of three mutated active stem cell strains and three associated pools of differentiated cells; two models allow for activation of quiescent stem cells. Each approach is distinguished by the way proliferation rates of the primary stem cell reservoir are modulated. Previous studies have concentrated on simulating the response of wild-type leukemic cells to imatinib administration; our focus is on modelling the time dependence of imatinib-resistant clones upon subsequent exposure to dasatinib or nilotinib. Performance of the three computational schemes to reproduce selected CML patient profiles is assessed. While some simple cases can be approximated by a basic design that does not invoke quiescence, others are more complex and require involvement of non-cycling stem cells for reproduction. We implement a new feedback mechanism for regulation of coupling between cycling and non-cycling stem cell reservoirs that depends on total cell populations. A bifurcation landscape analysis is also performed for solutions to the basic ansatz. Computational models reproducing patient data illustrate potential dynamic mechanisms that may guide optimization of therapy of drug resistant CML.",,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC5497988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adhesion signaling pathways have been extensively studied in adherent cells as well as in mature haematopoietic cells, but the adhesion structures and signaling in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, either normal or malignant, are much less explored. We analyzed the interaction of leukemia cells with fibronectin (FN) using interference reflection microscopy, immunofluorescence, measurement of adherent cell fraction, real-time microimpedance measurement and live cell imaging. We found that leukemia cells form very dynamic adhesion structures similar to early stages of focal adhesions. In contrast to adherent cells, where Src family kinases (SFK) belong to important regulators of focal adhesion dynamics, we observed only minor effects of SFK inhibitor dasatinib on leukemia cell binding to FN. The relatively weak involvement of SFK in adhesion structure regulation might be associated with the lack of cytoskeletal mechanical tension in leukemia cells. On the other hand, active Lyn kinase was found to specifically localize to leukemia cell adhesion structures and a less firm cell attachment to FN was often associated with higher Lyn activity (this unexpectedly occurred also after cell treatment with the inhibitor SKI-1). Lyn thus may be important for signaling from integrin-associated complexes to other processes in leukemia cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ECIS', '*Lyn', '*Src family kinases', '*adhesion', '*hematopoietic cell', '*leukemia']",,"['0 (Fibronectins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC6149513,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9628-6255'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Leukemia is a type of hematopoietic stem cell malignant cloned disease with high mortality. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is one of the most common treatments for leukemia. Similar to other chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin resistance has become a serious issue in cancer therapy. In the present study, we investigated the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin in murine leukemia L1210 cells. Firstly, the L1210 cell line resistant to cisplatin (L1210/DDP) was established. Compared to its parental cell line, the IC50 value of cisplatin in the L1210/DDP cells was increased 10-fold. Mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2), mitochondrial outer membrane fusion proteins, were markedly upregulated in the L1210/DDP cells, whereas the expression of fission protein Drp1 and inner membrane fusion protein OPA1 were not significantly altered. In addition, mitofusins were also upregulated in the parental L1210 cells subjected to cisplatin stress. To investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin, the effect of mitochondrial division inhibitor (Mdivi)-1 on cisplatininduced cell death, caspase-3 cleavage and ROS production was examined in L1210 cells. We found that 5 microM of Mdivi-1 efficiently attenuated cisplatin-induced cell death, caspase activation and intracellular ROS increase in L1210 cells. Our data indicated that mitochondrial dynamics play an important role in the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin, and mitofusin-mediated mitochondrial fusion may be involved in the process of cisplatin resistance in leukemia cells. Therefore, the present study revealed that mitochondrial dynamics may be a potential target used to improve the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin in leukemia in the future.",,,,,"['0 (3-(2,4-dichloro-5-methoxyphenyl)-2-sulfanyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quercetin was found to induce the apoptosis of all the tested cancer cell lines at the utilized concentrations. Moreover, quercetin significantly induced the apoptosis of the CT26, LNCaP, MOLT4 and Raji cell lines, as compared to control group (P<0.001), as demonstrated by Annexin V/PI staining. In in vivo experiments, mice bearing MCF7 and CT26 tumors exhibited a significant reduction in tumor volume in the quercetintreated group as compared to the control group (P<0.001).

Mice were divided into control, WEHI3 control, acetic acid (vehicle)treated, and 5 and 20 mg/kg chitosantreated groups. Mice were subsequently weighed, blood was collected, and liver and spleen samples were isolated and weighed. Blood samples were measured for cell markers, the spleen underwent phagocytosis and natural killer (NK) cell activity examination, and cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry. Chitosan did not significantly affect the weights of body, liver and spleen at 5 and 20 mg/kg treatment. Chitosan increased the percentage of CD3 (T cells marker), decreased the levels of CD19 (Bcell marker) and CD11b at 5 mg/kg treatment, and decreased the levels of Mac3 at 5 and 20 mg/kg treatment. Chitosan significantly increased macrophage phagocytosis of PBMCs, but did not significantly affect macrophage phagocytosis in the peritoneal cavity. Chitosan treatment did not significantly affect the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, and also did not affect T- and B-cell proliferation. Chitosan significantly increased total white blood cell numbers, and GOT and GPT activities were both significantly increased.

Samples from 2 jaguars ( Panthera onca) and 1 oncilla ( Leopardus tigrinus) were positive for FHV-1; 2 jaguars, 1 puma ( Puma concolor), and 1 jaguarundi ( Herpairulus yagouaroundi) tested positive for CPPV-1; and 1 puma was positive for FIV. Based on comparison of 103 nucleotides of the UL24-UL25 gene, the FHV-1 sequences were 99-100% similar to the FHV-1 strain of domestic cats. Nucleotide sequences of CPPV-1 were closely related to sequences detected in other wild carnivores, comparing 294 nucleotides of the VP1 gene. The FIV nucleotide sequence detected in the free-ranging puma, based on comparison of 444 nucleotides of the pol gene, grouped with other lentiviruses described in pumas, and had 82.4% identity with a free-ranging puma from Yellowstone Park and 79.5% with a captive puma from Brazil.

Epub 2017 Jul 4.,"Many commonly used statistical methods for data analysis or clinical trial design rely on incorrect assumptions or assume an over-simplified framework that ignores important information. Such statistical practices may lead to incorrect conclusions about treatment effects or clinical trial designs that are impractical or that do not accurately reflect the investigator's goals. Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models and methods are a very flexible new class of statistical tools that can overcome such limitations. This is because BNP models can accurately approximate any distribution or function and can accommodate a broad range of statistical problems, including density estimation, regression, survival analysis, graphical modeling, neural networks, classification, clustering, population models, forecasting and prediction, spatiotemporal models, and causal inference. This paper describes 3 illustrative applications of BNP methods, including a randomized clinical trial to compare treatments for intraoperative air leaks after pulmonary resection, estimating survival time with different multi-stage chemotherapy regimes for acute leukemia, and evaluating joint effects of targeted treatment and an intermediate biological outcome on progression-free survival time in prostate cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bayesian nonparametric statistics', '*clinical trial design', '*density estimation', '*dynamic treatment regime', '*targeted therapy']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC5681362,['NIHMS883603'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7293-529X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 4.,"Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), a rare lymphoid malignancy with a high mortality rate, is caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Due to its rarity and poor prognosis, ocular manifestations have yet to be well documented. The mechanisms that underlie ocular involvement in ATL patients, thus, remain poorly understood. We report the first successfully tracked case of ocular inflammation (i.e., uveitis) that developed simultaneously in conjunction with a rapid increase in ATL cells. Our findings for this case suggest that a rapid increase in ATL cells contributed to the disruption of the blood-ocular barrier, which may, thus, represent one mechanism underlying the induction of uveitis in ATL patients. Furthermore, with the development of novel therapies, the longer survival times of ATL patients have raised new issues, such as quality of vision in ATL patients. Hematologists should be aware that a rapid increase in the number of ATL cells may cause adult T-cell leukemia cell-induced uveitis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', 'Blood-ocular barrier', 'Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'Ocular inflammation', 'Uveitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most MM patients ultimately experience PI-refractory disease, an unmet medical need with poorly understood biology and dismal outcome. Pharmacologic targeting of ABCB1 improved patient outcomes, including MM, but suffered from adverse drug effects and insufficient plasma concentrations. Proteomics analysis identified ABCB1 overexpression as the most significant change in CFZ-resistant MM cells. We addressed the functional role of ABCB1 overexpression in MM and observed significantly upregulated ABCB1 in peripheral blood malignant plasma cells (PCs) vs untreated patients' bone marrow PC. ABCB1 overexpression reduces the proteasome-inhibiting activity of CFZ due to drug efflux, in contrast to BTZ. Likewise, the cytotoxicity of established anti-MM drugs was significantly reduced in ABCB1-expressing MM cells. In search for potential drugs targeting ABCB1 in clinical trials, we identified the HIV protease inhibitors nelfinavir (NFV) and lopinavir (LPV) as potent functional modulators of ABCB1-mediated drug export, most likely via modulation of mitochondria permeability transition pore.

Recently, we reported spontaneous immune responses against the CALR mutations. Here, we describe that CALR-mutant (CALRmut)-specific T cells are able to specifically recognize CALRmut cells. First, we established a T-cell culture specific for a CALRmut epitope. These specific T cells were able to recognize several epitopes in the CALRmut C terminus. Next, we established a CALRmut-specific CD4(+) T-cell clone by limiting dilution. These CD4(+) T cells recognized autologous CALRmut monocytes and hematopoietic stem cells, and T-cell recognition of target cells was dependent on the presence of CALR. Furthermore, we showed that the CALRmut response was human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR restricted. Finally, we demonstrated that the CALRmut-specific CD4(+) T cells, despite their phenotype, were cytotoxic to autologous CALRmut cells, and that the cytotoxicity was mediated by degranulation of the T cells. In conclusion, the CALR exon 9 mutations are targets for specific T cells and thus are promising targets for cancer immune therapy such as peptide vaccination in patients harboring CALR exon 9 mutations.",,,,,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4731-4969'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the utility of an open source variant caller in detecting large indels in a targeted sequencing of AML samples. While we found that this bioinformatics pipeline has the potential to accurately capture large indels (>20 bp) in patient samples, we highlighted the pitfall of a confounding ZRSR1 pseudogene that led to an erroneous ZRSR2 variant call. We further discuss possible clinical implications of the ZRSR1 pseudogene in myeloid neoplasms based on its molecular features. Knowledge of the confounding ZRSR1 pseudogene in ZRSR2 sequencing assays could be particularly important in AML diagnostics because the detection of ZRSR2 in AML patients is highly specific for an s-AML diagnosis.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

Epub 2017 Jul 1.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cyperus rotundus L. (CR) has been traditionally used as an herbal medicine in Asian countries to treat diverse gynecological disorders. However, the potential therapeutic effect of CR on endometrial receptivity for successful embryo implantation to treat female infertility has not been fully studied. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of water-extracted CR on endometrial receptivity by investigating the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrins, cell adhesion, and embryo implantation using mifepristone (RU486; RU)-induced implantation failure model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The water extract of CR was prepared and fingerprinted using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For the expression and regulation of LIF, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were performed in CR-stimulated Ishikawa cells. To evaluate LIF-mediated integrin expression, knockdown of LIF by shRNA was performed in Ishikawa cells. The effect of CR on endometrial receptivity was determined by an in vitro adhesion assay between JAr cells and CR-induced Ishikawa cells. In vivo, C57BL/6 female mice (n = 7 per group) orally received CR (31.68mg/kg/day), a similar dose as used clinically. Seven days after CR treatment, all female mice were caged with male mice until pregnancy was verified. On day 4 of pregnancy, RU (4mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to induce embryo implantation failure. RESULT: CR increased the expression of LIF through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI-3K/AKT) signaling pathway in Ishikawa cells. In addition, CR enhanced adhesion of JAr cells onto Ishikawa cells by inducing the expression of LIF-dependent integrins alphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5. Furthermore, CR improved the number of implantation sites in pregnant mice despite RU injection. CONCLUSION: CR increased the expression of LIF-mediated integrins alphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 on the surface of endometrial cells, which is associated with adhesion of trophoblastic cells to endometrial cells for blastocyst implantation. Our findings provide evidence that CR has therapeutic potential against poor endometrial receptivity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Epub 2017 Jul 1.,"The successful immunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been hampered because most potential antigenic targets are shared with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), increasing the risk of sustained and severe hematopoietic toxicity following treatment. C-type lectin-like molecule 1 (CLL-1) is a membrane glycoprotein expressed by >80% of AML but is absent on normal HSCs. Here we describe the development and evaluation of CLL-1-specific chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CLL-1.CAR-Ts) and we demonstrate their specific activity against CLL-1(+) AML cell lines as well as primary AML patient samples in vitro. CLL-1.CAR-Ts selectively reduced leukemic colony formation in primary AML patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to control T cells. In a human xenograft mouse model, CLL-1.CAR-Ts mediated anti-leukemic activity against disseminated AML and significantly extended survival. By contrast, the colony formation of normal progenitor cells remained intact following CLL-1.CAR-T treatment. Although CLL-1.CAR-Ts are cytotoxic to mature normal myeloid cells, the selective sparing of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells should allow full myeloid recovery once CLL-1.CAR-T activity terminates. To enable elective ablation of the CAR-T, we therefore introduced the inducible caspase-9 suicide gene system and we show that exposure to the activating drug rapidly induced a controlled decrease of unwanted CLL-1.CAR-T activity against mature normal myeloid cells.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Recent studies suggested that G-CSF-primed BM (G-BM) had similar engraftment but lower morbidity and mortality of GVHD comparing to G-PBSC. A prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted to compare G-BM with G-PBSC as the grafts in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute leukemia in first complete remission (CR1). METHODS: Totally 101 adult leukemia in CR1 undergoing HLA-identical sibling transplants were randomized into G-BM or G-PBSC group. The primary study endpoint was GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS). RESULTS: Both the engraftment of neutrophil and platelet were 2 days later in G-BM than in G-PBSC group (P = 0.412, P = 0.39). G-BM group showed significantly lower II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and similar III-IV aGVHD compared with G-PBSC group (12.2% vs 28.8% for II-IV, P = 0.048; 4.1% vs 9.6% for III-IV aGVHD, P = 0.267, respectively). The overall cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) at 3 years were 22.3% +/- 6.3% and 44.8% +/- 7.6% (P = 0.026), respectively, and extensive cGHVD were 4.5% +/- 3.1% and 15% +/- 5.3% (P = 0.08), respectively, in G-BM and G-PBSC groups. Two groups had similar 3-year relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) (all P > 0.05). G-BM group showed significantly higher probability of GRFS than G-PBSC group (73.5% +/- 6.3% vs 55.8% +/- 6.9% at 1 year, P = 0.049; 69.0% +/- 6.7% vs 49.7% +/- 7.0% at 2 and 3 years, P = 0.03, respectively). Graft content analysis revealed statistically higher frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the G-BM than in G-PBSC grafts (P < 0.01), and recipients received statistically higher numbers of MDSCs in G-BM than in G-PBSC group (P = 0.045). Numbers of MDSCs infused to patients were negatively correlated with the severity of aGVHD (P = 0.032, r = -0.214). Multivariate analysis showed that MDSC cell dose below the median (HR = 3.49, P < 0.001), recipient age (HR = 2.02, P = 0.039), and high risk of disease (HR = 2.14, P = 0.018) were independent risk factors for GRFS.

antigen-matched sibling donor transplantation (MSDT) or who received unmanipulated haploidentical allografts. METHODS: A retrospective study (n = 339) and a prospective study (n = 340) were performed. MRD was determined using multiparameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: Either after retrospective or prospective analysis, patients with negative pre-MRD (pre-MRDneg) had a lower incidence of relapse than those with positive pre-MRD (pre-MRDpos) in MSDT settings (P < 0.001 for all), but relapse was comparable in Haplo-SCT settings for patients with pre-MRDneg versus pre-MRDpos (P = 0.866 and 0.161, respectively). In either the retrospective (n = 65) or the prospective study (n = 76), pre-MRDpos subjects receiving Haplo-SCT experienced a lower incidence of relapse than those who underwent MSDT (P < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). Of the patients with pre-MRDpos in either the total (n = 141) or the subgroup excluding cases which received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI; n = 105), those who underwent MSDT had a higher incidence of relapse than those receiving haplo-SCT (P < 0.01 for all). Multivariate analysis showed that, for pre-MRDpos cases, haplo-SCT was associated with a low incidence of relapse and with better LFS and OS in either retrospective group, prospective group, combination groups, or subgroup not including cases which received DLI. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that, for pre-MRD-positive AML patients, haplo-SCT was associated with lower incidence of relapse and better survival, suggesting a stronger anti-leukemia effect.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Multiparameter flow cytometry', '*Unmanipulated haploidentical allografts']",,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],PMC5496245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all these cell types KCa3.1 plays an important role in cellular activation, migration and proliferation by regulating membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling. METHODS AND RESULTS: KCa3.1 therefore constitutes an attractive therapeutic target for diseases involving excessive proliferation or activation of one more of these cell types and researchers both in academia and in the pharmaceutical industry have developed several potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of KCa3.1. This article will briefly review the available compounds (TRAM-34, senicapoc, NS6180), their binding sites and mechanisms of action, and then discuss the potential usefulness of these compounds for the treatment of brain tumors based on their brain penetration and their efficacy in reducing microglia activation in animal models of ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease.

Epub 2017 Jul 4.,"Objectives Flow cytometry (FC) is becoming increasingly popular among veterinary oncologists for the diagnosis of lymphoma or leukaemia. It is accurate, fast and minimally invasive. Several studies of FC have been carried out in canine oncology and applied with great results, whereas there is limited knowledge and use of this technique in feline patients. This is mainly owing to the high prevalence of intra-abdominal lymphomas in this species and the difficulty associated with the diagnostic procedures needed to collect the sample. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether any pre-analytical factor might affect the quality of suspected feline lymphoma samples for FC analysis. Methods Ninety-seven consecutive samples of suspected feline lymphoma were retrospectively selected from the authors' institution's FC database. The referring veterinarians were contacted and interviewed about several different variables, including signalment, appearance of the lesion, features of the sampling procedure and the experience of veterinarians performing the sampling. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the possible influence of these variables on the cellularity of the samples and the likelihood of it being finally processed for FC. Results Sample cellularity is a major factor in the likelihood of the sample being processed. Moreover, sample cellularity was significantly influenced by the needle size, with 21 G needles providing the highest cellularity. Notably, the sample cellularity and the likelihood of being processed did not vary between peripheral and intra-abdominal lesions. Approximately half of the cats required pharmacological restraint. Side effects were reported in one case only (transient swelling after peripheral lymph node sampling). Conclusions and relevance FC can be safely applied to cases of suspected feline lymphomas, including intra-abdominal lesions. A 21 G needle should be preferred for sampling. This study provides the basis for the increased use of this minimally invasive, fast and cost-effective technique in feline medicine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 1.,"INTRODUCTION: Hypomethylating agents (HMA) have played a pivotal role for treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) over the past decade, inducing sustained hematological responses and delaying progression to leukemia. However, a vast majority of patients will experience treatment failure within 2 years, with poor prognoses and limited options, and management of this growing patient population remains unclear. Areas covered: With the introduction of new agents in the MDS field, a better understanding of the biology of MDS, and updated information on standard of care options (including allogeneic transplantation), we re-evaluate the global treatment strategy in MDS via novel agents, focusing in particular on investigational approaches for patients who fail to respond to HMA when applicable. This review aims to address two questions: what are reasonable alternatives to HMA in MDS, and what strategies can be used for patients experiencing HMA failure. Expert opinion/commentary: HMA therapy remains a mainstay of treatment, even if additional research is still warranted to maximize its benefits for the different groups of patients. The outcome of patients experiencing HMA failure remains grim, without standard of care, but several new approaches seem promising, as there is an increasing focus on studying treatments for patients refractory to HMA treatment.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Disease management', 'IPSS', 'epigenetic modification', 'hypomethylating agent failure', 'hypomethylating agents', 'investigational agents', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'treatment failure']",['K24 CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",PMC6121132,['NIHMS1500382'],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6872-625X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DotScan's diagnostic capability was validated with an extensive clinical trial using mononuclear cells from the blood or bone marrow of leukemia or lymphoma patients. DotScan has also been used for the profiling of surface proteins on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with HIV, liver disease, and stable and progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Fluorescence multiplexing allowed the simultaneous profiling of cancer cells and leukocytes from disaggregated colorectal and melanoma tumor biopsies after capture on DotScan. In this chapter, we have used DotScan for the surface profiling of extracellular vesicles (EV) recovered from conditioned growth medium of cancer cell lines and the blood of patients with CLL. The detection of captured EV was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using biotinylated antibodies that recognized antigens expressed on the surface of the EV subset of interest. DotScan was also used to profile EV from the blood of healthy individuals and the ascites fluid of ovarian cancer patients. DotScan binding patterns of EV from human plasma and other body fluids may yield diagnostic or prognostic signatures for monitoring the incidence, treatment, and progression of cancers.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD antigen', '*Chemiluminescence', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Exosomes', '*Ovarian cancer', '*Shed microvesicles']",,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyze transcriptomic data from multiple cohorts of clinically annotated AML patients and report that (i) microarrays designed for coding gene expression can be repurposed to yield robust lincRNA expression data, (ii) some lincRNA genes are located in close proximity to hematopoietic coding genes and show strong expression correlations in AML, (iii) lincRNA gene expression patterns distinguish cytogenetic and molecular subtypes of AML, (iv) lincRNA signatures composed of three or four genes are independent predictors of clinical outcome and further dichotomize survival in European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk groups and (v) an analytical tool based on logistic regression analysis of quantitative PCR measurement of four lincRNA genes (LINC4) can be used to determine risk in AML.",,,,['MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9615-9432', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3144-4507', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5105-2554']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adults >/=70 years with a hematologic malignancy undergoing first allogeneic HCT in the United States between 2000 and 2013 and reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research were eligible. Transplant utilization and transplant outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and transplant-related mortality (TRM) were studied. One thousand one hundred and six patients >/=70 years underwent HCT across 103 transplant centers. The number and proportion of allografts performed in this population rose markedly over the past decade, accounting for 0.1% of transplants in 2000 to 3.85% (N = 298) in 2013. Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes represented the most common disease indications. Two-year OS and PFS significantly improved over time (OS: 26% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21% to 33%] in 2000-2007 to 39% [95% CI, 35% to 42%] in 2008-2013, P < .001; PFS: 22% [16% to 28%] in 2000-2007 to 32% [95% CI, 29% to 36%] in 2008-2013, P = .003). Two-year TRM ranged from 33% to 35% and was unchanged over time (P = .54). Multivariable analysis of OS in the modern era of 2008-2013 revealed higher comorbidity by HCT comorbidity index >/=3 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; P = .006), umbilical cord blood graft (HR, 1.97; P = .0002), and myeloablative conditioning (HR, 1.61; P = .0002) as adverse factors.

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"Despite significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of myelofibrosis (MF), and possible prolongation of patients' survival, some have disease that is refractory to ruxolitinib and many lose their response over time. Furthermore, patients with >/=3 mutations are less likely to respond to ruxolitinib. Here we describe outcomes after ruxolitinib discontinuation in MF patients enrolled in a phase 1/2 study at our center. After a median follow-up of 79 months, 86 patients had discontinued ruxolitinib (30 of whom died while on therapy). The median follow-up after ruxolitinib discontinuation for the remaining 56 patients was 32 months, with median survival after discontinuation of 14 months. Platelets <260 x 10(9)/L at the start of therapy or <100 x 10(9)/L at the time of discontinuation were associated with shorter survival after discontinuation. Of 62 patients with molecular data at baseline and follow-up, 22 (35%) acquired a new mutation while receiving ruxolitinib (14 [61%] in ASXL1). Patients showing clonal evolution had significantly shorter survival after discontinuation (6 vs 16 months). Transfusion dependency was the only clinical variable associated with clonal evolution. These findings underscore the need for novel therapies and suggest that clonal evolution or decreasing platelet counts while on ruxolitinib therapy may be markers of poor prognosis.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",PMC5580275,,,,,['Blood. 2017 Aug 31;130(9):1075-1077.

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"Assisted reproductive technologies in all mammals are critically dependent on the quality of the oocytes used to produce embryos. For reasons not fully clear, oocytes matured in vitro tend to be much less competent to become fertilized, advance to the blastocyst stage, and give rise to live young than their in vivo-produced counterparts, particularly if they are derived from immature females. Here we show that a chemically defined maturation medium supplemented with three cytokines (FGF2, LIF, and IGF1) in combination, so-called ""FLI medium,"" improves nuclear maturation of oocytes in cumulus-oocyte complexes derived from immature pig ovaries and provides a twofold increase in the efficiency of blastocyst production after in vitro fertilization. Transfer of such blastocysts to recipient females doubles mean litter size to about nine piglets per litter. Maturation of oocytes in FLI medium, therefore, effectively provides a fourfold increase in piglets born per oocyte collected. As they progress in culture, the FLI-matured cumulus-oocyte complexes display distinctly different kinetics of MAPK activation in the cumulus cells, much increased cumulus cell expansion, and an accelerated severance of cytoplasmic projections between the cumulus cells outside the zona pellucida and the oocyte within. These events likely underpin the improvement in oocyte quality achieved by using the FLI medium.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MAPK signaling', '*cumulus cell', '*embryo development', '*genetic modification', '*in vitro fertilization']","['R01 HD069979/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U42 OD011140/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",PMC5530680,,,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: Y.Y., L.D.S., R.S.P., and R.M.R. have a pending', 'patent application ""Medium Supplement to Increase the Efficiency of Oocyte', 'maturation and Embryo Culture in vitro.""']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 30.,"Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is 1 of the standard treatments for myeloid malignancy, relapse remains a major obstacle to cure. Early detection of relapse by monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) may enable us to intervene pre-emptively and potentially prevent overt relapse. Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) is well known as a pan-leukemic marker. We retrospectively examined serially monitored WT1 levels of peripheral blood in 98 patients (84 with acute myeloid leukemia and 14 with myelodysplastic syndrome). At the time of allo-HSCT, 49 patients (50%) were in complete remission. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to WT1 levels (<50 copies/microg RNA, 50 to 500 copies/microg RNA and >500 copies/microg RNA). The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and overall survival (OS) differed statistically according to the WT1 levels before allo-HSCT and at days 30 and 60 after allo-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, WT1 >500 copies/microg RNA before and at day 60 after allo-HSCT and WT1 >/=50 copies/microg RNA at day 30 were correlated with CIR. Moreover, WT1 >500 copies/microg RNA at day 60 after allo-HSCT was only correlated with worse OS. Our data suggest that serial monitoring of WT1 levels in peripheral blood may be useful for MRD monitoring and as a predictor of hematological relapse in allo-HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, using high throughput transcriptome sequencing of HD11 and CEF cells infected with ALV-J, a set of 4804 novel long non-coding transcripts and numerous differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified. We also found that they share relatively shorter transcripts and fewer exon numbers compared to mRNA. Correlation analysis suggested that many lncRNAs may activate gene expression in an enhancer-like manner other than through transcriptional regulation. Expression level analyses in vivo showed that three lncRNAs (NONGGAT001975.2, NONGGAT005832.2 and NONGGAT009792.2) may be associated with immune response regulation and could function as novel biomarkers for ALV-J infection. Our findings provides new insight into the pathological process of ALV-J infection and should serve as a high-quality resource for further research on epigenetic influences on disease-resistance breeding as well as immune system and genomic studies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

They ushered in the age of targeted chemotherapy in 1910 with the discovery of the anti-syphilitic organic arsenic agent, arsphenamine or Salvarsan (also known as 606). It was the clinical compound of choice for treating syphilis until penicillin and other antibiotics were introduced clinically in the 1940s. Yet now, more than 100years after its discovery, the precise biochemical mechanism by which this compound eliminates the syphilis spirochete in vivo from humans and animals remains unknown. Other organic arsenic compounds such as melarsoprol and roxarson have been used to treat parasitic infections. More recently, arsenic trioxide has been shown effective in producing remissions and possibly cures in a high percentage of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the exact biochemical mechanism by which this clinical result is manifested remains to be determined. The purpose of this publication is to propose a possible mechanism, by which these apparently diverse arsenic compounds function to produce their clinical results and to suggest their potential for the treatment of infections caused by resistant organisms.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The current standard of care chemotherapy, leads to complete remission (CR) in the vast majority of adult patients under the age of 60. In contrast, CR rates in patients over the age of 60 reaches only 40-60%. While achievement of a CR is an important stepping stone in the treatment of AML, the majority of these patients experience relapse and die of their disease without adequate consolidation chemotherapy. Blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) can improve outcome in a select patient with AML but unfortunately, it is not a valid treatment option for the majority of older patients. Thus, the development of novel chemotherapy regimens that capitalizes on AML biology to eliminate the malignant clone with little to no side effects on the normal haematopoiesis is paramount in the treatment of elderly patients. In the current paper, we propose to take advantage of the dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms present in AML cells and induce synthetic lethality using a combination of PARP inhibitors with low dose anthracycline and DNMT inhibitors. Such a combination, while effectively eliminating leukaemia should be well tolerated and thus, suitable for the treatment of frail patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This mechanism evolved to more rapidly produce RPs on demand in different tissues. Here we show that 40S ribosomes, in a complex with the mRNA binding protein LARP1, selectively stabilize 5'TOP mRNAs, with disruption of this complex leading to induction of the impaired ribosome biogenesis checkpoint (IRBC) and p53 stabilization. The importance of this mechanism is underscored in 5q- syndrome, a macrocytic anemia caused by a large monoallelic deletion, which we found to also encompass the LARP1 gene. Critically, depletion of LARP1 alone in human adult CD34+ bone marrow precursor cells leads to a reduction in 5'TOP mRNAs and the induction of p53. These studies identify a 40S ribosome function independent of those in translation that, with LARP1, mediates the autogenous control of 5'TOP mRNA stability, whose disruption is implicated in the pathophysiology of 5q- syndrome.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A small number of regulatory factors influence transcription elongation on a global scale. Prior research using small-molecule BET bromodomain inhibitors, such as JQ1, linked BRD4 to context-specific elongation at a limited number of genes associated with massive enhancer regions. Here, the mechanistic characterization of an optimized chemical degrader of BET bromodomain proteins, dBET6, led to the unexpected identification of BET proteins as master regulators of global transcription elongation. In contrast to the selective effect of bromodomain inhibition on transcription, BET degradation prompts a collapse of global elongation that phenocopies CDK9 inhibition. Notably, BRD4 loss does not directly affect CDK9 localization. These studies, performed in translational models of T cell leukemia, establish a mechanism-based rationale for the development of BET bromodomain degradation as cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, the two proteins act as regulators of P53, a well-known key controller of the cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation that, when altered, plays a direct role on cancer development and progression. Several evidence demonstrated that functional aberrations of P53 in tumors are in most cases the consequence of alterations on the MDM2 and MDMX regulatory proteins, in particular in patients with hematological malignancies where TP53 shows a relatively low frequency of mutation while MDM2 and MDMX are frequently found amplified/overexpressed. The pharmacological targeting of these two P53-regulators in order to restore or increase P53 expression and activity represents therefore a strategy for cancer therapy. From the discovery of the Nutlins in 2004, several compounds have been developed and reported with the ability of targeting the P53-MDM2/X axis by inhibiting MDM2 and/or MDMX. From natural compounds up to small molecules and stapled peptides, these MDM2/X pharmacological inhibitors have been extensively studied, revealing different biological features and different rate of efficacy when tested in in vitro and in vivo experimental tumor models. The data/evidence coming from the preclinical experimentation have allowed the identification of the most promising molecules and the setting of clinical studies for their evaluation as monotherapy or in therapeutic combination with conventional chemotherapy or with innovative therapeutic protocols in different tumor settings. Preliminary results have been recently published reporting data about safety, tolerability, potential side effects, and efficacy of such therapeutic approaches.

The results showed that ZFAS1 expression was increased in all four human AML cell lines compared with the control cell lines (T lymphocytic leukemia or Burkitt's lymphoma). Transfection with small interfering RNA into human AML cells established ZFAS1 knockdown. A cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to investigate the effect of ZFAS1 on AML cell proliferation and the effect of ZFAS1 on the cell cycle and cell apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry. Notably, the CCK-8 assay demonstrated that ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation in HL-60 and SKNO-1 cell lines and flow cytometry analysis indicated that ZFAS1 knockdown induced AML cell cycle G1 phase arrest and triggered cell apoptosis.

Epub 2017 Jun 1.,"The pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV(+)) mature T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms is challenging to understand. The clinical features are diverse, with no typical manifestation. Therefore, it is important to analyze the association of the clinical characteristics and prognoses of patients with various factors associated with EBV(+) T/NK-cell neoplasms, particularly extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, systemic EBV(+) T/NK cell lymphoproliferative disorders, aggressive NK cell leukemia and EBV(+) peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, 42 cases of EBV(+) T/NK-cell neoplasms with information on age, gender, fever, LDH level, complete blood count (CBC) and immunophenotype (CD5/CD20) were retrospectively analyzed to examine the clinical features, prognoses and related factors. It was found that patients </=60 years old accounted for 86% of cases. The frequency of stage III/IV disease was higher in groups with pancytopenia (P=0.005), high LDH level (P=0.020), CD5-expression status (P=0.031) and fever (P=0.024). There were significant differences in the mean International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores according to the presence or absence of fever (P=0.022), elevated or normal lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P=0.001), and pancytopenia or normal complete blood count (CBC; P=0.046). Analysis of overall survival showed that CD5 expression, CBC, IPI scores and LDH levels were factors associated with OS. CD5 expression (P=0.003), CBC (P=0.003) and IPI scores (P=0.017) were identified to be important risk factors on the basis of Cox regression analysis. The mean survival time was longer in the CD5(+), CD20(+) and normal CBC groups, and there was no clear difference in survival time according to LDH level or fever. In summary, CD5 and CD20 may be prognostic factors in EBV(+) T/NK lymphoid neoplasms, and CBC and fever are most likely to influence the IPI score and Ann Arbor stage.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'T/natural killer cells', 'lymphoproliferative disorders', 'neoplasms']",,,PMC5488386,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 May 17.,"Rice is a staple food in numerous countries around the world. Anthocyanins found in black rice have been reported to reduce the risk of certain diseases, but the effects of crude extract of anthocyanins from Asia University-selected purple glutinous indica rice (AUPGA) on immune responses have not yet been demonstrated. The current study aimed to investigate whether AUPGA treatment could affect immune responses in murine leukemia cells in vivo. Murine acute myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 cells were intraperitoneally injected into normal BALB/c mice to generate leukemia mice. A total of 50 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=10 in each group) and were fed a diet supplemented with AUPGA at 0, 20, 50 or 100 mg/kg for three weeks. All mice were weighed and the blood, liver and spleen were collected for further experiments. The results indicated that AUPGA did not significantly affect animal body weight, but significantly increased spleen weight (P<0.05) and decreased liver weight (P<0.05) when compared with the control group. AUPGA significantly increased the T cell (CD3) population at treatments of 20 and 100 mg/kg (P<0.05). However, it only significantly increased the B cell (CD19) population at a treatment of 20 mg/kg (P<0.05). Furthermore, AUPGA at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly increased the monocyte (CD11b) population and the level of macrophages (Mac-3; P<0.05 for both). AUPGA at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly promoted macrophage phagocytosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P<0.05), and all doses of AUPGA treatment significantly promoted macrophage phagocytotic activity in the peritoneum (P<0.05). AUPGA treatment significantly decreased natural killer cell activity from splenocytes (P<0.05). Finally, AUPGA treatment at 20 mg/kg treatment significantly promoted T cell proliferation (P<0.05), and treatment at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly decreased B cell proliferation compared with the control group (P<0.05).",,['NOTNLM'],"['WEHI-3 cells', 'crude extract of anthocyanins from black rice', 'macrophage', 'natural killer cell', 'phagocytosis']",,,PMC5488472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"Purpose Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive deficits that are associated with treatment, individual, and environmental factors. This study examined the impact of different methotrexate (MTX) and corticosteroid treatment strategies on neurocognitive functioning in children with high-risk B-lineage ALL. Methods Participants were randomly assigned to receive high-dose MTX with leucovorin rescue or escalating dose MTX with PEG asparaginase without leucovorin rescue. Patients were also randomly assigned to corticosteroid therapy that included either dexamethasone or prednisone. A neurocognitive evaluation of intellectual functioning (IQ), working memory, and processing speed (PS) was conducted 8 to 24 months after treatment completion (n = 192). Results The method of MTX delivery and corticosteroid assignment were unrelated to differences in neurocognitive outcomes after controlling for ethnicity, race, age, gender, insurance status, and time off treatment; however, survivors who were age < 10 years at diagnosis (n = 89) had significantly lower estimated IQ ( P < .001) and PS scores ( P = .02) compared with participants age >/= 10 years. In addition, participants who were covered by US public health insurance had estimated IQs that were significantly lower ( P < .001) than those with US private or military insurance. Conclusion Children with high-risk B-lineage ALL who were age < 10 years at diagnosis are at risk for deficits in IQ and PS in the absence of cranial radiation, regardless of MTX delivery or corticosteroid type. These data may serve as a basis for developing screening protocols to identify children who are at high risk for deficits so that early intervention can be initiated to mitigate the impact of therapy on neurocognitive outcomes.",,,,"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",PMC5549456,,,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2017 Dec 10;35(35):3989.

Using integrated genomic analysis of 264 T-ALL cases, we identified 106 putative driver genes, half of which had not previously been described in childhood T-ALL (for example, CCND3, CTCF, MYB, SMARCA4, ZFP36L2 and MYCN). We describe new mechanisms of coding and noncoding alteration and identify ten recurrently altered pathways, with associations between mutated genes and pathways, and stage or subtype of T-ALL. For example, NRAS/FLT3 mutations were associated with immature T-ALL, JAK3/STAT5B mutations in HOXA1 deregulated ALL, PTPN2 mutations in TLX1 deregulated T-ALL, and PIK3R1/PTEN mutations in TAL1 deregulated ALL, which suggests that different signaling pathways have distinct roles according to maturational stage.

Cases positive for fusions involving SPI1 (encoding PU.1), accounting for 3.9% (7/181) of the examined pediatric T-ALL cases, showed a double-negative (DN; CD4(-)CD8(-)) or CD8(+) single-positive (SP) phenotype and had uniformly poor overall survival. These cases represent a subset of pediatric T-ALL distinguishable from the known T-ALL subsets in terms of expression of genes involved in T cell precommitment, establishment of T cell identity, and post-beta-selection maturation and with respect to mutational profile. PU.1 fusion proteins retained transcriptional activity and, when constitutively expressed in mouse stem/progenitor cells, induced cell proliferation and resulted in a maturation block.

Here, we show that the overexpression of P-gp in L1210 cells leads to resistance to tunicamycin and benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-galactopyranoside (GalNAc-alpha-O-benzyl). Tunicamycin induces both glycosylation depression and ubiquitination improvement of P-gp. However, the latter is not associated with large increases in molecular mass as evidence for polyubiquitination. Therefore, P-gp continues in maturation to an active membrane efflux pump rather than proteasomal degradation. P-gp-positive L1210 cells contain a higher quantity of ubiquitin associated with cell surface proteins than their P-gp-negative counterparts. Thus, P-gp-positive cells use ubiquitin signaling for correct protein folding to a higher extent than P-gp-negative cells.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 62,301 cats tested at 1,396 veterinary clinics (n = 45,406) and 127 animal shelters (16,895). PROCEDURES Blood samples were tested with a point-of-care ELISA for FeLV antigen and anti-FIV antibody. Seroprevalence was estimated, and risk factors for seropositivity were evaluated with bivariate and multivariable mixed-model logistic regression analyses adjusted for within-clinic or within-shelter dependencies. RESULTS Overall, seroprevalence was 3.1% for FeLV antigen and 3.6% for anti-FIV antibody. Adult age, outdoor access, clinical disease, and being a sexually intact male were risk factors for seropositivity for each virus. Odds of seropositivity for each virus were greater for cats tested in clinics than for those tested in shelters. Of 1,611 cats with oral disease, 76 (4.7%) and 157 (9.7%) were seropositive for FeLV and FIV, respectively. Of 4,835 cats with respiratory disease, 385 (8.0%) were seropositive for FeLV and 308 (6.4%) were seropositive for FIV. Of 1,983 cats with abscesses or bite wounds, 110 (5.5%) and 247 (12.5%) were seropositive for FeLV and FIV, respectively. Overall, 2,368 of 17,041 (13.9%) unhealthy cats were seropositive for either or both viruses, compared with 1,621 of 45,260 (3.6%) healthy cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Seroprevalences for FeLV antigen and anti-FIV antibody were similar to those reported in previous studies over the past decade. Taken together, these results indicated a need to improve compliance with existing guidelines for management of feline retroviruses.",,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"BACKGROUND: Little is published on patient blood management (PBM) programs in hematology. In 2008 Western Australia announced a health system-wide PBM program with PBM staff appointments commencing in November 2009. Our aim was to assess the impact this program had on blood utilization and patient outcomes in intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 695 admissions at two tertiary hospitals receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between July 2010 and December 2014 was conducted. Main outcomes included pre-red blood cell (RBC) transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) levels, single-unit RBC transfusions, number of RBC and platelet (PLT) units transfused per admission, subsequent day case transfusions, length of stay, serious bleeding, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Over the study period, the mean RBC units transfused per admission decreased 39% from 6.1 to 3.7 (p < 0.001), and the mean PLT units transfused decreased 35% from 6.3 to 4.1 (p < 0.001), with mean RBC and PLT units transfused for follow-up day cases decreasing from 0.6 to 0.4 units (p < 0.001). Mean pre-RBC transfusion Hb level decreased from 8.0 to 6.8 g/dL (p < 0.001), and single-unit RBC transfusions increased 39% to 67% (p < 0.001). This reduction represents blood product cost savings of AU$694,886 (US$654,007). There were no significant changes in unadjusted or adjusted length of stay, serious bleeding events, or in-hospital mortality over the study. CONCLUSION: The health system-wide PBM program had a significant impact, reducing blood product use and costs without increased morbidity or mortality in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['(c) 2017 AABB.'],,,,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recurrent or refractory leukemia remains the major problem of the AML and no clearly effective therapy has been established so far. Traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are both far dissatisfying the patients partly for their individual variety. Besides, conventional treatments usually have many side effects to result in poor prognosis. Therefore, an urgent need is necessary to update therapies of AML. To date, protein kinase inhibitors as new drugs offer hope for AML treatment and many of them are on clinical trials. Here, this review will provide a brief summary of protein kinase inhibitors investigated in AML thus far, mainly including tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors.

Other highly specific BH3-mimetics are in pre-clinical development. Understanding the functional interactions among the Bcl-2 family is of prime importance to fully exploit their potential. NOXA is considered a rather weak BH3-only member but it has unexplored potential in various settings, which are of relevance in cancer. NOXA is best known as a selective inhibitor of MCL1, itself overexpressed in many cancers, and this protein pair forms an important rheostat in many forms of cell stress. Areas covered: We summarize the distinct pathways that induce NOXA RNA and protein, and how this may be exploited in solid and hematopoietic cancers, with a focus on multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Expert opinion: The therapeutic potential to induce NOXA is not yet fully explored nor exploited, and we suggest 1) areas that require further fundamental investigation, including replicative stress and epigenetics, 2) areas where translation to therapeutic application seems more imminent (ER stress, ROS, inhibition of NOXA degradation) 3) a complementary approach to inducing NOXA by direct targeting of MCL1 via the novel BH3 mimetic S63845 and similar compounds.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Bcl-2 family', '*Mcl-1', '*Noxa']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer patients frequently seek remedies from traditional medicinal plants that are believed to exert less side effects than conventional therapy with synthetic drugs. A long-lasting goal of anti-cancer and anti-microbial therapy research is to find compounds with reduced side effects compared to currently approved drugs. In this respect, Cedrus species might be of interest. The essential oil isolated from Cedrus libani leaves may bear potential for drug development due to its high concentrations of germacrene D and beta-caryophyllene.

Among multitude oncogenic proteins involved in acquisition of a chemo-resistanr phenotype, osteopontin (OPN) recently has attracted marked attention. In spite of the well-defined association between OPN expression and cure rate with solid tumors, there is a scarcity of information on any role of this protein in AML cases. Based on the critical role of OPN in cell survival, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that isoform expression levels may impact on regulation of apoptosis in AML cells in response to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and its relation to relapse. To investigate associations between induction of apoptosis and OPN isoform expression, two distinct AML cell lines (KG-1 as a leukemic stem cell model and U937) were treated with chemotherapy drugs, and cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and Annexin/PI assay. After determination of appropriate drug doses, mRNA expression levels of OPN isoforms and OPN-related genes were investigated. Our results demonstrated for the first time that acquired up-regulation of OPN-b and c isoforms might prevent conventional chemotherapy regimen-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Moreover, upregulation of OPN-b and c in AML cells appears concurrent with upregulation of AKT/VEGF/CXCR4/STAT3/ IL-6 gene expression. To sum up, this study suggests that OPN-b and c isoforms could be considered as unique beneficial molecular biomarkers associated with leukemic stem cell chemoresistance. Hence, they have potential as molecular candidates for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) and determination of remission in AML patients. Further evaluation with quantative real time PCR on patient samples for confirmation appears warranted.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Osteopontin', '*leukemis stem cells', '*chemoresistance', '*acute myeloid leukemia']",,,PMC6373801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to some evidence, progression of hematolymphoid malignancies depends on the induction of new blood vessel formation under the influence of acute leukemia. Various factors are produced by cancer cells under hypoxic conditions to increase vascular formation. Among these, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role. Cytotoxicity and anticancer effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) have been reported in many cancers. Sorafenib, known as an angiogenic inhibitor, decreases leukemic cell survival. The aim of this study was to indicate combination effects of ATO and sorafenib in two AML cell lines, KG-1 and U937. Effective doses was determined by MTT assay for both single and combination treatments. Percentages of apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin V FITC staining and mRNA levels of VEGF isoforms and receptor expression were investigated by Real-Time PCR. Our data show that sorafenib (5muM and 7muM in KG-1 and U937 cell lines respectively), ATO (1.618muM and 1muM in KG-1 and U937 cell lines respectively), and also their combination significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. In addition the mRNA level of VEGF isoforms was downregulated in the U937 cell line while upregulated in KG-1 cells.

Epub 2017 Aug 20.,"CPNE3, a member of a Ca(2+) -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family, was identified as a ligand of ERBB2 and has a more general role in carcinogenesis. Here, we identified the prognostic significance of CPNE3 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients based on two datasets. In the first microarray dataset (n = 272), compared to low CPNE3 expression (CPNE3(low) ), high CPNE3 expression (CPNE3(high) ) was associated with adverse overall survival (OS, P < 0.001) and event-free survival (EFS, P < 0.001). In the second independent group of AML patients (TCGA dataset, n = 179), CPNE3(high) was also associated with adverse OS and EFS (OS, P = 0.01; EFS, P = 0.036). Notably, among CPNE3(high) patients, those received allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) had longer OS and EFS than those with chemotherapy alone (allogeneic HCT, n = 40 vs chemotherapy, n = 46), but treatment modules played an insignificant role in the survival of CPNE3(low) patients (allogeneic HCT, n = 32 vs chemotherapy, n = 54). These results indicated that CPNE3(high) is an independent, adverse prognostic factor in AML and might guide treatment decisions towards allogeneic HCT. To understand its inherent mechanisms, we investigated genome-wide gene/microRNA expression signatures and cell signaling pathways associated with CPNE3 expression. In conclusion, CPNE3(high) is an adverse prognostic biomarker for AML. Its effect may be attributed to the distinctive genome-wide gene/microRNA expression and related cell signaling pathways.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

In this research, we have prepared a monomer of p-nitrophenyl-oxycarbonyl poly (ethylene glycol) methacrylate (MEONP) to synthesize this polymer. Next, we designed and prepared a smart, water soluble, amphiphilic PMBN polymer composed of MPC, BMA, and MEONP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, we dissolved MPC (4 mmol, 40% mole fraction), BMA (5 mmol, 50% mole fraction), and MEONP (1 mmol, 10% mole fraction) in 20 ml of dry ethanol in two necked flasks equipped with inlet-outlet gas. The structural characteristics of the synthesized monomer and polymer were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses for the first time. We treated the polymer with two different cell lines to determine its biocompatibility. RESULTS: FT-IR and H-NMR analyses confirmed the synthesis of the polymer. The size of polymer was approximately 40 nm with a molecular weight (MW) of 52 kDa, which would be excellent for a nano carrier. Microscopic analyses showed that the polymer was rodshaped. This polymer had no toxicity for individual cells. CONCLUSION: We report here, for the first time, the full properties of the PMBN polymer. The approximately 40 nm size with an acceptable zeta potential range of -8.47, PDI of 0.1, and rod-shaped structure indicated adequate parameters of a nanopolymer for nano bioapplications. We used this polymer to design a new smart nano carrier to treat leukemia stem cells based on a target DDS as a type of bio-application.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug Delivery System', 'Nano', 'Polymer']",,,PMC5412785,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), a member of the T-cell Factor (TCF)/LEF1 family of high-mobility group transcription factors, is a downstream mediator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, but can also modulate gene transcription independently. LEF1 is essential in stem cell maintenance and organ development, especially in its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by activating the transcription of hallmark EMT effectors including N-Cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail. Aberrant expression of LEF1 is implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. LEF1's activity in particular cancer cell types, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and colorectal cancer (CRC), makes it a valuable biomarker in predicting patient prognosis. Additionally, due to aberrant LEF1 activity resulting in cancer progression, knockdown and inhibition treatments designed to target LEF1 have proven effective in alleviating cancer growth, migration, and invasion in CLL, CRC, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In prostate cancer cells, LEF1 promotes androgen receptor expression and activity in an androgen-independent manner, ultimately increasing prostate cancer growth regardless of androgen ablation therapy. In this review, we review LEF1 regulation, its role in tumorigenesis in several cancer types, and its clinical value as a biomarker for predicting prognoses and as a target for treatment.",,['NOTNLM'],"['LEF1', 'WNT', 'cancer', 'prognosis', 'prostate', 'treatment']",,,PMC5489786,,,,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulating aerobic glycolysis can alter multiple metabolic and signaling pathways in cancer cells, and trigger unlimited growth and proliferation. Accumulating evidence suggests that elevated levels of protein modification with beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) along with dysregulation of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and/or O-GlcNAcase (OGA) levels may act as a nutrient sensor in cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism of O-GlcNAcylation and the relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and glycolysis are largely unknown in pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (pre-B-ALL). In this study, CD19(+) bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) from untreated pre-B-ALL patients displayed increased O-GlcNAcylation levels, upregulated OGT, and downregulated OGA. Patients with higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels exhibited higher O-GlcNAcylation levels with OGT upregulation and overactivation of the PI3K/Akt/c-Myc pathway. The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and the mRNA expression of key enzymes in glycolysis were determined to assess glycolysis activation. Our results revealed the existence of abnormal glycolysis in the CD19(+) BM-MNCs of pre-B-ALL patients. The knockdown of OGT decreased the ECAR and downregulated glycolysis-related enzymes in Nalm-6 cells via the PI3K/Akt/c-Myc pathway. The suppression of OGT slowed the rate of proliferation and induced apoptosis in Nalm-6 cells.

The present study reports a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a healthcare provider who was exposed to radiation at work; we also present a literature review of this topic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old patient, who had been a radiation oncologist and had been exposed to radiation while performing brachytherapy 10 years ago, complained of chest pain and was suspected of having leukemia based on the results of a blood test in an outpatient clinic. He was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and subsequently underwent chemotherapy. However, the case died during treatment. Through epidemiological investigation, it was found that the case's cumulative exposure dose based on personal exposure and spatial dose measured during the work period was in the range of 6.08-12.15 mSv. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the following considerations, acute lymphoblastic leukemia was highly correlated with the level of radiation to which the case was exposed while performing brachytherapy on patients with cancer. Firstly, the latent period of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the case closely matched the latency time reported in previous published studies (5-10 years). In addition, numerous studies have reported significantly higher relative risks of cancer among clinicians who perform RT compared with the general population. The case was also atypically exposed to radiation through his hands, despite wearing protective equipment. Lastly, the case's coworkers were also found to have been exposed to high levels of radiation. Investigation into the influence of radiation exposure through atypical routes during RT on the health of clinicians is recommended.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Brachytherapy', 'Cesium', 'Radiation oncologist']",,,PMC5485618,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3449-5171'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a typical member of KRAB-ZNFs, dysregulation of ZNF300 contributes to multiple pathologies such as leukemia and cancer. However, mechanisms underlying ZNF300 tight regulation and its pathophysiological function remain largely unknown. METHODS: The effect of ZNF300ZFR on gene transcriptional activity was measured by Dual luciferase reporter system. ChIP-PCR assay were performed to detect the enrichment of ZNF300 protein and H3K9Ac in the ZNF300 gene. Co-immunoprecipitation assays followed by western blot were performed to detect the interaction between ZNF300 and KAP1. The DNA methylation in the ZNF300 gene promoter was analyzed by BSP. ZNF300 function on K562 cell differentiation was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In this study, we found that the zinc finger domain-encoding region (ZFR) of ZNF300 functioned as a repressor possibly by mediating DNA methylation and ZNF300 bound to its ZNF300ZFR, suggesting a potential auto-inhibition mechanism. To support this, DNA methylation inhibition upregulated ZNF300 expression and ZNF300 overexpression inhibited endogenous ZNF300 expression. More importantly, DNA methylation inhibition restored megakaryocyte differentiation in K562 cells suppressed by ZNF300 downregulation, suggesting an important role of DNA methylation in ZNF300 function. Interestingly, ZNF300 knockdown restored global H3K9Ac that was reduced in K562 cells undergoing megakaryocyte differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed novel features of ZNF300 that possibly mediate its regulation and function by modulating epigenetic modifications.",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Histone acetylation', 'KRAB-ZFP', 'ZNF300']",,,PMC5490171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCM can be observed with any type of tumor in children and occurs most commonly with leukemia. While HCM is a potentially fatal condition, the prevalence of HCM is not well understood in pediatric cancer patients. METHODS: Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified pediatric cancer patients with recorded corrected serum calcium (CSC) from 2003 through 2014. Hypercalcemic patients (CSC >/=10.8 mg/dL) were classified into 4 CSC levels. We estimated the annual prevalence of HCM using Byar's method. RESULTS: Among 517 pediatric cancer patients, leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors were the most frequent cancer types. The prevalence of HCM overall (grade 1 or higher) ranged from 0.24% to 0.81% between 2003 and 2014. There were too few cases to compare prevalence by type of cancer. CONCLUSION: We provide the first systematic analysis using a UK population-based data source to estimate the number of pediatric cancer patients affected with HCM by grade. Our findings showed that the prevalence of pediatric HCM was very low (0.24%-0.81%) over the 12-year study period, which is consistent with previous study of adult cancer patients in the UK (0.20%-0.67%).",,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical Practice Research Datalink', 'cancer', 'hypercalcemia', 'pediatric', 'prevalence']",,,PMC5479301,,,,,,"['Disclosure This study was funded by Amgen Inc.

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). The HTLV-1-encoded protein Tax plays important roles in the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells by affecting cellular proteins. In this study, we showed that Tax transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally downregulates the expression of the tumor suppressor gene B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B), which encodes a lymphoid-related transcription factor. BCL11B expression was downregulated in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels, and forced expression of BCL11B suppressed the proliferation of these cells. The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 increased BCL11B expression in HTLV-1-infected cell lines, and colocalization of Tax with BCL11B was detected in the cytoplasm of HTLV-1-infected T-cells following MG132 treatment. shRNA knock-down of Tax expression also increased the expression of BCL11B in HTLV-1-infected cells. Moreover, we found that Tax physically binds to BCL11B protein and induces the polyubiquitination of BCL11B and proteasome-dependent degradation of BCL11B. Thus, inactivation of BCL11B by Tax protein may play an important role in the Tax-mediated leukemogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In univariate analysis, age >/=60, ALIP, >/=5% CD34+ cells, CD34+ clusters and IPSS-R subgroups were associated with shorter OS (p = 0.027, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively) and PFS (p = 0.029, p = 0.006, p = 0.001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively). Haemoglobin level had a significant impact on OS (p < 0.0001) but not on PFS (p = 0.054). In multivariate analysis, ALIP, haemoglobin level, >/=5% CD34+ cells, CD34+ clusters and IPSS-R subgroups had independent influence on OS (p = 0.012, p < 0.0001, p = 0.010, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively), while only CD34+ clusters and IPSS-R subgroups had independent influence on PFS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.016, respectively). In different IPSS-R subgroups, ALIP could maintain its prognostic impact in lower IPSS-R risk subgroups, while >/=5% CD34+ cells and CD34+ clusters had significant prognostic value in both lower and intermediate-higher IPSS-R risk subgroups.

Mechanistically, elevated ILF2 expression exerts resistance to genotoxic agents by modulating YB-1 nuclear localization and interaction with the splicing factor U2AF65, which promotes mRNA processing and the stabilization of transcripts involved in homologous recombination in response to DNA damage.

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"Clonal hematopoiesis results from somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, which give an advantage to mutant cells, driving their clonal expansion and potentially leading to leukemia. The acquisition of clonal hematopoiesis-driver mutations (CHDMs) occurs with normal aging and these mutations have been detected in more than 10% of individuals >/=65 years. We aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of CHDMs throughout adult life. We developed a targeted re-sequencing assay combining high-throughput with ultra-high sensitivity based on single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs). Using smMIPs, we screened more than 100 loci for CHDMs in more than 2,000 blood DNA samples from population controls between 20 and 69 years of age. Loci screened included 40 regions known to drive clonal hematopoiesis when mutated and 64 novel candidate loci. We identified 224 somatic mutations throughout our cohort, of which 216 were coding mutations in known driver genes (DNMT3A, JAK2, GNAS, TET2, and ASXL1), including 196 point mutations and 20 indels. Our assay's improved sensitivity allowed us to detect mutations with variant allele frequencies as low as 0.001. CHDMs were identified in more than 20% of individuals 60 to 69 years of age and in 3% of individuals 20 to 29 years of age, approximately double the previously reported prevalence despite screening a limited set of loci.

OBJECTIVE: The work was aimed to (i) determine the anti-tumor and chemosensitizing activity of the novel racemic spirocyclic hydroxamic acids using experimental drug sensitive leukemia P388 of mice, and (ii) determine the structure-activity relationships as metal chelating and HDAC inhibitory agents. METHOD: Outbreed male rat of 200-220 g weights were used in biochemical experiments. In vivo experiments were performed using the BDF1 hybrid male mice of 22-24 g weight. Lipid peroxidation, Fe (II) -chelating activity, HDAC fluorescent activity, anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity, acute toxicity techniques were used in this study. RESULTS: Chemosensitizing properties of water soluble cyclic hydroxamic acids (CHA) are evaluated using in vitro activities and in vivo methods and found significant results. These compounds possess iron (II) chelating properties, and slightly inhibit lipid peroxidation. CHA prepared from triacetonamine (1a-e) are more effective Fe (II) ions cheaters, as compared to CHA prepared from 1- methylpiperidone (2a-e). The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity, lipophilicity and acute toxicity were influenced by the length amino acids (size) (Glycine < Alanine < Valine < Leucine < Phenylalanine). All compounds bearing spiro-N-methylpiperidine ring (2a-e) are non-toxic up to 1250 mg/kg dose, while compounds bearing spiro-tetramethylpiperidine ring (1a-e) exhibit moderate toxicity which increases with increasing lipophility, but not excite at 400 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: It was shown that the use of combination of non-toxic doses of cisplatin (cPt) or cyclophosphamide with CHA in most cases result in the appearance of a considerable anti-tumor effect of cytostatics. The highest chemosensitizing activity with respect to leukemia capital ER, Cyrillic388 is demonstrated by the CHA derivatives of Valine 1c or 2c.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HDAC inhibitory activity', '*chemosensitizing property', '*combination chemotherapy', '*histone deacetylases', '*hydroxamic acid', '*lymphatic leukemia.']",,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alemtuzumab is registered for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is also used in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Alemtuzumab is used off-label in kidney transplantation as induction and anti-rejection therapy. The objective of this review is to present a review of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and use of alemtuzumab in kidney transplantation. A systematic literature search was conducted using Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials. No pharmacokinetic or dose-finding studies of alemtuzumab have been performed in kidney transplantation. Although such studies were conducted in patients with CLL and MS, these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to transplant recipients, because CLL patients have a much higher load of CD52-positive cells and, therefore, target-mediated clearance will differ between these two indications. Alemtuzumab used as induction therapy in kidney transplantation results in a lower incidence of acute rejection compared to basiliximab therapy and comparable results as compared with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG). Alemtuzumab used as anti-rejection therapy results in a comparable graft survival rate compared with rATG, although infusion-related side effects appear to be less. There is a need for pharmacokinetic and dose-finding studies of alemtuzumab in kidney transplant recipients to establish the optimal balance between efficacy and toxicity.

Epub 2017 Jul 1.,"Ensemble-based virtual screening using different conformations of a target protein is gaining popularity, as it can leverage information from target flexibility for effective lead identification. In this paper, molecular dynamics simulation followed by RMSD-based clustering was employed to generate and choose distinct conformations of Bcr-Abl. Three representative structures from the most-populated clusters along with the crystal structure conformation (PDBID: 3K5V) were used to perform docking-based virtual screening of 14,400 compounds (in the Maybridge database) in order to identify potential allosteric site binders. Seven compounds found as hits in at least three of the four virtual screenings had higher Glide docking scores than the co-crystallized allosteric inhibitor GNF-2. Detailed computational analyses of the seven hits identified SEW02675 (DeltaG bind = -164.92 kJ/mol with the wild-type (wt) Bcr-Abl and -167.37 kJ/mol with the T334I Bcr-Abl mutant) as a better allosteric site binder with both the wt and the mutant Bcr-Abl protein than the reference allosteric inhibitor GNF-2 (DeltaG bind = -103.12 with wt and -142.96 kJ/mol with T334I). Moreover, the presence of SEW02675 in the allosteric site enhanced the binding of imatinib (DeltaG bind = -367.58 with wt and -294.56 kJ/mol with T334I) to the ATP sites of the wt and the mutant Bcr-Abl. However, when GNF-2 was present in the allosteric site, the binding of imatinib (DeltaG bind = -351.76 with wt and -273.94 kJ/mol with T334I) to the ATP site was weaker. The in silico findings suggest that SEW02675 could be used in combination with imatinib to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, and that it could help to overcome resistance due to T334I Bcr-Abl mutation.

Complete remission, judged by morphology and cytogenetic analysis, was achieved after the conventional chemotherapy. Eight months after completion of therapy, the level of WT-1 in peripheral blood and the number of cells with the MLL-ELL fusion transcript resurged. However, the patient remained overtly healthy and the morphology in the bone-marrow smear was innocuous, with no sign of relapse or secondary leukemia. Without any evidence of relapse, the patient has been closely observed without any therapeutic intervention. For approximately 2 years after the completion of therapy, despite clonal proliferation of pre-leukemic cells with an MLL-ELL fusion gene, she has maintained complete remission.

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Recipients of ex vivo T cell-depleted (TCD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are at risk of infection by double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. We report rates of dsDNA viremia, end-organ disease (EOD), infection-related mortality, and overall survival (OS) in a contemporary cohort of adult TCD HCT recipients routinely monitored for cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Healthcare utilization in the first 6 months post-HCT was compared between patients with dsDNA viremia versus no viremia. This was an observational study of adult patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who received CD34(+) selected, peripheral blood HCT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from March 2012 through December 2014. Patients were prospectively monitored by quantitative PCR assays for CMV, ADV, HHV6, and EBV in whole blood or plasma. The cumulative incidence of viremia(s) at day +180, EOD at 1 year, and OS at 1 year were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test among patient with and without viremia/EOD. Standardized incidence ratios were used to compare overall length of hospital stay (LOS), number of readmissions after HCT, and length of readmissions through day +180. Of 156 patients, 96 (62%) were CMV recipient seropositive. Forty-two patients received grafts from matched related (27%), 86 from matched unrelated (55%), and 28 from mismatched (18%) donors. Overall, 132 patients (85%) had >/=1 viremia and 52 (33%) >/=2 viremias by day +180. The cumulative incidences for CMV, HHV6, ADV, and EBV viremia were 44%, 61%, 7%, and 16%, respectively, with median times of onset 28 days (interquartile range [IQR], 25 to 33), 33 days (IQR, 25 to 47), 60 days (IQR, 19 to 84), and 79 days (IQR, 54 to 106) post-HCT, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (18%) developed EOD by dsDNA viruses at 1 year post-HCT. Treatment for CMV accounted for 91% total antiviral treatment-days. Compared with patients with no viremia, patients with CMV viremia, HHV6 viremia, or >/=2 viremias experienced longer LOS (P <.001) and a higher number of readmissions (P <.001) by day +180. OS rate at 1 year was 79% and was similar between patients with or without dsDNA viremias. EOD was associated with lower 1-year OS rates (63.4%) versus without EOD (81.1%) (P = .02). Of 33 patients who died, 10 died due to infection, and 7 of these infection-related deaths were due to dsDNA viruses. Viremia by dsDNA viruses occurred in 85% of TCD HCT recipients by day +100 and 33% of patients experienced >/=2 viremias by day +180. CMV accounted for most antiviral use. CMV, HHV6, or >/=2 viremias were associated with more readmissions and longer LOS. One year OS rate was 78%. EOD by dsDNA viruses was associated with decreased 1-year OS. Infections by dsDNA viruses pose a substantial burden after TCD HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We report here two cases of myeloid sarcomas in patients with, respectively, a polycythemia vera and a myelodysplastic syndrome. CASE REPORTS: The first is an 81-year-old woman who presented with osteolytic lesions. Diagnosis has been highlighted using anatomopathological study after bone marrow biopsy, but it was delayed because of a very localized basin lesion and few positive myeloid markers. The second patient is an 86-year-old man who presented with pancytopenia and several lymph nodes. Lymph node cytology failed because of the rarity of blast cells. Diagnosis was done after anatomopathological study on lymph node biopsy which revealed a localized form of myeloid sarcoma. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma must be considered when unusual tumors occur in patients with a chronic myeloid disease. In that case, therapeutic options are those of an acute myeloid leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) develops when there is a block in differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid precursors, resulting in bone marrow failure. AML is a clinically, morphologically, and genetically heterogeneous disease, and biological differences between adult and childhood AML have been identified. AML comprises 15%-20% of all children <15 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia. Relapse occurs in up to 40% of children with AML and is the most common cause of death. Relapse arises from leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that persist after conventional chemotherapy. The treatment of AML is challenging, and new strategies to target LSCs are required. The cell surface marker CD33 has been identified as a therapeutic target, and novel anti-CD33 immunotherapies are promising new agents in the treatment of AML. This review summarizes recent developments emphasizing the genetic differences in adult and childhood AML and highlights the rationale for CD33 as a target for therapy in all age groups.","['Copyright (c) 2017 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

This variation might reflect differences in diagnostic capability, inherited susceptibility, and infectious exposures. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor lesion that can be screened for in apparently healthy people, allowing comparison of prevalence across different populations independently of health-care provision. We aimed to compare the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of MBL in age-and-sex-matched populations from rural Uganda and the UK. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited volunteers aged at least 45 years who were seronegative for HIV-1 from the established Ugandan General Population Cohort and obtained their whole-blood samples. We also obtained blood samples from anonymised waste material of age-and-sex-matched individuals (aged >45 years, with a normal blood count and no history of cancer) in the UK. We used flow cytometry to determine the presence of MBL, defined according to standard diagnostic criteria, in the samples and compared differences in the proportion of cases with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)-phenotype MBL and CD5-negative MBL, as well as differences in absolute monoclonal B-cell count between the two cohorts. FINDINGS: Between Jan 15 and Dec 18, 2012, we obtained samples from 302 Ugandan volunteers and 302 UK individuals who were matched by age and sex to the Ugandan population. Overall MBL prevalence was higher in the Ugandan participants (42 [14%] individuals) than in the UK cohort (25 [8%]; p=0.038). CLL-phenotype MBL was detected in three (1%) Ugandan participants and 21 (7%) UK participants (p=0.00021); all three Ugandan participants had absolute monoclonal B-cell count below one cell per muL, whereas the 21 UK participants had a median absolute number of circulating neoplastic cells of 4.6 (IQR 2-12) cells per muL. The prevalence of CD5-negative MBL was higher in the Ugandan cohort (41 [14%], of whom two [5%] also had CLL-phenotype MBL) than in the UK cohort (six [2%], of whom two [33%] also had CLL-phenotype MBL; p<0.0001), but the median absolute B-cell count was similar (227 [IQR 152-345] cells per muL in the Ugandan cohort vs 135 [105-177] cells per muL in the UK cohort; p=0.13). INTERPRETATION: MBL is common in both Uganda and the UK, but the substantial phenotypic differences might reflect fundamental differences in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.

Epub 2017 Jun 26.,"Human pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG) plays an essential role in the development and progression of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL). PTTG has two SH3-binding peptide motifs that can be recognized by a variety of SH3-containing proteins in the pALL through peptide-mediated interactions. In this study, the gene expression profile of pALL was examined in detail by integrating computational modeling and experimental assay, aiming to identify those potential partner proteins of human PTTG. The binding potency of domain candidates to peptide motifs was ranked using knowledge-based scoring and fluorescence titration. A number of SH3 domains found in a variety of pALL proteins were identified as potent binders with moderate or high affinity for PTTG. It is revealed that the PTTG peptide motifs show different affinity profiles for various candidate proteins, indicating that the PTTG selectivity is optimized across pALL gene expression space. The PTTG peptides were then mutated rationally to target the SH3 domains of identified partner proteins by competing with the native peptide motifs.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jun 16.,"OBJECTIVE: The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, approximately one third of patients are resistant to TKI and/or progress to advanced disease stages. TKI therapy failure has a well-known association with ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutations, but only around half of TKI non-responders have detectable ABL1 KD mutations. METHOD: We attempt to identify genetic markers associated with TKI therapy failure in 13 patients (5 resistant, 8 progressed) without ABL1 KD mutations using whole-exome sequencing. RESULTS: In 6 patients, we detected mutations in 6 genes commonly mutated in other myeloid neoplasms: ABL1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, IDH1, SETBP1, and TP63. We then used targeted deep sequencing to validate our finding in an independent cohort consisting of 100 CML patients with varying drug responses (74 responsive, 18 resistant, and 8 progressed patients). Mutations in genes associated with epigenetic regulations such as DNMT3A and ASXL1 seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of CML progression and TKI-resistance independent of ABL1 KD mutations. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the involvement of other somatic mutations in the development of TKI resistant progression to advanced disease stages in CML, particularly in patients lacking ABL1 KD mutations.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Inhibitors to FLT3 have already been tested in clinical trials, however, drug resistance limits clinical efficacy. Mutant receptor tyrosine kinases are mislocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of AML and play an important role in the non-canonical activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Here, we have tested a potent new drug called imipramine blue (IB), which is a chimeric molecule with a dual mechanism of action. At 200-300 nM concentrations, IB is a potent inhibitor of STAT5 through liberation of endogenous phosphatase activity following NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibition. However, at 75-150 nM concentrations, IB was highly effective at killing mutant FLT3-driven AML cells through a similar mechanism as thapsigargin (TG), involving increased cytosolic calcium. IB also potently inhibited survival of primary human FLT3/ITD(+) AML cells compared to FLT3/ITD(neg) cells and spared normal umbilical cord blood cells. Therefore, IB functions through a mechanism involving vulnerability to dysregulated calcium metabolism and the combination of fusing a lipophilic amine to a NOX inhibiting dye shows promise for further pre-clinical development for targeting high risk AML.",,,,"['R01 AR047901/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'OGG85SX4E4 (Imipramine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",PMC5493614,,,,,['Fed Regist. 2017 Nov 27;82(226):56042-56043.

Epub 2017 Jun 30.,"Induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is widely believed to contribute to beta-cell death in type 1 diabetes (T1D). MCL-1 is an antiapoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family, whose depletion causes apoptosis in rodent beta-cells in vitro. Importantly, decreased MCL-1 expression was observed in islets from patients with T1D. We report here that MCL-1 downregulation is associated with cytokine-mediated killing of human beta-cells, a process partially prevented by MCL-1 overexpression. By generating a beta-cell-specific Mcl-1 knockout mouse strain (betaMcl-1KO), we observed that, surprisingly, MCL-1 ablation does not affect islet development and function. beta-Cells from betaMcl-1KO mice were, however, more susceptible to cytokine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, betaMcl-1KO mice displayed higher hyperglycemia and lower pancreatic insulin content after multiple low-dose streptozotocin treatment. We found that the kinase GSK3beta, the E3 ligases MULE and betaTrCP, and the deubiquitinase USP9x regulate cytokine-mediated MCL-1 protein turnover in rodent beta-cells.

Epub 2017 Jun 30.,"T-3775440 is an irreversible inhibitor of the chromatin demethylase LSD1, which exerts antiproliferative effects by disrupting the interaction between LSD1 and GFI1B, a SNAG domain transcription factor, inducing leukemia cell transdifferentiation. Here, we describe the anticancer effects and mechanism of action of T-3775440 in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). T-3775440 inhibited proliferation of SCLC cells in vitro and retarded SCLC tumor growth in vivo T-3775440 disrupted the interaction between LSD1 and the transcriptional repressor INSM1, thereby inhibiting expression of neuroendocrine-associated genes, such as ASCL1 INSM1 silencing phenocopied the effects of T-3775440 on gene expression and cell proliferation, consistent with the likelihood T-3775440 mediated its effects in SCLC by inhibiting INSM1. T-3775440 also inhibited proliferation of an SCLC cell line that overexpressed GFI1B, rather than INSM1, by disrupting the interaction between LSD1 and GFI1B. Taken together, our results argue that LSD1 plays an important role in neuroendocrine-associated transcription and cell proliferation of SCLC via interactions with the SNAG domain proteins INSM1 and GFI1B. Targeting these critical interactions with LSD1 inhibitors offers a novel rational strategy to therapeutically manage SCLC. Cancer Res; 77(17); 4652-62.

Epub 2017 May 10.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) improves local control of leukemia/lymphoma with central nervous system (CNS) involvement; however, for adult patients anticipating stem cell transplant (SCT), cumulative treatment toxicity is a major concern. We evaluated toxicities and outcomes for patients receiving proton or photon CSI before SCT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 37 consecutive leukemia/lymphoma patients with CNS involvement who received CSI before SCT at our institution. Photon versus proton toxicities during CSI, transplant, and through 100 days posttransplant were compared using Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Long-term neurotoxicity, disease response, and overall survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (23 photon, 14 proton) underwent CSI for CNS involvement of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (49%), acute myeloblastic leukemia (22%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), chronic myelocytic leukemia (14%), lymphoma (11%), and myeloma (3%). CSI was used for consolidation (30 patients, 81%) and gross disease treatment (7 patients, 19%). Median radiation dose (interquartile range) was 24 Gy (23.4-24) for photons and 21.8 Gy (21.3-23.6) for protons (P = .03). Proton CSI was associated with lower rates of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-3 mucositis during CSI (7% vs 44%, P = .03): 1 grade 3 with protons versus 5 grade 1, 3 grade 2, and 2 grade 3 with photons. During CSI, other toxicities (infection, gastrointestinal symptoms) did not differ. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) was used in 95% of patients, with 53% of patients in remission before SCT. Myeloablative conditioning was used for 76%. During SCT admission and 100 days post-SCT, toxicities did not differ by CSI technique. Successful engraftment occurred in 95% of patients (P = .67). Progression or death occurred for 47% of patients, with only 1 CNS relapse. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, CSI offered excellent local control for CNS-involved hematologic malignancies in the pre-SCT setting. Acute mucositis occurred less frequently with proton CSI with comparable peritransplant/long-term toxicity profile, suggesting the need to further explore the benefit/toxicity profile of this technique.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

Epub 2017 Jun 27.,"Following approval in 1997 of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab for the treatment of B-NHL and CLL, many other unconjugated IgG1 MAbs have been tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials for the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms. Relatively few have been approved however and these are directed against a limited number of target antigens (CD20, CD52, CCR4, CD38, CD319). We review here the known biological properties of these antibodies and discuss which factors may have led to their success or may, on the contrary, limit their clinical application. Common factors of the approved MAbs are that the target antigen is expressed at relatively high levels on the neoplastic targets and their mechanism of action is mostly immune-mediated. Indeed most of these MAbs induce ADCC and phagocytosis by macrophages, and many also activate complement, leading to target cell lysis. In contrast direct cell death induction is not a common feature but may enhance efficacy in some cases. Interestingly, a key factor for the success of several MAbs appears to be their capacity to skew immunity towards an anti-tumour mode, by inhibiting/depleting suppressor cells and/or activating immune cells within the microenvironment, independently of FcgammaRs. We also expose here some of the strategies employed by industry to expand the clinical use of these molecules beyond their original indication. Interestingly, due to the central role of lymphocytes in the control of the immune response, several of the antibodies are now successfully used to treat many different autoimmune diseases and have also been formally approved for some of these new indications. There is little doubt that this trend will continue and that the precise mechanisms of therapeutic MAbs will be further dissected and better understood in the context of both tumour immunology and autoimmunity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent era has witnessed an explosive information about the molecular pathophysiology of AML. By early identification of patients at a high risk of relapse, it is expected that a majority of eligible patients will receive HCT in first complete remission.

Advancements in immunotherapy have led to the development of several monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that are capable of targeting certain surface antigens on leukemic cells, resulting in their destruction. Areas covered: This article reviews the mechanism of action, outcomes of various trials, and adverse effects of MoAbs and CAR-T cells used in the treatment of precursor B-cell ALL. Expert commentary: Some of the immunotherapeutic agents that have been approved for the treatment of R/R precursor B-cell ALL have shown superior efficacy and safety profile compared to chemotherapy in advanced disease. Several trials are now being conducted to evaluate the role of certain MoAbs in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of B-cell ALL. Additionally, their use in the frontline setting with more favorable host characteristics may also result in superior outcomes compared to the current standard of care.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*blinatumomab', '*chimeric antigen receptor T cells', '*epratuzumab', '*immunotherapy', '*inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*precursor B-cell', '*refractory/relapsed', '*rituximab']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0088-5438'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are essential to maintain chromosomal integrity and genome stability. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex containing an internal RNA template (hTR) and a catalytic subunit (hTERT). The human hTR gene consists of three major domains; among them the H/ACA domain is essential for telomere biogenesis. H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is composed of four evolutionary conserved proteins, including dyskerin (encoded by DKC1 gene), NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1. In this study, we have evaluated the expression profile of the H/ACA RNP complex genes: DKC1, NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1, as well as hTERT and hTR mRNA levels, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Results were correlated with the number and type of genetic alteration detected by conventional cytogenetics and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region) mutational status, telomere length (TL) and clinico-pathological characteristics of patients. Our results showed significant decreased expression of GAR1, NOP10, DKC1 and hTR, as well as increased mRNA levels of hTERT in patients compared to controls (p</=0.04). A positive correlation between the expression of GAR1-NHP2, GAR1-NOP10, and NOP10-NHP2 (p<0.0001), were observed. The analysis taking into account prognostic factors showed a significant increased expression of hTERT gene in unmutated-IGHV cases compared to mutated-CLL patients (p = 0.0185). The comparisons among FISH groups exhibited increased expression of DKC1 in cases with two or more alterations with respect to no abnormalities, trisomy 12 and del13q14, and of NHP2 and NOP10 compared to those with del13q14 (p = 0.03). The analysis according to TL showed a significant increased expression of hTERT (p = 0.0074) and DKC1 (p = 0.0036) in patients with short telomeres compared to those with long TL. No association between gene expression and clinical parameters was found. Our results suggest a role for these telomere associated genes in genomic instability and telomere dysfunction in CLL.",,,,,['0 (Ribonucleoproteins)'],PMC5493334,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6607-7620'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

leukemia (APL) via its ability to induce the in vivo differentiation of APL blasts. However, prolonged ATRA treatment can result in drug resistance. In previous studies, we generated a multi-drug-resistant HL60/ATRA cell line and found it to contain a new drug resistance-related gene segment, HA117. In this study, we demonstrate that ATRA induces multi-drug-resistant subpopulations of HL60 cells with a putative stem-like signature by up-regulating the expression of the new gene segment HA117. Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that HA117 causes alternative splicing of regulator of G-protein signaling 6 (RGS6) and down-regulation of the expression of the GGL domain of RGS6, which plays an important role in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) degradation. Moreover, DNMT1 expression was increased in multi-drug resistance HL60/ATRA cells. Knockdown of HA117 restored expression of the GGL domain and blocked DNMT1 expression. Moreover, resistant cells displayed a putative stem-like signature with increased expression of cancer steam cell markers CD133 and CD123. The stem cell marker, Nanog, was significantly up-regulated. In conclusion, our study shows that HA117 potentially promotes the stem-like signature of the HL60/ATRA cell line by inhibiting by the ubiquitination and degradation of DNMT1 and by down-regulating the expression of the GGL domain of RGS6.

Epub 2017 Aug 10.,"OBJECTIVE: Acute leukemia (AL) is associated with an immediate threat to life, an unpredictable clinical course, and substantial physical suffering. Traumatic stress symptoms that may meet criteria for acute stress disorder (ASD) may be common and disabling in this context, but have received little clinical attention. We investigated the incidence over time and risk factors for traumatic stress symptoms and ASD in the 3 months following diagnosis or relapse of AL. METHODS: Individuals with AL were recruited at a tertiary cancer center in Canada within one month of diagnosis or relapse. Participants (N = 230) completed self-report measures, including the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, at baseline and monthly over 3 months. The incidence of traumatic stress symptoms over time was examined, and a generalized logistic model was used to identify factors associated with ASD. RESULTS: Participants were 60% male, with a mean age of 48.9 +/- 15.2 years. Symptoms of ASD were identified on >/=1 assessment over the study period in 24.4% of participants at baseline and in an additional 12.6% at a subsequent follow-up. Of these, 55.3% reported symptoms on >/=2 assessments. ASD was associated with having young children, being unmarried, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and greater physical symptom burden. Persistent or recurrent ASD was associated with female sex, acute lymphocytic leukemia, greater attachment anxiety, less spiritual well-being, and less satisfactory patient-clinician communication. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of ASD are common and often persist or recur following diagnosis or relapse of AL. Research is urgently needed to determine the impact of interventions to prevent and treat psychological distress in this population.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute stress disorder', '*cancer', '*hematology', '*leukemia', '*oncology', '*palliative care', '*psychosocial', '*traumatic stress']",['MOP 84317/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 15-year-old boy with a history of high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia status post-chemotherapy presented with acute changes in vision in his left eye. Fundus examination revealed a white bi-lobed chorioretinal lesion with overlying vitritis and associated subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed small ring-enhancing lesions in the right parietal and left occipital lobes. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous, and vitreous cultures were all negative. Bone marrow and vitreous cytology were negative for malignant cells. The patient was treated for presumed fungal endophthalmitis with systemic and intravitreal voriconazole, followed by pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal voriconazole and amphotericin B injections. The chorioretinal lesion resolved and visual acuity recovered to 20/20.

The hallmark of ALL is chromosomal abnormalities and genetic alterations involved in differentiation and proliferation of lymphoid precursor cells. In adults, 75% of cases develop from precursors of the B-cell lineage, with the remainder of cases consisting of malignant T-cell precursors. Traditionally, risk stratification has been based on clinical factors such age, white blood cell count and response to chemotherapy; however, the identification of recurrent genetic alterations has helped refine individual prognosis and guide management. Despite advances in management, the backbone of therapy remains multi-agent chemotherapy with vincristine, corticosteroids and an anthracycline with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible candidates. Elderly patients are often unable to tolerate such regimens and carry a particularly poor prognosis. Here, we review the major recent advances in the treatment of ALL.",,,,,,PMC5520400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This standard treatment results in complete remission (CR) in the majority of AML patients. However, despite these high CR rates, only 30-40% (<60 years) and 10-20% (>60 years) of patients survive five years after diagnosis. The main cause of this treatment failure is insufficient eradication of a subpopulation of chemotherapy resistant leukemic cells with stem cell-like properties, often referred to as ""leukemic stem cells"" (LSCs). LSCs co-exist in the bone marrow of the AML patient with residual healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are needed to reconstitute the blood after therapy. To prevent relapse, development of additional therapies targeting LSCs, while sparing HSCs, is essential. As LSCs are rare, heterogeneous and dynamic, these cells are extremely difficult to target by single gene therapies. Modulation of miRNAs and consequently the regulation of hundreds of their targets may be the key to successful elimination of resistant LSCs, either by inducing apoptosis or by sensitizing them for chemotherapy. To address the need for specific targeting of LSCs, miRNA expression patterns in highly enriched HSCs, LSCs, and leukemic progenitors, all derived from the same patients' bone marrow, were determined and differentially expressed miRNAs between LSCs and HSCs and between LSCs and leukemic progenitors were identified. Several of these miRNAs are specifically expressed in LSCs and/or HSCs and associated with AML prognosis and treatment outcome. In this review, we will focus on the expression and function of miRNAs expressed in normal and leukemic stem cells that are residing within the AML bone marrow. Moreover, we will review their possible prospective as specific targets for anti-LSC therapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MicroRNAs', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemic stem cells']",,,PMC5532610,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

ArtinM, a d-mannose-binding lectin from Artocarpus heterophyllus, activates antigen-presenting cells by recognizing TLR2 N-glycans and induces Th1 immunity. We recently demonstrated that ArtinM stimulated CD4(+) T cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we further studied the effects of ArtinM on adaptive immune cells. We showed that ArtinM activates murine CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, augmenting their positivity for CD25, CD69, and CD95 and showed higher interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production. The CD4(+) T cells exhibited increased T-bet expression in response to ArtinM, and IL-2 production by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells depended on the recognition of CD3epsilongamma-chain glycans by ArtinM. The ArtinM effect on aberrantly-glycosylated neoplastic lymphocytes was studied in Jurkat T cells, in which ArtinM induced IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta production, but decreased cell viability and growth. A higher frequency of AnnexinV- and propidium iodide-stained cells demonstrated the induction of Jurkat T cells apoptosis by ArtinM, and this apoptotic response was reduced by caspases and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ArtinM effects on murine T cells corroborated with the immunomodulatory property of lectin, whereas the promotion of Jurkat T cells apoptosis may reflect a potential applicability of ArtinM in novel strategies for treating lymphocytic leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ArtinM', 'CD4+ and CD8+ T cells', 'Jurkat T cells', 'immunomodulation', 'lectins']",,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",PMC5535893,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used a multipotent murine cell line to generate sufficient numbers of cells undergoing self-renewal, erythroid or myeloid differentiation to allow a proteomics analysis of enriched mitochondria. Stringent analysis identified 37 mitochondria-associated proteins changing on differentiation in this system. Those induced during differentiation were commonly associated with mature cell functions, while those inactivated upon differentiation indicate widespread changes in mitochondrial transport, fatty acid catabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. An erythroid specific reduction in glutamate pyruvate amino transferase 2 was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting and at the functional level by assays of metabolite turnover. In addition to validating the dataset, these findings suggest significant differences in the core-metabolism between erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. This knowledge is of relevance to the in vitro production of cell therapy products and to studies of the interdependence of metabolic and signaling pathways in regenerative tissues.

Recurrent mutations in tumor-suppressor genes (TP53, BIRC3, ATM), and common signaling pathways, such as the B-cell receptor (CD79A, CD79B, CARD11, TCF3, ID3), Toll-like receptor (MYD88), NOTCH (NOTCH1/2), nuclear factor-kappaB, and mitogen activated kinase signaling, have been identified in B-cell neoplasms. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, hairy cell leukemia, and marginal zone lymphomas of splenic, nodal, and extranodal types represent examples of B-cell neoplasms in which novel molecular biomarkers have been discovered in recent years. In addition, ongoing retrospective correlative and prospective outcome studies have resulted in an enhanced understanding of the clinical utility of novel biomarkers. This progress is reflected in the 2016 update of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms, which lists as many as 41 mature B-cell neoplasms (including provisional categories).

Many of them are poor candidates for intensive chemo-immunotherapy regimens, such as FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab). Still, most clinical trials aim to enroll 'fit' patients, who poorly represent the community oncology population. Areas covered: In the past decade, bendamustine hydrochloride, a cytotoxic agent with structural similarities to both alkylating agents and purine analogs, has received widespread use in therapy of NHL and CLL, and has demonstrated a relatively favorable toxicity profile. However, bendamustine has not been well studied in patients with hematologic malignancies who have comorbidities. Here we review the clinical data on use of bendamustine in older and unfit patients with NHL and CLL, and analyze whether there is an optimal dose of bendamustine in patients who have significant comorbidities, including renal dysfunction. Expert commentary: Reduced intensity regimens of bendamustine are effective in CLL patients with comorbidities and renal dysfunction. Even with the introduction of targeted therapies, bendamustine will likely continue to be an important therapeutic option in patients with comorbidities because of its tolerability, efficacy and cost.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', '*cumulative illness risk scale (CIRS)', '*dose reduction', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)', '*renal insufficiency', '*therapy']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, drug development has not kept pace, as the '7+3' induction regimen remains the standard of care for patients fit for intensive therapy 40 years after its first use. Temporal improvements in overall survival were mostly confined to younger patients and driven by improvements in supportive care and use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Multiple forms of novel therapy are currently in clinical trials and are attempting to bring bench discoveries to the bedside to benefit patients. These novel therapies include improved chemotherapeutic agents, targeted molecular inhibitors, cell cycle regulators, pro-apoptotic agents, epigenetic modifiers, and metabolic therapies. Immunotherapies in the form of vaccines; naked, conjugated and bispecific monoclonal antibodies; cell-based therapy; and immune checkpoint inhibitors are also being evaluated in an effort to replicate the success seen in other malignancies.

Such work can be accelerated and made more efficient by methodologies enabling the characterization of leukemia samples in multiplex assays. We recently developed three sets of lentiviral fluorescent genetic barcoding (FGB) vectors that create 26, 14, and 6 unique immunophenotyping-compatible color codes from GFP-, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-, and monomeric kusabira orange 2 (mKO2)-derived fluorescent proteins. These vectors allow for labeling and tracking of individual color-coded cell populations in mixed samples by real-time flow cytometry. Using the prototypical Hoxa9/Meis1 murine model of acute myeloid leukemia, we describe the application of the 6xFGB vector system for assessing leukemic cell characteristics in multiplex assays. By transplanting color-coded cell mixes, we investigated the competitive growth behavior of individual color-coded populations, determined leukemia-initiating cell frequencies, and assessed the dose-dependent potential of cells exposed to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Entinostat for bone marrow homing. Thus, FGB provides a useful tool for the multiplex characterization of leukemia samples in a wide variety of applications with a concomitant reduction in workload, processing times, and mouse utilization.",,['NOTNLM'],"['H9M', 'Hoxa9', 'LSC', 'Meis1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'fluorescent genetic barcoding', 'lentiviral gene transfer', 'leukemic stem cell']",,,PMC5480982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exercise-induced myokines influence crosstalk between different organs in an autocrine, endocrine, or paracrine fashion. Myokines are recently recognized as potential candidates for treating metabolic diseases through their ability to stimulate AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, increase glucose uptake, and improve lipolysis. Myokines may have positive effects on metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, or obesity. Numerous studies on myokines suggested that myokines offer a potential treatment option for preventing metabolic diseases.

Normalization and encoding method is applied for spectral feature extraction and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm is presented for spatial feature determination. A marker-based learning vector quantization (MLVQ) neural network is proposed to perform identification with the integrated features. Experimental results show that this algorithm yields identification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92.9%, 93.3%, and 92.5%, respectively.

These methods can be inaccurate for quantifying M-proteins at low concentrations. We compared the consistency and clinical impact of response assignment by electrophoretic and heavy+light chain (HLC) immunoassays post-consolidation in 463 newly diagnosed patients. The two methods gave similar assignments in patients with partial (PR; 79% agreement) or complete response (CR; 92%). However, in patients achieving very good PR (VGPR) there was poor concordance between methods (45%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) for standard VGPR patients was 34.5 months; HLC responses stratified these patients further into PR, VGPR and CR, with median PFS of 21.3, 28.9 months and not reached, respectively; P<0.001. At this time, abnormal HLC ratios had better concordance with multiparametric flow cytometry (sensitivity 10(-4)) (37 and 34% positive, respectively), compared to immunofixation (62% positive). In addition, HLC-pair suppression was identified in 38% of patients and associated with shorter PFS (30.6 months vs not reached; P<0.001).

However, a successful antibody-based targeting approach critically relies on the availability of a tumor-associated target that is not only preferentially expressed in the tumor tissue but is also easily accessible for antibody therapeutics coming from the bloodstream. Here, we perfused the vasculature of healthy and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-bearing rats with a reactive ester derivative of biotin and subsequently quantified the biotinylated proteins to identify AML-associated bone marrow (BM) antigens accessible from the bloodstream. In total, >1400 proteins were identified. Overall, 181 proteins were >100-fold overexpressed in AML as compared with normal BM. Eleven of the most differentially expressed proteins were further validated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopic analyses, including novel antigens highly expressed in AML cells (for example, adaptor-related protein complex 3 beta2) and in the leukemia-modified extracellular matrix (ECM) (for example, collagen-VI-alpha-1). The presented atlas of targetable AML-associated BM proteins provides a valuable basis for the development of monoclonal antibodies that could be used as carriers for a site-specific pharmacodelivery of cytotoxic drugs, cytokines or radionuclides to the BM in AML.",,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL-rearranged leukemias are associated with extremely poor prognosis, and response to conventional therapies and efforts to identify molecular targets are urgently needed. Using mouse models of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia, here we show that genetic inactivation or small-molecule inhibition of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 exhibit anti-tumoral activity in MLL-fusion protein-driven transformation. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis revealed that inhibition of PRMT5 methyltransferase activity overrides the differentiation block in leukemia cells without affecting the expression of MLL-fusion direct oncogenic targets. Furthermore, we find that this differentiation block is mediated by transcriptional silencing of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1a) gene in leukemia cells.

Copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity at 3p21.3 (where SETD2 maps) was subsequently found in SM patients and prompted us to undertake an in-depth analysis of SETD2 copy number, mutation status, transcript expression and methylation levels, as well as functional studies in the HMC-1 cell line and in a validation cohort of 57 additional cases with SM, including MCL, aggressive SM and indolent SM. Reduced or no SETD2 protein expression-and consequently, H3K36 trimethylation-was found in all cases and inversely correlated with disease aggressiveness. Proteasome inhibition rescued SETD2 expression and H3K36 trimethylation and resulted in marked accumulation of ubiquitinated SETD2 in SETD2-deficient patients but not in patients with near-normal SETD2 expression. Bortezomib and, to a lesser extent, AZD1775 alone or in combination with midostaurin induced apoptosis and reduced clonogenic growth of HMC-1 cells and of neoplastic mast cells from advanced SM patients.

Heterozygous, inactivating ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) mutations and neomorphic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are recurrent and mutually exclusive in acute myeloid leukaemia genomes. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to stimulate the catalytic activity of TET2 in vitro and thus we sought to explore its effect in a leukaemic model expressing IDH1(R132H). Vitamin C treatment induced an IDH1(R132H)-dependent reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in expression of genes involved in leukocyte differentiation. Vitamin C induced differentially methylated regions that displayed a significant overlap with enhancers implicated in myeloid differentiation and were enriched in sequence elements for the haematopoietic transcription factors CEBPbeta, HIF1alpha, RUNX1 and PU.1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of PU.1 and RUNX1 revealed a significant loss of PU.1 and increase of RUNX1-bound DNA elements accompanied by their demethylation following vitamin C treatment.

Deregulation of C/EBPalpha by microRNAs during granulopoiesis or acute myeloid leukemia development has not been studied. Here we show that oncogenic miR-182 is a strong regulator of C/EBPalpha. Moreover, we identify a regulatory loop between C/EBPalpha and miR-182. While C/EBPalpha blocks miR-182 expression by direct promoter binding during myeloid differentiation, enforced expression of miR-182 reduces C/EBPalpha protein level and impairs granulopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, miR-182 expression is highly elevated particularly in acute myeloid leukemia patients with C-terminal CEBPA mutations, thereby depicting a mechanism by which C/EBPalpha blocks miR-182 expression. Furthermore, we present miR-182 expression as a prognostic marker in cytogenetically high-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients. Our data demonstrate the importance of a controlled balance between C/EBPalpha and miR-182 for the maintenance of healthy granulopoiesis.C/EBPalpha is a critical transcription factor involved in myelopoiesis and its inactivation is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"OBJECTIVES: Current UK health policy promotes enabling people to die in a place they choose, which for most is home. Despite this, patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma) are more likely to die in hospital than those with other cancers, and this is often considered a reflection of poor quality end-of-life care. This study aimed to explore the experiences of clinicians and relatives to determine why hospital deaths predominate in these diseases. METHODS: The study was set within the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN-www.hmrn.org), an ongoing population-based cohort that provides infrastructure for evidence-based research. Qualitative interviews were conducted with clinical staff in haematology, palliative care and general practice (n=45) and relatives of deceased HMRN patients (n=10). Data were analysed for thematic content and coding and classification was inductive. Interpretation involved seeking meaning, salience and connections within the data. RESULTS: Five themes were identified relating to: the characteristics and trajectory of haematological cancers, a mismatch between the expectations and reality of home death, preference for hospital death, barriers to home/hospice death and suggested changes to practice to support non-hospital death, when preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital deaths were largely determined by the characteristics of haematological malignancies, which included uncertain trajectories, indistinct transitions and difficulties predicting prognosis and identifying if or when to withdraw treatment. Advance planning (where possible) and better communication between primary and secondary care may facilitate non-hospital death.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2018.

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND: Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult cancer and as a prognostic factor for cancer survival is unknown. METHODS: Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous cancer and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent cancer diagnosis until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of cancer for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts cancer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without pericarditis. RESULTS: Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up. The overall cancer standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic cancer. The <3-month cancer risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2-13.7). The 3- to <12-month standardized incidence ratio of cancer was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0-1.2). Three-month survival after the cancer diagnosis was 80% and 86% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.8). One-year survival was 65% and 70%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to <12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.5).

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"Macrophages are critical for the initiation and resolution of the inflammatory phase of wound repair. In diabetes, macrophages display a prolonged inflammatory phenotype in late wound healing. Mixed-lineage leukemia-1 (MLL1) has been shown to direct gene expression by regulating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-mediated inflammatory gene transcription. Thus, we hypothesized that MLL1 influences macrophage-mediated inflammation in wound repair. We used a myeloid-specific Mll1 knockout (Mll1(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+) ) to determine the function of MLL1 in wound healing. Mll1(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+) mice display delayed wound healing and decreased wound macrophage inflammatory cytokine production compared with control animals. Furthermore, wound macrophages from Mll1(f/f)Lyz2(Cre+) mice demonstrated decreased histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) (activation mark) at NF-kappaB binding sites on inflammatory gene promoters. Of note, early wound macrophages from prediabetic mice displayed similarly decreased MLL1, H3K4me3 at inflammatory gene promoters, and inflammatory cytokines compared with controls. Late wound macrophages from prediabetic mice demonstrated an increase in MLL1, H3K4me3 at inflammatory gene promoters, and inflammatory cytokines. Prediabetic macrophages treated with an MLL1 inhibitor demonstrated reduced inflammation. Finally, monocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes had increased Mll1 compared with control subjects without diabetes. These results define an important role for MLL1 in regulating macrophage-mediated inflammation in wound repair and identify a potential target for the treatment of chronic inflammation in diabetic wounds.",['(c) 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.'],,,"['R01 HL137919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL076123/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK102357/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK089503/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK020572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112897/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",PMC5566299,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8791-6980'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 27.,"Neddylation inhibitor Pevonedistat (MLN4924) is a novel anticancer drug and has demonstrated broad-spectrum anticancer activity. Nevertheless, we found that Pevonedistat had only a modest apoptotic effect in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Moreover, we noted that inhibition of neddylation by Pevonedistat led to accumulation of Mcl-1 protein in OS cells. Because Mcl-1 is an important anti-apoptotic protein and also because apoptosis has been shown to be a major cell death pathway, we hypothesized that Mcl-1 accumulation negatively impacted Pevonedistat-mediated anticancer activity in OS cells. In this regard, we employed genetic or pharmacological approaches to inhibit Mcl-1 expression and to examine the effect on Pevonedistat-induced apoptosis in OS cells. We found that inhibition of Mcl-1 expression by siRNA considerably enhanced Pevonedistat-triggered the activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage and apoptosis, and also dramatically promoted the ability of Pevonedistat to inhibit colony formation of OS cells. Moreover, we observed that flavopiridol, a FDA approved drug, inhibited Mcl-1 expression and substantially enhanced Pevonedistat-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and significantly augmented cell killing effect in OS cells. Altogether, our study shows that Mcl-1 is a critical resistance factor to Pevonedistat monotherapy, and suggests that Pevonedistat in combinations with flavopiridol may achieve better anticancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We assumed that the basicity of the amine nitrogen, which formed an ionic bond with Asp348 of HCK, markedly affected inhibitory activity against HCK. The pKa values of the nitrogen were predicted by means of an ab initio quantum mechanical method, and complexes of the derivatives with HCK were analyzed by X-ray crystallography.

Here, we investigated microRNA (miRNA)-based regulation of thrombin-driven microglial activation using an in vitro thrombin toxicity model applied to primary human microglia. METHODS: A miRNA array identified 22 differential miRNA candidates. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) identified miR-181c as the most significantly downregulated miRNA. TargetScan analysis identified mixed lineage leukemia-1 (MLL1) as a putative gene target for miR-181c. qRT-PCR was applied to assess tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), miR-181c, and MLL1 levels following thrombin or proteinase-activated receptor-4-specific activating peptide (PAR4AP) exposure. Anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) silencing were employed to test TNF-alpha/TNFR dependence. A dual-luciferase reporter system and miR-181c mimic transfection assessed whether mir-181c directly binds to and negatively regulates MLL1. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB)-dependent luciferase reporter assays and NF-kappaB target gene expression were assessed in wild-type (MLL1+) and MLL1-silenced cells. RESULTS: Thrombin or PAR4AP-induced miR-181c downregulation (p < 0.05) and MLL1 upregulation (p < 0.05) that were dependent upon TNF-alpha/TNFR. miR-181c decreased wild-type MLL1 3'-UTR luciferase reporter activity (p < 0.05), and a miR-181c mimic suppressed MLL1 expression (p < 0.05). Thrombin treatment increased, while miR-181c reduced, NF-kappaB activity and NF-kappaB target gene expression in both wild-type (MLL1+) and MLL1-silenced cells (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thrombin-induced, TNF-alpha/TNFR-dependent miR-181c downregulation promotes MLL1 expression, increases NF-kappaB activity, and upregulates NF-kappaB target gene expression. As miR-181c opposes thrombin's stimulation of pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB activity, miR-181c mimic therapy may show promise in controlling thrombin-driven microglial activation following ICH.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ICH', '*Intracerebral hemorrhage', '*MicroRNA', '*Microglia', '*Thrombin']",,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",PMC5492717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until now, its role as an RNA helicase and as a regulator of retrotransposons has been characterized exclusively in cell lines. We investigated the role of Mov10 in the mouse brain by examining its expression over development and attempting to create a Mov10 knockout mouse. Loss of both Mov10 copies led to early embryonic lethality. RESULTS: Mov10 was significantly elevated in postnatal murine brain, where it bound retroelement RNAs and mRNAs. Mov10 suppressed retroelements in the nucleus by directly inhibiting complementary DNA synthesis, while cytosolic Mov10 regulated cytoskeletal mRNAs to influence neurite outgrowth. We verified this important function by observing reduced dendritic arborization in hippocampal neurons from the Mov10 heterozygote mouse and shortened neurites in the Mov10 knockout Neuro2A cells. Knockdown of Fmrp also resulted in shortened neurites. Mov10, Fmrp, and Ago2 bound a common set of mRNAs in the brain. Reduced Mov10 in murine brain resulted in anxiety and increased activity in a novel environment, supporting its important role in the development of normal brain circuitry. CONCLUSIONS: Mov10 is essential for normal neuronal development and brain function. Mov10 preferentially binds RNAs involved in actin binding, neuronal projection, and cytoskeleton. This is a completely new and critically important function for Mov10 in neuronal development and establishes a precedent for Mov10 being an important candidate in neurological disorders that have underlying cytoarchitectural causes like autism and Alzheimer's disease.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Brain', '*Embryonic development', '*L1', '*Mov10', '*Neurite outgrowth', '*Neurogenesis', '*RISC', '*RNA helicase', '*Retrotransposons']","['R01 HL126845/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM070421/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Mov10l1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",PMC5492891,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8100-5115'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subgroup J avian leukosis viruses (ALV-J), which induce erythroblastosis and myelocytomatosis, have the greatest pathogenicity and transmission ability within this class of viruses. ALV can be transmitted both horizontally and vertically; however, the effects of ALV infection in chickens-especially roosters-during the propagation, on future generations is not clear. Knowing the role of the cock in the transmission of ALV from generation to generation might contribute to the eradication programs for ALV. RESULTS: The results showed that two hens inseminated with ALV-J-positive semen developed temporary antibody responses to ALV-J at 4-5 weeks post insemination. The p27 antigen was detected in cloacal swabs of six hens, and in 3 of 26 egg albumens at 1-6 weeks after insemination. Moreover, no viremia was detected at 6 weeks after insemination even when virus isolation had been conducted six times at weekly intervals for each of the 12 females. However, ALV-J was isolated from 1 of their 34 progeny chicks at 1 week of age, and its gp85 had 98.4%-99.2% sequence identity with the gp85 of ALV-J isolated from semen samples of the six cocks.

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND: RUNX1 haplodeficiency is associated with thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction and a predisposition to acute leukaemia. Platelets possess three distinct types of granules and secretory processes involving dense granules (DG), alpha-granules and vesicles or lysosomes containing acid hydrolases (AH). Dense granules and granule deficiencies have been reported in patients with RUNX1 mutations. Little is known regarding the secretion from AH-containing vesicles. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied two related patients with a RUNX1 mutation, easy bruising, and mild thrombocytopenia. Platelet aggregation and (14) C serotonin in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were impaired in response to ADP, epinephrine, collagen and arachidonic acid. Contents of DG (ATP, ADP), alpha-granules (beta-thromboglobulin) and AH-containing vesicles (beta-glucuronidase, beta-hexosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase) were normal or minimally decreased. Dense granules secretion on stimulation of gel-filtered platelets with thrombin and divalent ionophore A23187 (4-12 mumol L(-1) ) were diminished. beta-thromboglobulin and AH secretion was impaired in response to thrombin or A23187. We studied thromboxane-related pathways. The incorporation of (14) C -arachidonic acid into phospholipids and subsequent arachidonic acid release on thrombin activation was normal. Platelet thromboxane A2 production in whole blood serum and on thrombin stimulation of PRP was normal, suggesting that the defective secretion was not due to impaired thromboxane production. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide the first evidence in patients with a RUNX1 mutation for a defect in AH (lysosomal) secretion, and for a global defect in secretion involving all three types of platelet granules that is unrelated to a granule content deficiency.

The interaction between USP14 and Aurora B were determined by Western blot. The effect of USP14 in the regulation of Aurora B was detected by cycloheximide (CHX) and deubiquitination assays. FACS assay was used to determine the apoptosis ratio of cells after treatments. RESULTS: We found that Aurora B was ubiquitinated and degraded during leukemic chemotherapy drugs-induced cell apoptosis. FBXW7 mediated Aurora B ubiquitination and degradation during chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis. USP14 associated with Aurora B and prevented Aurora B degradation. Functionally, overexpression of USP14 inhibits chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. On the contrary, administration of b-AP15, a specific inhibitor of USP14, significantly increased leukemia cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Thus, our data suggest that USP14 plays a novel critical role of in leukemia cells apoptosis through Aurora B stabilization and USP14 could be a potential therapeutic target for leukemia.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s).

The complexes were screened for their anticancer potential in vitro on ten human cancer cell lines, concretely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), osteosarcoma (HOS), lung carcinoma (A549), cervix epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa), malignant melanoma (G-361), prostate carcinoma (22Rv1, PC-3), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), ovarian carcinoma (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma (A2780R). The complexes exhibited significant wide-spectrum anticancer activity in vitro against all the employed cell lines, with IC50 approximately 0.5-24.0muM. Very good correlation between the lipophilicity parameter log P and IC50 values of anticancer activity in vitro were obtained by simple QSAR analysis. The most lipophilic complexes 2, 4 and 5 showed the best results, as they reached the sub-micromolar IC50 values against the A2780 and A2780R sub-lines, with the best result equal 0.5+/-0.1muM on A2780 for complex 5. The in vivo testing of the representative complexes 1, 4 and 5 (applied at the same dose of Pt as 2mg/kg dose of cisplatin) on a L1210 leukaemia model revealed their positive effect on the prolongation of the mean survival time, even if it was lower than that of cisplatin. The (1)H NMR interaction study revealed the ability of complexes to interact with glutathione (GSH) and 5'-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and overall higher stability of the complexes 1-5 as compared to cisplatin. The electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry experiments with complex 1 identified the formation of a rich collection of hydrolytic species in water-containing media after 24h and the interaction intermediates with sulfur-containing biomolecule l-cysteine, but not with the reduced glutathione at physiologically relevant concentration levels.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we perform a pairwise comparison of 90,000 putative binding pockets detected in 3,700 proteins, and find that 23,000 pairs of proteins have at least one similar cavity that could, in principle, accommodate similar ligands. By inspecting these pairs, we demonstrate how the detection of similar binding sites expands the space of opportunities for the rational design of drug polypharmacology.

This elegant, straightforward and green approach avoids the use of solvents, high temperatures and the necessity to phase transfer the nanocrystals prior to application. Non-toxic CuInS2, (CuInZn)S2, and CuInS2/ZnS core/shell quantum confined nanocrystals are synthesized via a biomineralization process based on a single recombinant cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) enzyme. First, soluble In-S complexes are formed from indium acetate and H2S generated by CSE, which are then stabilized by l-cysteine in solution. The subsequent addition of copper, or both copper and zinc, precursors then results in the immediate formation of CuInS2 or (CuInZn)S2 quantum dots. Shell growth is realized through subsequent introduction of Zn acetate to the preformed core nanocrystals. The size and optical properties of the nanocrystals are tuned by adjusting the indium precursor concentration and initial incubation period. CuInS2/ZnS core/shell particles are conjugated to IgG antibodies using EDC/NHS cross-linkers and then applied in the bioimaging of THP-1 cells. Cytotoxicity tests confirm that CuInS2/ZnS core/shell quantum dots do not cause cell death during bioimaging. Thus, this biomineralization enabled approach provides a facile, low temperature route for the fully aqueous synthesis of non-toxic CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots, which are ideal for use in bioimaging applications.",,,,,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '045A6V3VFX (Indium)', 'KPS085631O (zinc sulfide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After intravenous application and systemic distribution of the drug in the patient's body, the tumor site is exposed to light. Subsequently, toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated, inducing tumor cell death. To prevent unwanted activation of the drug in other regions of the body, patients have to avoid light during and after the treatment cycles, consequently impairing quality of life. Here, we characterize toxicity and hypericin-mediated effects on cancer cells in vitro and confirm that its effect clearly depends on concentration and illumination time. To reduce side effects and to increase therapy success, selective accumulation of hypericin in the tumor region is a promising solution. Loading hypericin on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and guiding them to the desired place using an external magnetic field might accomplish this task (referred to as Magnetic Drug Targeting (MDT)).

These abnormalities are common in myeloid neoplasms and are associated with a poor prognosis. Chromosomal abnormalities within the involved range of bands may contribute to the ectopic expression or formation of fusion genes involving the EVI1 gene, but the exact mechanism by which EVI1 affects leukemogenesis remains unclear. Herein, we report an analysis of 60 patient cases presenting various myeloid malignancies with t(2;3)(p13-25;q25-29) compiled from the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer. In these studies, this translocation has been reported as a sole abnormality or within the context of a complex karyotype. Among the analysis in which molecular cytogenetic analysis was performed in order to assess the involvement of the EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 proton homolog) locus (n=19), 16 (84%) confirmed its rearrangement. In 37% of studies, the t(2;3) was seen as a sole abnormality (n=22). The t(2;3) was secondary in 11% of cases (n=4), and in 63% of the cases the t(2;3) had additional chromosomal abnormalities (n=38). Monosomy 7, deletion of the 5q arm, and translocations involving (9;22) were most common abnormalities in order of prevalence, occurring in 29% (n=11), 26% (n=10), and 13% (n=5) of case studies, respectively. These observations in the results of the literature on t(2;3), an anomaly not otherwise molecularly characterized, adds to the discussion of this translocation's approximate incidence in myeloid disease, and specifically in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Epub 2017 Jul 10.,"INTRODUCTION: The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a central hub in the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway and strongly influences B cell maturation, differentiation and proliferation. Not surprisingly, BTK plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of various B cell lymphomas. Inhibitors of BTK have broadened our therapeutic options in several B cell lymphomas and already are an integral element in the treatment of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Waldenstrom's marcoglobulinemia. Several second generation BTK inhibitors are in clinical development and might further improve tolerability and efficacy of therapy in advanced stage CLL and MCL. Areas covered: This review illustrates the mechanism of action of BTK inhibitors and provides a comprehensive summary of key clinical trials in the development of BTK inhibitors. Characteristics of second generation BTK-inhibitors are described. Expert opinion: With accumulation of clinical experience after drug approval, longer patient follow-up and larger numbers of treated patients, future development will focus on the identification of intelligent treatment combinations. Individual selection of patients with distinct biologically properties might guide treatment decisions. While BTK inhibitors are moving to earlier treatment lines, the incorporation of these drugs into a comprehensive therapeutic strategy is still difficult to date.",,['NOTNLM'],"[""Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)', 'ibrutinib', 'mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND: As pegylated asparaginase is becoming the preferred first-line asparaginase preparation in the chemotherapy regimens of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), there is a need to evaluate this treatment. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of prolonged upfront biweekly PEG-asparaginase (where PEG is polyethylene glycol) treatment by measuring serum l-asparaginase activity and formation of anti-PEG-asparaginase antibodies. A total of 97 evaluable patients (1-17 years), diagnosed with ALL, and treated according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol (where NOPHO is Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology) were included. In the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, patients are randomized to 8 or 15 doses of intramuscular PEG-asparaginase (Oncaspar((R)) ) 1,000 IU/m(2)/dose, at 2-week or 6-week intervals with a total of 30-week treatment (Clinical trials.gov. no.: NCT00819351). RESULTS: The pharmacological target of treatment (l-asparaginase activity above 100 IU/l) was reached in 612 of 652 (94%) samples obtained 14 +/- 2 days after PEG-asparaginase administration. Mean l-asparaginase activity was 338 IU/l. Six patients had l-asparaginase activity below 50 IU/l in all samples. A total of 25 patients (26%) developed Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-PEG-asparaginase antibodies, but there was no correlation between anti-PEG-asparaginase antibodies and low levels of asparaginase activity. CONCLUSION: We conclude that prolonged first-line biweekly PEG-asparaginase therapy, 1,000 IU/m(2)/dose was above the pharmacological target in the vast majority of patients. Presence of anti-PEG-asparaginase antibodies was not a predictor of l-asparaginase activity.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'antibodies', 'asparaginase', 'leukemia', 'pediatric hematology/oncology', 'pharmacokinetics']",,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2695-8391'],"['Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, NOPHO Group']",,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00819351'],,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is a rare but serious complication of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. No available consensus exists regarding its risk factors and appropriate management due to the rarity of cases. PROCEDURES: Out of 209 ALL patients aged 1-21 years treated at the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon between May 2002 and May 2015, 13 developed CSVT during therapy. Patient characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes were studied. RESULTS: The incidence of CSVT was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4-10.4). Using univariate analysis, increased risk of CSVT was observed with age >10 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.13-11.2), T-cell immunophenotype (OR: 4.14, 95% CI: 1.16-14.7), and intermediate/high risk disease (OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.03-11.7). The only statistically significant risk factor by multivariate analysis was the treatment as per the intermediate-/high-risk protocol (HR: 15.6, 95% CI: 1.43-171.3). Most cases (77%) occurred in the postinduction phases of treatment while receiving a combination of asparaginase and dexamethasone rather than prednisone. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for a minimum of 3 months and until significant radiological improvement is observed resulted in 100% survival rate. All but one patient had complete neurological recovery. CONCLUSIONS: CSVT is an important complication of childhood ALL therapy. Postinduction combined asparaginase and dexamethasone intensive treatment for intermediate-/high-risk patients was the most important risk factor. Treatment with LMWH for a minimum of 3 months, and until asparginase therapy is over, with major radiological improvement seems to be effective and feasible.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['asparaginase', 'cerebral sinus venous thrombosis', 'childhood ALL', 'steroids']",,"['0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3601-2244'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and twenty patients who underwent AHSCT for AML were included in this retrospective single center analysis. The procedure was performed over a 19 years period and transplanted patients were in first complete remission (CR1; n = 109) or in second CR (CR2; n = 11). The median age at transplant was 37 years (range 18-64). The source of stem cells was bone marrow (n = 61; 50.8%), peripheral blood (n = 36; 30%) and bone marrow with peripheral blood (n = 23; 19.2%). The median time from AML diagnosis to AHSCT was 0.8 year (range 0.3-4.4) and the median follow-up after AHSCT for surviving patients was 12.8 years (range 3.1-20.5). The median LFS was 1.1 year. The probability of LFS calculated at 5 years and 10 years after transplantation was 28% (95%CI, 22%-32%) and 21% (95%CI, 18%-24%), respectively. The last relapse occurred 14.8 years after AHSCT and among patients who survived >2 years, 28.4% (27/95) had leukemia recurrence. The median OS was 1.7 years. The probability of OS after 5 years and 10 years was 29% and 22%, respectively. There was a tendency for increased LFS for patients younger than 50 years at transplant if compared to older population. AHSCT for AML was safe with acceptable toxicity profile.

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis (XO) is an exceedingly rare disease characterized by infiltration of histiocytes and foamy macrophages. Both on gross examination and on radiographs, XO can mimic malignancy. We describe the case of a 5-year-old female with Alagille syndrome who presented with a pathologic fracture of the right humerus. Initial radiographs revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in the distal humerus while MRI showed a large soft tissue mass. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of XO, which has hitherto not been described in a patient with Alagille syndrome. The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics and taken to the operating room for an incision and debridement. Tissue cultures were obtained and grew Salmonella. Antibiotic therapy was tapered, and the patient responded to treatment. She was doing well at her 6-month follow-up visit. In the discussion section, we explore how osteopenia and immune dysregulation caused by Alagille syndrome can affect the development of XO. We summarize all previously reported cases of XO and conclude that XO presents as an osteolytic lesion that expands rapidly over the course of a few weeks. We highlight that XO can mimic sarcoma because of its mass effect but can be distinguished radiographically by the presence of surrounding sclerosis. Given the rapid onset of XO, we classify it as an acute osteomyelitis. We discuss how leukemia and Ewing sarcoma can present similarly to acute osteomyelitis. We then emphasize key features that can be used to distinguish these malignancies from acute osteomyelitis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Alagille syndrome', 'Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, mainly levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy for these patients. There is limited data regarding the utilization of other quinolone antibiotics including moxifloxacin in this setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed comparing the use of prophylactic moxifloxacin to that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin during periods of prolonged neutropenia. Adult patients admitted to a community teaching hospital while receiving induction or reinduction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia were included. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one patients were included in this study. The two groups displayed slight heterogeneity: patients receiving moxifloxacin were approximately 10 years younger (54 vs. 64 years, p = 0.01), more likely to receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) (45 vs. 19%, p = 0.001), and neutropenic for a longer duration (23 vs. 19 days, p = 0.009). The incidence of febrile neutropenia (76 vs. 81%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78-1.11, p = 0.42) and of documented infections (27 vs. 33%, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.49-1.36, p = 0.44) was similar between those receiving moxifloxacin and levofloxacin/ciprofloxacin, respectively.

Azelaic acid (AZA) is non-toxic, non-teratogenic, and non-mutagenic and its antitumor effect on various tumor cells is well established; Nonetheless, its therapeutic effects in AML cells are largely unknown. In this study, it was shown that AZA significantly inhibits the cell viability and induces apoptosis in AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, AZA suppressed the expression of phosphorylated Akt, Jab1 and Trx, and this suppression was enhanced by treatment with Jab1 siRNA. Furthermore, AZA sensitized AML cells to Ara-c chemotherapy. The suppressive effect of AZA on tumor growth was examined in vivo by subcutaneously inoculated AML cells in a tumor model using nude mice.

The AP-1 factor basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like 3 (BATF3), is highly transcribed in cHL and ALCL; however, its functional importance in lymphomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that proto-typical CD30(+) lymphomas, namely cHL (21/30) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (8/9), but also CD30(+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (15/20) frequently express BATF3 protein. Mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation established interactions of BATF3 with JUN and JUNB in cHL and ALCL lines. BATF3 knockdown using short hairpin RNAs was toxic for cHL and ALCL lines, reducing their proliferation and survival. We identified MYC as a critical BATF3 target and confirmed binding of BATF3 to the MYC promoter. JAK/STAT signaling regulated BATF3 expression, as chemical JAK2 inhibition reduced and interleukin 13 stimulation induced BATF3 expression in cHL lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation substantiated a direct regulation of BATF3 by STAT proteins in cHL and ALCL lines. In conclusion, we identified STAT-mediated BATF3 expression that is essential for lymphoma cell survival and promoted MYC activity in cHL and ALCL, hence we recognized a new oncogenic axis in these lymphomas.",,,,,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1194-6614'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which stroma in the microenvironment regulates leukemia survival remain largely unknown. Using reverse-phase protein array technology, we profiled 53 key protein molecules in 11 signaling pathways in 20 primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and two cell lines, aiming to understand stroma-mediated signaling modulation in response to the targeted agents temsirolimus (MTOR), ABT737 (BCL2/BCL-XL), and Nutlin-3a (MDM2), and to identify the effective combination therapy targeting acute myeloid leukemia in the context of the leukemia microenvironment. Stroma reprogrammed signaling networks and modified the sensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia samples to all three targeted inhibitors. Stroma activated AKT at Ser473 in the majority of samples treated with single-agent ABT737 or Nutlin-3a. This survival mechanism was partially abrogated by concomitant treatment with temsirolimus plus ABT737 or Nutlin-3a. Mapping the signaling networks revealed that combinations of two inhibitors increased the number of affected proteins in the targeted pathways and in multiple parallel signaling, translating into facilitated cell death. These results demonstrated that a mechanism-based selection of combined inhibitors can be used to guide clinical drug selection and tailor treatment regimens to eliminate microenvironment-mediated resistance in acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,"['R01 CA163481/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC5685227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who develop hematologic malignancies are typically young, respond poorly to conventional therapy, and need allogeneic stem cell transplant from non-familial donors. Understanding the spectrum of bone marrow morphologic and genetic findings in these patients is critical to ensure diagnostic accuracy and develop criteria to recognize the onset of hematologic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome. However, bone marrow features remain poorly characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the clinicopathologic and genetic findings of 11 patients from 7 pedigrees. Of these, 6 patients did not develop hematologic malignancies over a 22-month follow-up period; 5 patients developed hematologic malignancies (3 acute myeloid leukemia; 2 myelodysplastic syndrome). All patients had thrombocytopenia at initial presentation. All 6 patients who did not develop hematologic malignancies showed baseline bone marrow abnormalities: low-for-age cellularity (n=4), dysmegakaryopoiesis (n=5), megakaryocytic hypoplasia/hyperplasia (n=5), and eosinophilia (n=4). Two patients had multiple immunophenotypic alterations in CD34-positive myeloblasts; 1 patient had clonal hematopoiesis.

Print 2017 Sep.,"Bovine leukemia is classified into two types: enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and sporadic bovine leukosis (SBL). EBL is caused by infection with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which induces persistent lymphocytosis and B-cell lymphoma in cattle after a long latent period. Although it has been demonstrated that BLV-associated lymphoma occurs predominantly in adult cattle of >3 to 5 years, suspicious cases of EBL onset in juvenile cattle were recently reported in Japan. To investigate the current status of bovine leukemia in Japan, we performed immunophenotypic analysis of samples from 50 cattle that were clinically diagnosed as having bovine leukemia. We classified the samples into five groups on the basis of the analysis and found two different types of EBL: classic EBL (cEBL), which has the familiar phenotype commonly known as EBL, and polyclonal EBL (pEBL), which exhibited neoplastic proliferation of polyclonal B cells. Moreover, there were several atypical EBL cases even in cEBL, including an early onset of EBL in juvenile cattle. A comparison of the cell marker expressions among cEBL, pEBL, and B-cell-type SBL (B-SBL) revealed characteristic patterns in B-cell leukemia, and these patterns could be clearly differentiated from those of healthy phenotypes, whereas it was difficult to discriminate between cEBL, pEBL, and B-SBL only by the expression patterns of cell markers. This study identified novel characteristics of bovine leukemia that should contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying tumor development in BLV infection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukemia', 'early onset EBL', 'expression patterns of B-cell markers', 'immunophenotyping']",,['0 (Biomarkers)'],PMC5585698,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Vaccine Immunol. ;24(12 ):.

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Background: Dietary fat intake may contribute to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) pathogenesis by influencing carcinogen exposure or through immune modulation.Objective: We aimed to evaluate NHL risk associated with total and specific dietary fat intake.Design: We evaluated associations within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) (n = 88,598) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (n = 47,531) using repeated validated dietary assessments. We confirmed 1802 incident NHL diagnoses through 2010. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for all NHL and common subtypes associated with a 1-SD increase in cumulative mean intakes of total, animal, saturated, trans, and vegetable fats and marine fatty acids. We pooled sex-specific HRs using random-effects meta-analysis.Results: Over 24-30 y of follow-up, neither total nor specific dietary fats were significantly associated with NHL risk overall. Higher total, animal, and saturated fat intakes were positively associated with the risk of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma subtype among women only (253 cases; P-trend </= 0.05), driven by strong associations during 1980-1994. From baseline through 1994, among women and men combined, total fat intake was borderline-significantly positively associated with NHL overall (pooled HR per SD: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.29) and was significantly associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (pooled HR per SD: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.05), with similar trends for animal and saturated fat intake. For women only, trans fat was significantly positively associated with all NHL. In contrast, during 1994-2010, there was little evidence for associations of dietary fat intake with NHL overall or by subtype.Conclusion: Previous observations of an increased risk of NHL associated with intakes of total, animal, saturated, and trans fat with 14 y of follow-up did not persist with longer follow-up.",['(c) 2017 American Society for Nutrition.'],['NOTNLM'],"['diet', 'epidemiology', 'fat', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'nutrition']","['R01 CA098122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA087969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA167552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Trans Fatty Acids)']",PMC5525121,,,,,"['Am J Clin Nutr. 2018 Feb 1;107(2):293-294.

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"Prolonged exposure to thiopurines (eg, mercaptopurine [MP]) is essential for curative therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but is also associated with frequent dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicities, which is partly explained by inherited genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes (eg, TPMT). Recently, our group and others identified germ line genetic variants in NUDT15 as another major cause of thiopurine-related myelosuppression, particularly in Asian and Hispanic people. In this article, we describe 3 novel NUDT15 coding variants (p.R34T, p.K35E, and p.G17_V18del) in 5 children with ALL enrolled in frontline protocols in Singapore, Taiwan, and at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Patients carrying these variants experienced significant toxicity and reduced tolerance to MP across treatment protocols. Functionally, all 3 variants led to partial to complete loss of NUDT15 nucleotide diphosphatase activity and negatively influenced protein stability. In particular, the p.G17_V18del variant protein showed extremely low thermostability and was completely void of catalytic activity, thus likely to confer a high risk of thiopurine intolerance. This in-frame deletion was only seen in African and European patients, and is the first NUDT15 risk variant identified in non-Asian, non-Hispanic populations. In conclusion, we discovered 3 novel loss-of-function variants in NUDT15 associated with MP toxicity, enabling more comprehensive pharmacogenetics-based thiopurine dose adjustments across diverse populations.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM118578/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",PMC5606007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cisplatin is the most commonly used conventional chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of ESCC, but some patients have a poor response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. New strategies that could enhance chemosensitivity to cisplatin are needed. METHODS: We used reverse transcription-RCR (RT-PCR), immunoblot, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, anchorage-dependent and -independent growth assays, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, RNA interference and in vivo tumor growth assay to study the expression of MCL-1 in ESCCs and the response of ESCC cells to cisplatin. RESULTS: The present study showed that MCL-1 expression was significantly increased in ESCC tissues compared to normal adjacent tissues and was associated with depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of MCL-1 produced significant chemosensitization to cisplatin in association with caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in KYSE150 and KYSE510 cells. The selective MCL-1 inhibitor UMI-77 caused dissociation of MCL-1 from the proapoptotic protein BAX and BAK, and enhanced KYSE150 and KYSE510 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis accompanied by caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that MCL-1 contributes to the development of ESCC and is a promising therapeutic target for chemosensitization of ESCC cells to cisplatin. This might provide a scientific basis for developing effective approaches to treat the subset of ESCCs patients with MCL-1 overexpression.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apopotosis', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cisplatin', 'Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma', 'MCL-1']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",PMC5490225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a potent and selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-delta (PI3K-delta) inhibitor. PI3K-delta primarily is expressed in B-cells and prevents effectively proliferation in malignant B-cells. METHODS: We provide a detailed report on treatment history and photo documentation of acute adverse effects of radiation therapy with simultaneous Idelalisib medication in one case of B-CLL. Radiosensitivity tests were performed for the index patient under Idelalisib and after the addition of Idelalisib to healthy individuals' blood. Radiosensitivity in human lymphocytes was analyzed with a three color in situ hybridization assay. Primary skin fibroblasts were studied after a treatment with Idelalisib for apoptosis, necrosis and cell cycle using flow cytometry. DNA double-strand break repair was analyzed by gammaH2AX immunostaining. RESULTS: The index patient presented a strong grade 2 radiodermatitis and grade 3 mucositis after irradiation with 20 Gy and a simultaneous intake of Idelalisib. Irradiations without Idelalisib medication were well tolerated and resulted in not more than grade 1 radiodermatitis. The index patient under Idelalisib had a radiosensitivity of 0.62 B/M which is in the range of clearly radiosensitive patients. A combined treatment of lymphocytes with 2 Gy and 10 nmol/l Idelalisib showed a tendency to an increased radiosensitivity. We found a clear increase of apoptosis as a result of the combined treatment in the Idelalisib dose range of 1 to 100 nmol/l compared to solely irradiated cells or solely Idelalisib treated cells (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: A combined Idelalisib radiotherapy treatment has an increased risk of side effects. However, combined therapy seems to be feasible when patients are monitored closely.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Idelalisib', 'Kinase inhibitor', 'Radiotherapy', 'Side effects']",,"['0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",PMC5490234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 24.,"AIMS To estimate the prevalence of cats testing positive for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens in domestic cats entering a New Zealand animal shelter, based on a commercial point-of-care ELISA, to identify risk factors associated with cats testing positive, and to compare the results obtained from the ELISA with those obtained using PCR-based testing. METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed on 388 cats entering the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals animal shelter in Auckland, New Zealand between 7 February 2014 and 30 May 2014. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat and tested for FIV antibody and FeLV antigen using a commercial point-of-care ELISA. Information on the signalment and health status of the cat at the time of entry was also recorded. Blood and saliva samples from a subset of cats were tested for FIV and FeLV proviral DNA using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS Of the 388 cats in the study sample, 146 (37.6%) had been relinquished by owners, 237 (62.4%) were strays, and 5 (1.3%) were of unknown origin. Overall, 53/388 (13.7%) cats tested positive for FIV antibodies and 4/388 (1.0%) were positive for FeLV antigen. Stray cats had a higher FIV seroprevalence than relinquished cats (42/237 (17.8%) vs. 11/146 (7.5%); p=0.008). Of 53 cats that were FIV-seropositive, 51 (96%) tested positive for FIV proviral DNA using PCR testing of blood. Of these 51 cats, 28 (55%) were positive by PCR testing of saliva. Of the four cats that were FeLV antigen-positive by ELISA, two (50%) were positive for FeLV proviral DNA by PCR testing of blood. The odds of a cat being seropositive for FIV were greater for intact compared to desexed cats (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.6-7.4) and for male compared to female cats (OR=6.5; 95% CI=3.2-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The seroprevalence for FIV was 14% among cats entering an animal shelter in Auckland, whereas the prevalence of FeLV antigen-positive cats was only 1%. These findings suggest differences in the transmission dynamics of each virus in free-roaming cat populations in New Zealand. Our study also highlights the potential role of desexing cats in reducing transmission of FIV. However, further data from first-opinion veterinary practices are required to confirm that these findings may be generalised to the wider domestic cat population in New Zealand.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Feline immunodeficiency virus', 'cats', 'diagnostic tests', 'epidemiology', 'feline leukaemia virus', 'risk factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among several factors to which resistance can be attributed is failure to activate complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) due to protective complement regulatory proteins, including the soluble regulator complement factor H (CFH). We hypothesized that rituximab killing of non-responsive B-CLL cells could be augmented by a novel human monoclonal antibody against CFH. The B cells from 11 patients with B-CLL were tested ex vivo in CDC assays with combinations of CFH monoclonal antibody, rituximab, and a negative control antibody. CDC of rituximab non-responsive malignant B cells from CLL patients could in some cases be augmented by the CFH monoclonal antibody. Antibody-mediated cytotoxicity of cells was dependent upon functional complement. In one case where B-CLL cells were refractory to CDC by the combination of rituximab plus CFH monoclonal antibody, additionally neutralizing the membrane complement regulatory protein CD59 allowed CDC to occur. Inhibiting CDC regulatory proteins such as CFH holds promise for overcoming resistance to rituximab therapy in B-CLL.",,,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '80295-65-4 (Complement Factor H)']",PMC5489178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 28.,"In acute myeloid leukaemia, long-term survival is poor as most patients relapse despite achieving remission. Historically, the failure of therapy has been thought to be due to mutations that produce drug resistance, possibly arising as a consequence of the mutagenic properties of chemotherapy drugs. However, other lines of evidence have pointed to the pre-existence of drug-resistant cells. For example, deep sequencing of paired diagnosis and relapse acute myeloid leukaemia samples has provided direct evidence that relapse in some cases is generated from minor genetic subclones present at diagnosis that survive chemotherapy, suggesting that resistant cells are generated by evolutionary processes before treatment and are selected by therapy. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of therapy failure and capacity for leukaemic regeneration remain obscure, as sequence analysis alone does not provide insight into the cell types that are fated to drive relapse. Although leukaemia stem cells have been linked to relapse owing to their dormancy and self-renewal properties, and leukaemia stem cell gene expression signatures are highly predictive of therapy failure, experimental studies have been primarily correlative and a role for leukaemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia relapse has not been directly proved. Here, through combined genetic and functional analysis of purified subpopulations and xenografts from paired diagnosis/relapse samples, we identify therapy-resistant cells already present at diagnosis and two major patterns of relapse. In some cases, relapse originated from rare leukaemia stem cells with a haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell phenotype, while in other instances relapse developed from larger subclones of immunophenotypically committed leukaemia cells that retained strong stemness transcriptional signatures. The identification of distinct patterns of relapse should lead to improved methods for disease management and monitoring in acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, the shared functional and transcriptional stemness properties that underlie both cellular origins of relapse emphasize the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches that target stemness to prevent relapse.",,,,,,,,,,,"['Sci Transl Med. 2017 Jul 12;9(398):.

We thus performed a meta-analysis to reveal the correlation between Bmi-1 with clinical features and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC. METHODS: Relevant studies were searched through PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as well as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated by using STATA version 12.0. RESULTS: Fourteen studies consisting of 1323 patients were included for quantitative analysis. The results showed that Bmi-1 was significantly associated with tumor size (n = 7, OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.19-2.71, P = .005, fixed effect), poor differentiation (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.11-2.33, P = .011, fixed effect), and distant metastasis (n = 4, OR = 4.69, 95% CI = 1.52-14.41, P = .007, fixed effect). In addition, high Bmi-1 expression also predicted poor OS (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.14-2.3, P < .001). There was no significant publication bias for any of the analyses.

However, CNS leukemia is rarely associated with central hypsothyroidism. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: A 2-year-old female with AML with MLL rearrangement presented with CNS infiltration. Laboratory tests suggested the presence of central hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: 0.48 mIU/ml, normal range 0.7-6.4 mIU/ml; serum free thyroxine [FT4]: 0.62 ng/dl, normal range 0.8-2.2 ng/dl; free triiodothyronine: 1.57 pg/ml, normal range 2.7-5.6 pg/ml). Magnetic resonance imaging detected no lesions in the hypothalamus, pituitary, or thyroid. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Levothyroxine (2.5 mg/kg/day) was administered together with chemotherapy and intrathecal injection of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone into the cerebrospinal fluid. The FT4 concentration increased after levothyroxine treatment, but later decreased after relapse of CNS leukemia. The TSH concentrations remained low. After remission of CNS leukemia, the TSH and FT4 concentrations quickly recovered to their normal ranges. LESSONS: We believe that the CNS leukemia directly affected TSH and thyroid hormone secretion in our patient.",,,,,['9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)'],PMC5500067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAT5 is involved in many types of cancer, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in which this protein is found constitutively activated as a consequence of BCR-ABL expression. The neuroleptic drug pimozide was recently reported to act as an inhibitor of STAT5 phosphorylation and is capable of inducing apoptosis in CML cells in vitro. Our research group has synthesized simple derivatives of pimozide with cytotoxic activity and that are able to decrease the levels of phosphorylated STAT5. In this work we continued the search for novel STAT5 inhibitors, synthesizing compounds in which the benzoimidazolinone ring of pimozide is either maintained or modified, in order to obtain further structure-activity relationship information for this class of STAT5 inhibitors. Two compounds of the series showed potent cytotoxic activity against BCR-ABL-positive and pSTAT5-overexpressing K562 cells and were able to markedly decrease the levels of phosphorylated STAT5.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

CSPG4 is implicated in several signaling pathways believed to drive cancer progression, particularly proliferation, motility and metastatic spread. Expression may serve as a prognostic marker for survival and risk of relapse in treatment-resistant malignancies including melanoma, triple negative breast cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This tumor-associated overexpression of CSPG4 points towards a highly promising therapeutic target for antibody-guided cancer therapy. Monoclonal alphaCSPG4 antibodies have been shown to inhibit cancer progression by blocking ligand access to the CSPG4 extracellular binding sites. Moreover, CSPG4-directed antibody conjugates have been shown to be selectively internalized by CSPG4-expressing cancer cells via endocytosis. CSPG4-directed immunotherapy may be approached in several ways, including: (1) antibody-based fusion proteins for the selective delivery of a pro-apoptotic factors such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand to agonistic death receptors 4 and 5 on the cell surface; and (2) CSPG4-specific immunotoxins which bind selectively to diseased cells expressing CSPG4, are internalized by them and induce arrest of biosynthesis, closely followed by initiation of apoptotic signaling.

The innovative use of a nonspecific ligand allows a widespread ""net"" for cancer cells, without a priori knowledge of the cancer type. Using lymphoblasts spiked into blood, we simulated leukemia cases with lymphoblast concentrations ranging from 1 to 30% of total leukocytes. Lymphoblasts were isolated using monoclonal antibodies for the Human Transferring Receptor (CD71). Anti-CD71 antibodies were found to be more effective for capturing lymphoblasts than commonly used, ALL-specific antibodies for CD7 and CD10. CCRF-CEM lymphoblasts were isolated in the chip with 82-97% purity, with lower concentrations tested (7%) still showing >80% purity for cell capture. Patient-derived ALL cell lines COG-LL-332 and COG-LL-317 were isolated in the chip with 80%-97% and 57% -92% of purity, respectively, with the initial spike concentrations as low as 1%.

In the present study, lentivirusmediated RIGIknockdown was used to investigate the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptotic processes of ATRAinduced NB4 cells in vitro using an MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The roles of RIGI and the AKTFOXO3A signaling pathway were investigated using western blot analysis. The results showed that the ATRAinduced expression of RIGI was specifically and effectively knocked down at the mRNA and protein levels by lentivirus mediated RIGI short hairpin RNA. In addition, silencing of RIGI reduced the ATRAinduced inhibition of NB4 cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Further investigations indicated that with ATRAinduced expression of RIGI, levels of phosphorylated (p)AKTThr308 and pForkhead Box (FOX) O3AThr32 were decreased, the expression levels of cell cycle arrest protein p27 and the apoptotic protein, tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), directly transcribed by FOXO3A were increased. By contrast, following the knockdown of ATRAinduced expression of RIGI, the levels of pAKTThr308 and pFOXO3AThr32 were increased, and the protein expression levels of p27 and TRAIL were decreased.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytokine genes may contribute to carcinogenesis. Interleukin (IL)4 gene polymorphisms have been intensively studied with regard to their associations with cancer. However, the results of these previous studies remain inconclusive. The present study, therefore, aimed to conduct a metaanalysis of previously published studies in order to clarify the association of IL4 with cancer risk. Eligible published articles were searched in Medline, PubMed, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases up to March 2016. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to identify potential associations between IL4 genetic polymorphisms and the risk of cancer. A metaanalysis was then performed on 10,873 patients and 14,328 controls for IL4 rs2243250 polymorphism, 3,970 patients and 5,686 controls for IL4 rs2070874 polymorphism, and 1,896 patients and 2,526 controls for IL4 rs79071878 polymorphism. A significant association with cancer risk was observed for rs2243250 and rs79071878 polymorphisms. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, rs2243250 polymorphism was demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer and breast cancer, rs2070874 polymorphism was correlated with leukemia and oral carcinoma, and rs79071878 polymorphism was relevant to bladder carcinoma risk. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, IL4 rs2243250 polymorphism was demonstrated to be associated with cancer risk in both Caucasian and Asian populations, rs2070874 was associated with cancer risk in Asian populations, while rs79071878 polymorphism was associated with cancer risk in Caucasian populations. In conclusion, the present results suggested that the IL4 rs2243250 and rs79071878 polymorphisms were associated with cancer susceptibility.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of GRA in colorectal cancer cells LoVo, SW480 and SW620 and studied the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results showed that GRA had potent inhibitory effects on colorectal cancer cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition was mediated by pro-apoptosis, as evident from Annexin V-FITC staining, the reduced expression of survivin and the induced expression of cleaved PARP. Furthermore, GRA treatment resulted in marked reduction of cell migration, invasion and wound healing capability, accompanying by the downregulated MMP expression. Moreover, GRA decreased the protein levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-STAT3, p-JNK, p-p38 and p-NF-kappaB p65, of which the phosphorylation of PI3K and STAT3 decreased as early as 2 h after the GRA treatment. These results suggest that regulation of the apoptosis, invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells by GRA might be through suppressing PI3K and STAT3 signaling pathways. the present study indicated that GRA could be a potential effective therapy for patients with colorectal cancer.",,,,,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'P540XA09DR (Glycyrrhetinic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others recently reported that both murine PML (mPML) and human PML (hPML) strongly restrict the early stages of infection by HIV-1 and other lentiviruses when expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This restriction activity was found to contribute to the type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 in MEFs. Additionally, PML caused transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 promoter in MEFs. In contrast, the modulation of the early stages of HIV-1 infection of human cells by PML has been investigated by RNA interference, with unclear results. In order to conclusively determine whether PML restricts HIV-1 or not in human cells, we used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat with Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system to knock out its gene in epithelial, lymphoid, and monocytic human cell lines. Infection challenges showed that PML knockout had no effect on the permissiveness of these cells to HIV-1 infection. IFN-I treatments inhibited HIV-1 equally whether PML was expressed or not. Overexpression of individual hPML isoforms, or of mPML, in a human T cell line did not restrict HIV-1. The presence of PML was not required for the restriction of nonhuman retroviruses by TRIM5alpha (another human TRIM protein), and TRIM5alpha was inhibited by arsenic trioxide through a PML-independent mechanism. We conclude that PML is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 in human cell lines representing diverse lineages. IMPORTANCE PML is involved in innate immune mechanisms against both DNA and RNA viruses. Although the mechanism by which PML inhibits highly divergent viruses is unclear, it was recently found that it can increase the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, whether human PML inhibits HIV-1 has been debated. Here we provide unambiguous, knockout-based evidence that PML does not restrict the early postentry stages of HIV-1 infection in a variety of human cell types and does not participate in the inhibition of HIV-1 by IFN-I. Although this study does not exclude the possibility of other mechanisms by which PML may interfere with HIV-1, we nonetheless demonstrate that PML does not generally act as an HIV-1 restriction factor in human cells and that its presence is not required for IFN-I to stimulate the expression of anti-HIV-1 genes.

Most patients are either asymptomatic or present with fatigue, abdominal fullness, and splenomegaly. This is a case in which a 72-year-old Caucasian male's initial presentation of CML was new-onset atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and pneumonia. The severity of his symptoms of atrial fibrillation and dyspnea complicated his stabilization, which delayed his diagnosis of CML and initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treatment. Unregulated proliferation of leukemic cells increases blood viscosity and results in aberrations in blood circulation that may result in atypical presenting symptoms in myeloproliferative disease.

Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid, which has been known as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand. AhR is a cytoplasmic receptor, which is involved in the regulation of cellular and immune responses. Here, we investigated the expression profile of genes involved in the cell cycle and different cytokines upon BBR-mediated AhR activation on AML THP-1 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 cells and normal monocytes were treated with different concentrations of BBR (10 muM, 25 muM, 50 muM, and 100 muM) for 24 and 48 hr. The cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted to evaluate the expression of AhR, cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta), p21, p27, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and p53. Cellular expression of AhR was also assessed using immunofluorescence method. ELISA was used to determine the level of IL-10 and IL-12 cytokines. RESULTS: BBR inhibits the proliferation of THP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with minimal toxicity on normal monocytes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment increased the cellular expression of AhR. The AhR target genes (CYP1A1, IL1beta) were overexpressed upon BBR treatment. BBR downregulated Cdk2 and upregulated p21, p27 and p53 genes in THP-1 cells. IL-10 was significantly increased upon BBR treatment, while IL-12 was not significantly changed in all combinations. CONCLUSION: BBR could be introduced as an effective chemotherapeutic agent against AML by giving rise to the expression of CDK inhibitors and anti-inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of CDK2.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'Berberine', 'Cell cycle regulation', 'THP-1']",,,PMC5478781,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-570 in CML development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of miR-570 in CML samples and cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR. Glucose uptake and ATP concentration detection assays were used to analyze cell glucose metabolism. MTT and western blot assays were performed for cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The targets of miR-570 were predicted by bioinformatics and confirmed using luciferase activity, qRT-PCR and western blot assays. RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-570 were significantly reduced in CML clinical samples and cells. Overexpression of miR-570 inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and suppressed glucose metabolism in CML cells. Insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and IRS2 were identified as direct targets of miR-570. IRS1 or IRS2 were knocked down in K562 cells. Loss of IRS1/2 expression led to suppressed cell proliferation, elevated apoptosis, and decreased glucose metabolism in CML cells, which is consistent with their roles as miR-570 targets. CONCLUSION: MiR-570 directly targeted IRS1 and IRS2 in CML, suppressing cell proliferation and glucose metabolism.

We identified 365 patients with t(11;14), and 730 matched controls:132 patients with non-(11;14) translocations and 598 patients with no chromosomal translocation. The median progression-free survival for the three groups were 23.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 20.8-27.6), 19.0 (95% CI, 15.8-22.7) and 28.3 (95% CI, 25.7-30.6) months, respectively (P<0.01). The median overall survival (OS) for t(11;14), non-(11;14) translocation and no-translocation groups were 74.4 (95% CI, 64.8-89.3), 49.8 (95% CI, 40.0-60.6) and 103.6 (95% CI, 85.2-112.3) months, respectively (P<0.01). Excluding those with 17p abnormality, the median OS in the three groups were 81.7 (95% CI, 67.0-90.7), 58.2 (95% CI, 47.0-76.4) and 108.3 (95% CI, 92.4-140.1) months, respectively (P<0.01). The above relationship held true in patients with age <65 years, international staging system (ISS) I/II stage or those who received novel agent-based induction. Advanced age (hazard ratio (HR): 1.98), 17p abnormality (HR: 2.2) and ISS III stage (HR: 1.59) at diagnosis predicted reduced OS in patients with t(11;14).

Recent evidence suggests that BMI1 is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA double strand breaks where it facilitates histone H2A ubiquitination and DNA double strand break repair by homologous recombination. Here we show that miR-15a and miR-16 expression is decreased during the initial period after DNA damage where it would otherwise down-regulate BMI1, impairing DNA repair. Elevated miR-15a and miR-16 levels down-regulated BMI1 and other polycomb group proteins like RING1A, RING1B, EZH2 and also altered the expression of proteins associated with the BMI1 dependent ubiquitination pathway. Antagonizing the expression of miR-15a and miR-16, enhanced BMI1 protein levels and increased DNA repair. Further, overexpression of miR-15a and miR-16 sensitized breast cancer cells to DNA damage induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Our results suggest that miR-15a and miR-16 mediate the down-regulation of BMI1, which impedes DNA repair while elevated levels can sensitize breast cancer cells to doxorubicin leading to apoptotic cell death.

Epub 2017 Jun 27.,"Mutational signatures in cancer genomes have implicated the APOBEC3 cytosine deaminases in oncogenesis, possibly offering a therapeutic vulnerability. Elevated APOBEC3B expression has been detected in solid tumors, but expression of APOBEC3A (A3A) in cancer has not been described to date. Here, we report that A3A is highly expressed in subsets of pediatric and adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We modeled A3A expression in the THP1 AML cell line by introducing an inducible A3A gene. A3A expression caused ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 and cell-cycle arrest, consistent with replication checkpoint activation. Further, replication checkpoint blockade via small-molecule inhibition of ATR kinase in cells expressing A3A led to apoptosis and cell death. Although DNA damage checkpoints are broadly activated in response to A3A activity, synthetic lethality was specific to ATR signaling via Chk1 and did not occur with ATM inhibition. Our findings identify elevation of A3A expression in AML cells, enabling apoptotic sensitivity to inhibitors of the DNA replication checkpoint and suggesting it as a candidate biomarker for ATR inhibitor therapy.

Epub 2017 Jun 27.,"Although some patients with acute leukemia have good prognoses, the prognosis of adult and pediatric patients who relapse or cannot tolerate standard chemotherapy is poor. Inhibition of WEE1 with AZD1775 has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to genotoxic chemotherapies, including cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-ALL. Inhibition of WEE1 impairs homologous recombination by indirectly inhibiting BRCA2. Thus, we sought to determine whether AZD1775 could sensitize cells to the PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib. We found that combined treatment with AZD1775 and olaparib was synergistic in AML and ALL cells, and this combination impaired proliferative capacity upon drug withdrawal. AZD1775 impaired homologous recombination in olaparib-treated cells, resulting in enhanced DNA damage accumulation and apoptosis induction. This combination enhanced disease control and increased survival in a murine AML model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined treatment with AZD1775 and olaparib reduces proliferation and colony formation and increases apoptosis in AML patient samples. In aggregate, these studies raise the possibility of rational combinations of targeted agents for leukemia in patients for whom conventional chemotherapeutics may not be effective or well tolerated.

Epub 2017 Jun 27.,"Although the involvement of Rho proteins in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases is well studied, little is known about the role of their upstream regulators, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). Here, we sought to identify the RhoGEFs involved in monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1)-induced vascular wall remodeling. We found that, among the RhoGEFs tested, MCP1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p115 RhoGEF but not of PDZ RhoGEF or leukemia-associated RhoGEF in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Moreover, p115 RhoGEF inhibition suppressed MCP1-induced HASMC migration and proliferation. Consistent with these observations, balloon injury (BI) induced p115 RhoGEF tyrosine phosphorylation in rat common carotid arteries, and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of its levels substantially attenuated BI-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, resulting in reduced neointima formation. Furthermore, depletion of p115 RhoGEF levels also abrogated MCP1- or BI-induced Rac1-NFATc1-cyclin D1-CDK6-PKN1-CDK4-PAK1 signaling, which, as we reported previously, is involved in vascular wall remodeling. Our findings also show that protein kinase N1 (PKN1) downstream of Rac1-cyclin D1/CDK6 and upstream of CDK4-PAK1 in the p115 RhoGEF-Rac1-NFATc1-cyclin D1-CDK6-PKN1-CDK4-PAK1 signaling axis is involved in the modulation of vascular wall remodeling. Of note, we also observed that CCR2-Gi/o-Fyn signaling mediates MCP1-induced p115 RhoGEF and Rac1 GTPase activation. These findings suggest that p115 RhoGEF is critical for MCP1-induced HASMC migration and proliferation in vitro and for injury-induced neointima formation in vivo by modulating Rac1-NFATc1-cyclin D1-CDK6-PKN1-CDK4-PAK1 signaling.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NFAT transcription factor', '*cell migration', '*cell proliferation', '*guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)', '*vascular smooth muscle cells']","['R01 HL064165/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069908/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (ARHGEF1 protein, human)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",PMC5572933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 24.,"B-lineage and myeloid leukemia cells are often transformed by the same oncogenes, but have different biological and clinical characteristics. Although B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells are characterized by a state of chronic energy deficit, myeloid leukemia cells show abundant energy reserve. Interestingly, fasting has been demonstrated to inhibit selectively the development of B-ALL but not myeloid leukemia, further suggesting that lineage identity may be linked to divergent metabolic states in hematopoietic malignancies. The B-lymphoid transcription factors IKZF1, EBF1, and PAX5 are essential for early B-cell development and commitment to B-cell identity. However, in >80% of human pre-B-ALL cases, the leukemic clones harbor genetic lesions of these transcription factors. The significance of these defects has only recently been investigated. Here, we discuss the unexpected function of a B-lymphoid transcriptional program as a metabolic barrier against malignant transformation of B-cell precursor cells. The metabolic gatekeeper function of B-lymphoid transcription factors may force silent preleukemic clones carrying potentially oncogenic lesions to remain in a latent state. In addition, this program sets the threshold for responses to glucocorticoids in pre-B-ALL. Finally, the link between the tumor-suppressor and metabolic functions of B-lymphoid transcription factors is matched by observations in clinical trials: obesity and hyperglycemia are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with pre-B-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"Sub-acute neurotoxicity is a well-known complication to high-dose and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) treatment of children with leukemia. Symptoms can be treated safely by dextromethorphan, a non-competitive antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR). In a female with subacute MTX neurotoxicity, we observed an electroencephalographic (EEG) with extreme delta brush. Extreme delta brush is an EEG pattern previously described in patients with NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis. The observations suggest that the mechanism of this neurotoxicity may be mediated by the NMDAR. Furthermore, extreme EEG delta brush should suggest a diagnosis of MTX associated subacute neurotoxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2017 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier', 'Ltd.

Yet, such approaches have hardly been applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, probably due to the high number of features typically exceeding the number of studied individuals. Results: After a brief overview of how deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), a deep learning approach, can be adapted to SNP data in principle, we specifically present a way to alleviate the dimensionality problem by partitioned learning. We propose a sparse regression approach to coarsely screen the joint distribution of SNPs, followed by training several DBMs on SNP partitions that were identified by the screening. Aggregate features representing SNP patterns and the corresponding SNPs are extracted from the DBMs by a combination of statistical tests and sparse regression. In simulated case-control data, we show how this can uncover complex SNP patterns and augment results from univariate approaches, while maintaining type 1 error control. Time-to-event endpoints are considered in an application with acute myeloid leukemia patients, where SNP patterns are modeled after a pre-screening based on gene expression data. The proposed approach identified three SNPs that seem to jointly influence survival in a validation dataset. This indicates the added value of jointly investigating SNPs compared to standard univariate analyses and makes partitioned learning of DBMs an interesting complementary approach when analyzing SNP data.

Results: Of 107 patients (59 males and 48 females) , with a median age of 33 (16-59) years old and a median follow-up of 36.5 (5.3-79.1) months, the overall relapse rate was 20.6% (22/107) , and overall mortality rate was 18.7% (20/107).

At a median follow-up of 34 months, the 5-year probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 61.0% and 70.0%, respectively in HID HSCT. The 3-year incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality was 22.7% and 16.4%. Multivariate analysis showed that the post-HSCT BCR-ABL transcript level on +30day was a significant factor affecting relapse rate.

Mean concentrations of free cytarabine in cerebrospinal fluid remained above the cytotoxic threshold of 0.4 muM for 2 weeks after dosing. Animals treated with liposomal cytarabine exhibited normal recognition and spatial memory 4 weeks after injection. In contrast, exposure to IT MTX led to impaired cognitive function. In addition, mean hematocrit on day 11 was significantly lower in the MTX-treated animals (30.8%; 95% confidence interval, 27.0%-34.7%; n=6) compared with that in the liposomal cytarabine-treated animals (39.5%; 95% confidence interval, 38.4%-40.6%; n=6; P<0.0001).

Epub 2017 Jul 31.,"Despite recent progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of acute leukemias, treatment options for these diseases have not changed significantly over the last few decades. We present a nonexhaustive summary of the current cytogenetic and molecular changes associated with acute leukemias in disease prognostication and potential targeted therapies. An emerging paradigm is that many genetic or molecular alterations target similar signal transduction, transcriptional, and epigenetic pathways. Some of these targets may be used as predictive biomarkers for the development of novel targeted therapies that depart significantly from conventional chemotherapy, the current mainstay for the treatment of acute leukemias. Established leukemia-specific predictive biomarkers for precision medicine include those genetic lesions such as BCR-ABL1 for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and PML-RARalpha for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Evidence indicates that targeted therapy for FLT-ITD gene mutations with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors can extend its use from relapsed disease to up-front induction therapy. Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia in adults predicts benefit with high-dose cytarabine in the absence of KIT mutation. Although risk-adapted therapy based on genetic abnormalities in acute leukemias has allowed the beginning of personalized treatment and selective use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the prognostic and/or predictive value of many novel mutations of the acute leukemic genome is yet to be elucidated. Many challenges lie ahead in targeted therapies due to overlapping of chromosomal and molecular lesions as well as other limiting factors. Future work should focus on the understanding of pathogenetic changes that lead to leukemogenesis, which may guide the rational design of new targeted therapies and make the drive toward precision medicine for acute leukemias one step closer.","['(c) 2017 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene mutations', 'precision medicine', 'predictive markers', 'prognostic markers', 'risk-adapted therapy', 'targeted therapy']",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A convenience sample of 39,088 SCPs completed for cancer survivors with an Internet-based SCP tool was examined; it included 5847 CC survivors (15%; CC was defined as chronic leukemia and/or recurrent/metastatic cancer of another nature). Patient-reported treatment effects and follow-up care patterns were compared between CC survivors and survivors treated with curative intent (CI). Responses from a follow-up survey regarding SCP satisfaction and use were reviewed. RESULTS: CC survivors had greater odds of experiencing multiple treatment-related effects than survivors treated with CI; these effects included fatigue, cognitive changes, dyspnea, peripheral neuropathy, lymphedema, and erectile dysfunction. Nearly half of CC survivors were managed by an oncologist alone, and they were less likely than CI patients to be comanaged by a primary care provider and an oncologist. Fewer SCPs were generated by health care providers (HCPs) for CC survivors versus CI survivors. A smaller proportion of CC users versus CI users rated their experience and satisfaction with the SCP tool as very good or excellent, and CC users were less likely to share the HCP summary with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of CC survivors, often considered incurable but treatable, seek survivorship support. Tools to facilitate participation, communication, and coordination of care are valuable for these patients, and future iterations of SCPs should be designed to address the particular circumstances of living with CC.

Epub 2017 Jun 27.,"BACKGROUND: Large epidemiologic studies have reported the premature onset of age-related conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus, in childhood cancer survivors, decades earlier than in their peers. The authors investigated whether young adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a biologic phenotype of cellular ageing and chronic inflammation. METHODS: Plasma inflammatory cytokines were measured using a cytometric bead array in 87 asymptomatic young adult survivors of childhood ALL (median age, 25 years; age range, 18-35 years) who attended annual follow-up clinic and compared with healthy, age-matched and sex-matched controls. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was measured using Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: Survivors had significant elevation of plasma interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, IL-17a, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (all P < .05). A raised high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level (>0.8 mg/dL) was related to increased odds of having metabolic syndrome (odds ratio, 7.256; 95% confidence interval, 1.501-35.074). Survivors also had significantly shorter LTL compared with controls (median, 9866 vs 10,392 base pairs; P = .021). Compared with published data, LTL in survivors was similar to that in healthy individuals aged 20 years older. Survivors who received cranial irradiation had shorter LTL compared with those who had not (P = .013). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic young adult survivors of childhood ALL demonstrate a biologic profile of chronic inflammation and telomere attrition, consistent with an early onset of cellular processes that drive accelerated aging. These processes may explain the premature development of age-related chronic conditions in childhood cancer survivors. Understanding their molecular basis may facilitate targeted interventions to disrupt the accelerated aging process and its long-term impact on overall health. Cancer 2017;123:4207-4214.

The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated kinase (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-Related kinase (ATR) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PKcs) are among the first that are activated upon induction of DNA damage, and are central regulators of a network that controls DNA repair, apoptosis and cell survival. As part of a tumor-suppressive pathway, ATM and ATR activate p53 through phosphorylation, thereby regulating the transcriptional activity of p53. DNA damage also results in the formation of so-called ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that represent complexes of DNA damage sensor and repair proteins that accumulate at the sites of DNA damage, which are visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Co-localization of proteins in IRIFs, however, does not necessarily imply direct protein-protein interactions, as the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited. In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is a novel technique that allows the direct visualization of protein-protein interactions in cells and tissues with unprecedented specificity and sensitivity. This technique is based on the spatial proximity of specific antibodies binding to the proteins of interest. When the interrogated proteins are within ~40 nm an amplification reaction is triggered by oligonucleotides that are conjugated to the antibodies, and the amplification product is visualized by fluorescent labeling, yielding a signal that corresponds to the subcellular location of the interacting proteins. Using the established functional interaction between ATM and p53 as an example, it is demonstrated here how PLA can be used in suspension cell cultures to study the direct interactions between proteins that are integral parts of the DNA damage response.",,,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)']",PMC5608333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the global epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs and repetitive sequences in cancer has not been well investigated, particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study focuses on a unique approach: the immunoprecipitation-based capture of double-stranded, methylated DNA fragments using methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins, followed by next-generation sequencing (MBD-seq). CLL patient samples belonging to two prognostic subgroups (5 IGVH mutated samples + 5 IGVH unmutated samples) were used in this study. Analysis revealed 5,800 hypermethylated and 12,570 hypomethylated CLL-specific differentially methylated genes (cllDMGs) compared to normal healthy controls. Importantly, these results identified several CLL-specific, differentially methylated lncRNAs, repetitive elements, and protein-coding genes with potential prognostic value. This work outlines a detailed protocol for an MBD-seq and bioinformatics pipeline developed for the comprehensive analysis of global methylation profiles in highly CpG-rich regions using CLL patient samples. Finally, a protein-coding gene and an lncRNA were validated using pyrosequencing, which is a highly quantitative method to analyze CpG methylation levels to further corroborate the findings from the MBD-seq protocol.",,,,,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",PMC5608441,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite major advances in understanding the genetic landscape of AML and its impact on the pathophysiology and biology of the disease, standard treatment options have not significantly changed during the past three decades. AML is characterized by multiple somatically acquired mutations that affect genes of different functional categories. Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, such as DNMT3A, ASXL1, TET2, IDH1, and IDH2, are commonly acquired early and are present in the founding clone. By contrast, mutations involving NPM1 or signalling molecules (e.g., FLT3, RAS gene family) are typically secondary events that occur later during leukaemogenesis.

Little is known about how medication-related issues affect CML patients' adherence to TKI therapy in Malaysia. This qualitative study aimed to explore these issues. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual face-to-face, semistructured interviews were conducted at the hematology outpatient clinics of two medical centers in Malaysia from August 2015 to January 2016. CML patients aged >/=18 years who were prescribed a TKI were invited to participate in the study. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Four themes were identified from 18 interviews: 1) concerns about adverse reactions to TKIs, 2) personal beliefs regarding the use of TKIs, 3) mismanagement of TKIs in daily lives, and 4) financial burden in accessing treatment. Participants skipped their TKIs due to ineffective emesis control measures and perceived wastage of medication from vomiting. Participants also modified their TKI therapy due to fear of potential harm from long-term use, and stopped taking their TKIs based on belief in curative claims of traditional medicines and misconception about therapeutic effects of TKIs. Difficulty in integrating the dosing requirements of TKIs into daily lives led to unintentional skipping of doses, as well as the risk of toxicities from inappropriate dosing intervals or food interactions. Furthermore, financial constraints also resulted in delayed initiation of TKIs, missed clinic appointments, and treatment interruptions. CONCLUSION: Malaysian CML patients encountered a range of medication-related issues leading to a complex pattern of nonadherence to TKI therapy. Further studies should investigate whether regular contact with patients to improve understanding of treatment rationale, to elicit and address patients' concerns about adverse reactions, and to empower patients with skills to self-manage their medications might promote better adherence to TKIs and improve CML patients' outcome.",,['NOTNLM'],"['adherence', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'medication-related issues', 'qualitative study', 'thematic analysis', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,PMC5476765,,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: As most cholangiocarcinomas are chemotherapy-resistant due to mechanisms preventing tumor cell death, we investigated the effect of Cisplatin on cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCA) cell lines KMCH-1 and Mz-Ch-1. Polo-like kinases (PLK) are important regulators of the cell cycle and their inhibition is discussed as a potential therapy while PLK inhibition can regulate apoptotic mediators. Here, cells were treated with PLK inhibitor BI6727 (Volasertib), Cisplatin, and in combination of both compounds. Cell viability was assessed by MTT; apoptosis was measured by DAPI staining and caspase-3/-7 assay. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to measure expression levels of apoptosis-related molecules Bax and Bcl-2. RESULTS: The cell viability in the CCA cell lines KMCH-1 and Mz-Ch-1 was reduced in all treatment conditions compared to vehicle-treated cells. Co-treatment with BI6727 and cisplatin could even enhance the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin single treatment. Thus, co-treatment of cisplatin with BI6727 could slightly enhance the cytotoxic effect of the cisplatin in both cell lines whereas there was evidence of increased apoptosis induction solely in Mz-Ch-1 as compared to KMCH-1. Moreover, PLK inhibition decreases protein levels of Bcl-2; an effect that can be reversed by the proteasomal degradation inhibitor MG-132. In contrast, protein levels of Bax were not found to be altered by PLK inhibition. These findings indicate that cytotoxic effects of Cisplatin in Mz-Ch-1 cells can be enhanced by cotreatment with BI6727. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, BI6727 treatment can sensitize CCA cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis with proteasomal Bcl-2 degradation as an additional pro-apoptotic effect.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy resistance', 'Cisplatin', 'Hedgehog pathway', 'Myeloid cell leukemia-1', 'Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand']",,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pteridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",PMC5473120,,,,,,['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our current study is being conducted to elucidate the impact of HLA-DPB1 mismatch, along with the effect of other HLA loci mismatches at the allele level. HLA six loci alleles were retrospectively typed in 1157 Japanese donors and patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent transplantation with a single unit of cord blood. HLA-DPB1 mismatch was associated with a significant reduction in leukemia relapse (hazard ratio 0.61, P<0.001), whereas the other HLA loci allele-level mismatches did not. No significant effect of HLA-DPB1 mismatch was observed in the risk of acute GVHD, engraftment or mortality.

Epub 2017 Jun 26.,"Kindlin-2 (K2), a 4.1R-ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain adaptor protein, mediates numerous cellular responses, including integrin activation. The C-terminal 15-amino acid sequence of K2 is remarkably conserved across species but is absent in canonical FERM proteins, including talin. In CHO cells expressing integrin alphaIIbbeta3, co-expression of K2 with talin head domain resulted in robust integrin activation, but this co-activation was lost after deletion of as few as seven amino acids from the K2 C terminus. This dependence on the C terminus was also observed in activation of endogenous alphaIIbbeta3 in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells and beta1 integrin activation in macrophage-like RAW264.1 cells. Kindlin-1 (K1) exhibited a similar dependence on its C terminus for integrin activation. Expression of the K2 C terminus as an extension of membrane-anchored P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) inhibited integrin-dependent cell spreading. Deletion of the K2 C terminus did not affect its binding to the integrin beta3 cytoplasmic tail, but combined biochemical and NMR analyses indicated that it can insert into the F2 subdomain. We suggest that this insertion determines the topology of the K2 FERM domain, and its deletion may affect the positioning of the membrane-binding functions of the F2 subdomain and the integrin-binding properties of its F3 subdomain. Free C-terminal peptide can still bind to K2 and displace the endogenous K2 C terminus but may not restore the conformation needed for integrin co-activation. Our findings indicate that the extreme C terminus of K2 is essential for integrin co-activation and highlight the importance of an atypical architecture of the K2 FERM domain in regulating integrin activation.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cell adhesion', '*integrin', '*kindlin', '*membrane', '*protein chemistry', '*talin']","['P01 HL076491/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL073311/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL096062/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062823/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD019972/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (FERMT3 protein, human)', '0 (ITGA2B protein, human)', '0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha2)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Talin)']",PMC5572925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 26.,"The mouse p19(Arf) (human p14(ARF)) tumor suppressor protein, encoded in part from an alternative reading frame of the Ink4a (Cdkn2a) gene, inhibits the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase to activate p53. Arf is not expressed in most normal tissues of young mice but is induced by high thresholds of aberrant hyperproliferative signals, thereby activating p53 in incipient tumor cells that have experienced oncogene activation. The single Arf mRNA encodes two distinct polypeptides, including full-length p19(Arf) and N-terminally truncated and unstable p15(smArf) (""small mitochondrial Arf"") initiated from an internal in-frame AUG codon specifying methionine-45. Interactions of p19(Arf) with Mdm2, or separately with nucleophosmin (NPM, B23) that localizes and stabilizes p19(Arf) within the nucleolus, require p19(Arf) N-terminal amino acids that are not present within p15(smArf) We have generated mice that produce either smARF alone or M45A-mutated (smArf-deficient) full-length p19(Arf) proteins. BCR-ABL-expressing pro/pre-B cells producing smArf alone are as oncogenic as their Arf-null counterparts in generating acute lymphoblastic leukemia when infused into unconditioned syngeneic mice. In contrast, smArf-deficient cells from mice of the Arf(M45A) strain are as resistant as wild-type Arf(+/+) cells to comparable oncogenic challenge and do not produce tumors. Apart from being prone to tumor development, Arf-null mice are blind, and their male germ cells exhibit defects in meiotic maturation and sperm production. Although Arf(M45A) mice manifest the latter defects, smArf alone remarkably rescues both of these p53-independent developmental phenotypes.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arf tumor suppressor', '*BCR-ABL acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*hyaloid vasculature', '*p53', '*spermatogenesis']",['HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",PMC5514764,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5516-6206'],,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 26.,"Exclusive of membrane-proximal mutations seen commonly in chronic neutrophilic leukemia (e.g., T618I), functionally defective mutations in the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor (CSF3R) have been reported only in severe congenital and idiopathic neutropenia patients. Here, we describe the first activating mutation in the fibronectin-like type III domain of the extracellular region of CSF3R (W341C) in a leukemia patient. This mutation transformed cells via cysteine-mediated intermolecular disulfide bonds, leading to receptor dimerization. Interestingly, a CSF3R cytoplasmic truncation mutation (W791X) found on the same allele as the extracellular mutation and the expansion of the compound mutation was associated with increased leukocytosis and disease progression of the patient. Notably, the primary patient sample and cells transformed by W341C and W341C/W791X exhibited sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. We further showed that disruption of original cysteine pairs in the CSF3R extracellular domain resulted in either gain- or loss-of-function changes, part of which was attributable to cysteine-mediated dimer formation. This, therefore, represents the first characterization of unpaired cysteines that mediate both gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes. Overall, our results show the structural and functional importance of conserved extracellular cysteine pairs in CSF3R and suggest the necessity for broader screening of CSF3R extracellular domain in leukemia patients.

Epub 2017 Jun 24.,"In hematopoietic cell development, the transcriptional program is strictly regulated in a lineage- and stage-specific manner that requires a number of transcription factors to work in a cascade or in a loop, in addition to interactions with nonhematopoietic cells in the microenvironment. Disruption of the transcriptional program alters the cellular state and may predispose cells to the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. Early studies have shown that proteins that promote cell differentiation often serve as tumor suppressors, whereas inhibitors of those proteins act as oncogenes in the context of acute leukemia. A prime example is T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of immature stage thymocytes. Although a relatively small number of genetic abnormalities are observed in T-ALL, these abnormalities are crucial for leukemogenesis. Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors in T-ALL are transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis. The transformation process in T-ALL is efficient and orchestrated; the oncogene disrupts the transcriptional program directing T-cell differentiation and also uses its native ability as a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis. This imbalance in the transcriptional program is a primary determinant underlying the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. In this review, we focus on the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and the tumor-suppressor E-proteins and discuss the malignant cell state, the transcriptional circuit, and the consequence of molecular abnormalities in T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The performance of diagnostic criteria, studied in the pediatric population, is yet to be validated in the adult population. Some of the criteria include cytopenias and organomegaly that are inherent features to malignant processes, thus making the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a challenge in patients with cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 54-year-old white man with history of metastatic maxillary sinus adenoid cystic carcinoma who had severe liver injury and cytopenias with progressive clinical deterioration. We performed an evaluation, by flow cytometry, of the expression of surface markers in his natural killer cells that revealed remarkable abnormalities. His syndrome eventually fulfilled criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and he received therapy with steroids with interval clinical improvement. Unfortunately, he refused further cytotoxic treatment and died 2 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are suboptimal for adult patients with cancer resulting in delays in diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment. The diagnostic criteria have to be re-evaluated in patients with cancer; novel, easily available, and accurate diagnostic methods are needed.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult', 'Cancer', 'Diagnosis', 'Hemophagocytosis']",,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",PMC5485603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calcium is accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPases (SERCA enzymes). Because lymphocyte function is critically dependent on SERCA activity, it is important to understand qualitative and quantitative changes of SERCA protein expression that occur during B lymphoid differentiation and leukemogenesis. METHODS: In this work we investigated the modulation of SERCA expression during the pharmacologically induced differentiation of leukemic precursor B lymphoblast cell lines that carry the E2A-PBX1 fusion oncoprotein. Changes of SERCA levels during differentiation were determined and compared to those of established early B lymphoid differentiation markers. SERCA expression of the cells was compared to that of mature B cell lines as well, and the effect of the direct inhibition of SERCA-dependent calcium transport on the differentiation process was investigated. RESULTS: We show that E2A-PBX1(+) leukemia cells simultaneously express SERCA2 and SERCA3-type calcium pumps; however, their SERCA3 expression is markedly inferior to that of mature B cells. Activation of protein kinase C enzymes by phorbol ester leads to phenotypic differentiation of the cells, and this is accompanied by the induction of SERCA3 expression. Direct pharmacological inhibition of SERCA-dependent calcium transport during phorbol ester treatment interferes with the differentiation process. CONCLUSION: These data show that the calcium pump composition of the ER is concurrent with increased SERCA3 expression during the differentiation of precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, that a cross-talk exists between SERCA function and the control of differentiation, and that SERCA3 may constitute an interesting new marker for the study of early B cell phenotype.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Calcium transport', '*Endoplasmic reticulum', '*Phorbol ester', '*Pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*SERCA']",,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",PMC5485704,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5025-3087'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We assessed the effect of age on clinical characteristics and outcomes in 286 lenalidomide-treated MDS patients with del(5q) from two multicenter trials. RESULTS: A total of 33.9, 34.3, and 31.8% patients were aged <65 years, >/=65 to <75 years, and >/=75 years, respectively. Age <65 years was associated with less favorable International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk and additional cytopenias at baseline versus older age groups, significantly lower cytogenetic response rates (p = 0.022 vs. >/=65 to <75 years; p = 0.047 vs. >/=75 years), and higher rates of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression (Gray's test, p = 0.013). Lenalidomide was equally well tolerated across age groups, producing consistently high rates of red blood cell transfusion independence >/=26 weeks.

Epub 2017 Jun 16.,"Cytarabine (Ara-c) has been an important agent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment for more than 40 years. While, the mechanisms underlying low dose cytarabine (LD Ara-c) is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of LD Ara-C in vitro. U937 and HEL cell lines were treated with increasing dose of Ara-C and showed growth inhibition rates in a time and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with LD Ara-C (50nM) induced a time-dependent increase in expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin1, but degradation of sequestosome1 (p62) in both U937 and HEL cells. Characteristic of autophagosomes appeared after 24h treatment. Meanwhile, deregulation of Akt-mTOR pathway was also detected. When cultured in presence of autophagy inhibitors, autophagy and differentiation was reversed, and cell growth inhibition was also attenuated. Similar phenomenon could also be seen when beclin1 expression was down-regulated. Taken together, we concluded that LD Ara-C can induce autophagy in AML cells and appeared to play an important role in differentiation and death. Down-regulation of Akt-mTOR pathway is involved in these processes. We suggest that cytarabine-induced autophagy is not a pro-survival mechanism, but accounts for its antineoplastic effects.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This review perspective will highlight recent advances, development, and applications of the multivalent stable isotope tracer deuterium oxide (D2O) to the study of substrate metabolism with particular reference to protein, lipids, and nucleic acids, and how these methods can be readily applied within clinical and pharmaceutical research. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in the application of D2O techniques now permit the simultaneous dynamic measurement of a range of substrates (i.e. protein, lipid, and nucleic acids, along with the potential for OMICs methodologies) with minimal invasiveness further creating opportunities for long-term 'free living' measures that can be used in clinical settings. These techniques have recently been applied to ageing populations and further in cancer patients revealing altered muscle protein metabolism. Additionally, the efficacy of numerous drugs in improving lipoprotein profiles and controlling cellular proliferation in leukaemia have been revealed. SUMMARY: D2O provides opportunities to create a more holistic picture of in-vivo metabolic phenotypes, providing a unique platform for development in clinical applications, and the emerging field of personalized medicine.",,,,,"['0 (Nucleic Acids)', 'J65BV539M3 (Deuterium Oxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, PRMT5 has been validated as an anticancer target in mantle cell lymphoma. In this study, we found a potent and selective PRMT5 inhibitor by performing structure-based virtual screening and hit optimization. The identified compound 17 (IC50 = 0.33 muM) exhibited a broad selectivity against a panel of other methyltransferases. The direct binding of 17 to PRMT5 was validated by surface plasmon resonance experiments, with a Kd of 0.987 muM. Kinetic experiments indicated that 17 was a SAM competitive inhibitor other than the substrate. In addition, 17 showed selective antiproliferative effects against MV4-11 cells, and further studies indicated that the mechanism of cellular antitumor activity was due to the inhibition of PRMT5 mediated SmD3 methylation. 17 may represent a promising lead compound to understand more about PRMT5 and potentially assist the development of treatments for leukemia indications.",,,,,"['0 (Acetanilides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (SNRPD3 protein, human)', '0 (methyl 2-(2-((5-methoxy-1H-benzo(d)imidazol-2-yl)thio)acetamido)benzoate)', '0 (snRNP Core Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3864-8382'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identified C/D box snoRNAs and rRNA 2'-O-methylation as critical determinants of leukaemic stem cell activity. Leukaemogenesis by AML1-ETO required expression of the groucho-related amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES). AES functioned by inducing snoRNA/RNP formation via interaction with the RNA helicase DDX21. Similarly, global loss of C/D box snoRNAs with concomitant loss of rRNA 2'-O-methylation resulted in decreased leukaemia self-renewal potential. Genomic deletion of either C/D box snoRNA SNORD14D or SNORD35A suppressed clonogenic potential of leukaemia cells in vitro and delayed leukaemogenesis in vivo. We further showed that AML1-ETO9a, MYC and MLL-AF9 all enhanced snoRNA formation.

Epub 2017 Jun 26.,"Leukemias harboring the ETV6-ABL1 fusion represent a rare subset of hematological malignancies with unfavorable outcomes. The constitutively active chimeric Etv6-Abl1 tyrosine kinase can be specifically inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although TKIs represent an important therapeutic tool, so far, the mechanism underlying the potential TKI resistance in ETV6-ABL1-positive malignancies has not been studied in detail. To address this issue, we established a TKI-resistant ETV6-ABL1-positive leukemic cell line through long-term exposure to imatinib. ETV6-ABL1-dependent mechanisms (including fusion gene/protein mutation, amplification, enhanced expression or phosphorylation) and increased TKI efflux were excluded as potential causes of resistance. We showed that TKI effectively inhibited the Etv6-Abl1 kinase activity in resistant cells, and using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing, we confirmed that the resistant cells became independent from the ETV6-ABL1 oncogene. Through analysis of the genomic and proteomic profiles of resistant cells, we identified an acquired mutation in the GNB1 gene, K89M, as the most likely cause of the resistance. We showed that cells harboring mutated GNB1 were capable of restoring signaling through the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, whose activation is inhibited by TKI. This alternative GNB1(K89M)-mediated pro-survival signaling rendered ETV6-ABL1-positive leukemic cells resistant to TKI therapy. The mechanism of TKI resistance is independent of the targeted chimeric kinase and thus is potentially relevant not only to ETV6-ABL1-positive leukemias but also to a wider spectrum of malignancies treated by kinase inhibitors.",,,,,"['0 (GNB1 protein, human)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TEL-ABL fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",PMC5666322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 26.,"L-asparaginase is a critical chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It hydrolyzes plasma asparagine into aspartate and NH3, causing asparagine deficit and inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death. However, patient relapse often occurs due to development of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase is unknown. Therefore, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance in primary leukemic cells. By unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening, we found that among 10 resistant ALL clones, six hits were for opioid receptor mu 1 (oprm1), two hits were for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1) and another two hits were for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (ube2c). We also found that OPRM1 is expressed in all leukemic cells tested. Specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers L-asparaginase resistance, validating our genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening data. Methadone, an agonist of OPRM1, enhances the sensitivity of parental leukemic cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone, and that OPRM1 loss promotes leukemic cell survival likely through downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this premise, patient leukemic cells with relatively high levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to OPRM1-depleted leukemic cells, further indicating that OPRM1 loss has a crucial role in L-asparaginase resistance in leukemic patients. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time, a novel OPRM1-mediated mechanism for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones. Oprm1 may also be utilized for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL.",,,,['MOP-123400/CIHR/Canada'],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (OPRM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid, mu)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2C protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",PMC5658664,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLA incompatibilities between donor and recipient might enhance the alloreactivity of natural killer (NK) cells after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We studied the reconstitution of NK cells and KIR-L mismatch in 54 patients who underwent a RIC-UCBT for AML in CR in a prospective phase II clinical trial. After RIC-UCBT, NK cells displayed phenotypic features of both activation and immaturity. Restoration of their polyfunctional capacities depended on the timing of their acquisition of phenotypic markers of maturity. The incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was correlated with low CD16 expression (P=0.043) and high HLA-DR expression (P=0.0008), whereas overall survival was associated with increased frequency of NK-cell degranulation (P=0.001). These features reflect a general impairment of the NK licensing process in HLA-mismatched HSCT and may aid the development of future strategies for selecting optimal UCB units and enhancing immune recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent discoveries by high resolution genomic technologies have characterized the biology of relapsed leukemia, most notably pathways leading to the drug resistant phenotype. These observations open the possibility of targeting such pathways to prevent and/or treat relapse. Likewise, early experiences with new immunotherapeutic approaches have shown great promise. Areas covered: We performed a literature search on PubMed and recent meeting abstracts using the keywords below. We focused on the biology and clonal evolution of relapsed disease highlighting potential new targets of therapy. We further summarized the results of early trials of the three most prominent immunotherapy agents currently under investigation. Expert commentary: Discovery of targetable pathways that lead to drug resistance and recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy show great promise towards treating this aggressive disease. The best way to treat relapse, however, is to prevent it which makes incorporation of these new approaches into frontline therapy the best approach. Challenges remain to balance efficacy with toxicity and to prevent the emergence of resistant subclones which is why combining these newer agents with conventional chemotherapy will likely become standard of care.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*bispecific T-cell engagers', '*chimeric antigen receptor T-cells', '*clonal evolution', '*immunotherapy', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*relapse', '*targeted therapy']","['P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC6028000,['NIHMS975685'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"INTRODUCTION: T-cell lymphoma is a relatively rare hematologic malignancy that accounts for 10-20% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Treatment strategies for T-cell lymphomas are different from that for B-cell lymphomas and have poor prognoses. Among various subtypes of T-cell lymphomas, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) has the worst prognosis. To achieve further improvement in the treatment outcome of T-cell lymphomas, several novel agents such as brentuximab vedotin, lenalidomide, romidepsin, and pralatrexate are actively being studied. Mogamulizumab, an anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody, is one of the promising agents for CCR4-positive T-cell lymphomas, especially for ATL. Areas covered: First, basic information about the current treatment strategy of T-cell lymphomas including ATL is described. Then, the authors discuss the current clinical development of mogamulizumab and its clinical implications for T-cell lymphomas. Expert opinion: Mogamulizumab has potent clinical efficacy against CCR4-positive T-cell lymphomas, especially against ATL. Among various toxicities associated with mogamulizumab, skin eruptions are the most significant.

Role of flow cytometry (FC) to diagnose CNS involvement has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We aimed to detect CNS involvement in 42 ALL patients (33 B-ALL, nine T-ALL) at diagnosis by FC and comparing it with CP and to correlate it with known risk factors for CNS disease like Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the cutoff of LDH to predict CSF involvement. For the analysis of categorical/quantitative variables, Fisher's exact test was used. For the analysis of continuous variables, Mann-Whitney test was used. A P value of <.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: CP and FC were positive in five (11.9%) and 11 patients (26.14%) respectively with FC detecting a significantly higher level of involvement (P=.001). All CP-positive cases were FC positive. A LDH value of >472 U/L had a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 62.5% for diagnosis of CSF involvement by FC. CONCLUSIONS: CSF FC detects CNS disease in ALL patients at diagnosis at a rate double than CP alone and is statistically associated with an elevated LDH level. It should be incorporated in the evaluation of CSF to detect CNS involvement.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'cytopathology', 'flow cytometry']",,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8282-7842'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some fungi may be useful for the biotransformation of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), leading to unusual structural changes that modify their biological activities, and other transformations mimic their biosynthetic pathways, generating evidences for the proposed biogenesis. Eight filamentous fungi were screened for their ability to transform different SLs (1 - 9), and microbial reactions yielded compounds 10 - 17, which in turn have been isolated as natural products, thus mimicking their biosynthesis. Their structures were identified based on NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. The cytotoxicities of SLs 1, 4, 6, 7 and 9, and their biotransformed produts (10, 14, 15 and 17) against human cancer cell lines U251 (glia), PC3 (prostate), K562 (leukemia), HCT-15 (colon), MCF7 (breast), and SKLU-1 (lung), were determined, confirming that the presence of Michael acceptor is an important feature for the bioactivity.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Biotransformations', 'Cytotoxic activities', 'Filamentous fungi', 'Germacrolide', 'Sesquiterpene lactones']",,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"MACC1 was identified as a novel player in cancer progression and metastasis, but its role in death receptor-mediated apoptosis is still unexplored. We show that MACC1 knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. For the first time, we provide evidence for STAT signaling as a MACC1 target. MACC1 knockdown drastically reduced STAT1/3 activating phosphorylation, thereby regulating the expression of its apoptosis targets Mcl-1 and Fas. STAT signaling inhibition by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib mimicked MACC1 knockdown-mediated molecular signatures and apoptosis sensitization to Fas activation. Despite the increased Fas expression, the reduced Mcl-1 expression was instrumental in apoptosis sensitization. This reduced Mcl-1-mediated apoptosis sensitization was Bax and Bak dependent. MACC1 knockdown also increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis. MACC1 overexpression enhanced STAT1/3 phosphorylation and increased Mcl-1 expression, which was abrogated by ruxolitinib. The central role of Mcl-1 was strengthened by the resistance of Mcl-1 overexpressing cells to apoptosis induction. The clinical relevance of Mcl-1 regulation by MACC1 was supported by their positive expression correlation in patient-derived tumors. Altogether, we reveal a novel death receptor-mediated apoptosis regulatory mechanism by MACC1 in solid cancers through modulation of the STAT1/3-Mcl-1 axis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to study the characteristics and outcome of a series of MYC-R lymphomas comparing the treatment results between R-CHOP based and a specific intensive regimen for BL (BURKIMAB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with MYC-R. Translocations of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Patients were treated with either, R-CHOP based immunochemotherapy or the Burkitt type regimen, BURKIMAB. RESULTS: Thirty-four MYC-R lymphoma cases were studied: 21 treated with R-CHOP and 13 treated with BURKIMAB. There were no differences in CR rate; 45% (9/20) for R-CHOP and 42% (5/12) for BURKIMAB (P=.99). Although overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of BURKIMAB-treated patients were better than those of R-CHOP-treated (3y-OS: 46 vs. 24%; 3y-PFS: 46 vs. 10%), the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: MYC-R lymphomas show poor outcomes even when treated with intensive immunochemotherapy for BL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Over the last several years, aptamers generated by SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method, have quickly become a new class of targeting ligands for drug delivery applications and recently have been widely exploited in different biomedical applications, due to several potent properties such as high binding affinity and selectivity, low or no immunogenicity and toxicity, low cost and thermal stability. In this review, we presented in details about aptamers involved in targeting, and treatment of leukemia. Moreover, some analytical approaches such as electrochemical and optical aptasensors were introduced for detection and diagnosis of leukemia.

Unfortunately, dysregulated pathways that support transformed CSCs, such as Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, are also critical regulators of healthy SCs. Using the ICG-001 and CWP family of small molecules, we reveal Sam68 as a previously unappreciated modulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling within CSCs. Disruption of CBP-beta-catenin interaction via ICG-001/CWP induces the formation of a Sam68-CBP complex in CSCs that alters Wnt signaling toward apoptosis and differentiation induction.

Methods: All the hospitalized malignant tumor patients including deaths, were monitored from 1995 to 2014 in Shenzhen, and data was analyzed by SPSS 20.0 software. Results: There were 160 988 inpatients of malignant tumors between 1995 and 2014 in Shenzhen. The top three hospitalized tumors were lung (13.64%), liver (11.13%) and breast (7.86%) cancers. Numbers of the malignant tumor inpatients had been rapidly increasing during the past 20 years, 12.3 times in 2014 higher than in 1995. The total number of deaths due to malignant tumors was 19 460.

The aim of the present analysis was to characterize the clinical features and histologic subtypes and to assess the clinical prognostic factors for 696 adult patients with LL, the largest epidemiologic sample to date. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present retrospective cohort study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify adult patients (age, > 18 years) with LL with data recorded from 2001 to 2012. We used multivariate Cox regression models to test the clinical prognostic factors, stratified by the histologic subtype. RESULTS: Of 696 patients with LL (median age, 39 years), 367 (53%) had T-LL and 131 (19%) had B-LL. Patients with T-LL tended to be younger (33 years vs. 48 years), male (66% vs. 50.4%), and less likely to have extranodal involvement (6% vs. 32%) compared with those with B-LL. The 5-year survival rate for those with B-LL versus those with T-LL was not significantly different (45% vs. 48%; P = .58), even in a model adjusted for clinical features, disease stage, primary site, radiotherapy, and year of diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-1.25; P = .63). Multivariate analysis identified age, race, and radiotherapy as independent prognostic factors for outcome in T-LL. Limited tumor stage and the most recent year of diagnosis were favorable prognostic factors for B-LL. CONCLUSION: Adult patients with LL have poor long-term outcomes and novel therapies are needed. Radiotherapy had a positive effect on T-LL outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in active disease is an alternative therapeutic strategy. The increased availability of unrelated donors together with the significant reduction in transplant-related mortality in recent years have opened the possibility for transplantation to a larger number of patients with PRF-AML. Moreover, transplant from unrelated donors may be associated with stronger graft-mediated anti-leukemic effect in comparison to transplantations from HLA-matched sibling donor, which may be of importance in the setting of PRF-AML. METHODS: The current study aimed to address the issue of HSCT for PRF-AML and to compare the outcomes of HSCT from matched sibling donors (n = 660) versus unrelated donors (n = 381), for patients with PRF-AML between 2000 and 2013. The Kaplan-Meier estimator, the cumulative incidence function, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used where appropriate. RESULTS: HSCT provide patients with PRF-AML a 2-year leukemia-free survival and overall survival of about 25 and 30%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, two predictive factors, cytogenetics and time from diagnosis to transplant, were associated with lower leukemia-free survival, whereas Karnofsky performance status at transplant >/=90% was associated with better leukemia-free survival (LFS). Concerning relapse incidence, cytogenetics and time from diagnosis to transplant were associated with increased relapse. Reduced intensity conditioning regimen was the only factor associated with lower non-relapse mortality. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT was able to rescue about one quarter of the patients with PRF-AML. The donor type did not have any impact on PRF patients' outcomes. In contrast, time to transplant was a major prognostic factor for LFS. For patients with PRF-AML who do not have a matched sibling donor, HSCT from an unrelated donor is a suitable option, and therefore, initiation of an early search for allocating a suitable donor is indicated.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Graft-versus-host disease', '*HLA-matched related donor', '*Refractory', '*Unrelated donor']",,,PMC5483262,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4471-418X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report that among the artimisinins, artesunate (ARTS), an orally bioavailable compound has the most potent antileukemic activity in AML models and primary patients' blasts. ARTS was most cytotoxic to the FLT3-ITD+ AML MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells (IC50 values of 1.1 and 0.82muM respectively), inhibited colony formation in primary AML and MDS cells and augmented cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics. ARTS lowered cellular BCL-2 level via ROS induction and increased the cytotoxicity of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199). ARTS treatment led to cellular and mitochondrial ROS accumulation, double stranded DNA damage, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic cascade in AML cell lines. The antileukemic activity of ARTS was further confirmed in MV4-11 and FLT3-ITD+ primary AML cell xenografts as well as MLL-AF9 syngeneic murine AML model where ARTS treatment resulted in significant survival prolongation of treated mice compared to control.

This study aimed to explore the associations between MTHFR or TS genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS This case-control study included 79 ALL patients (case group) and 102 non-ALL patients (control group). Post-PCR genomic DNA sequencing revealed MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C genotypes and TS polymorphisms. The chi(2) test was used to compare differences in MTHFR and TS polymorphisms (including genotypic and allelic distributions) between groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine genetic polymorphisms and ALL risk associations. RESULTS The results indicated that TS 3R allele frequency was significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (chi(2)=7.45, P<0.05). The MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms were not associated with ALL risk. Compared to the TS 2R/2R genotype, subjects carrying TS 2R/3R were twice as likely to develop ALL, and the TS 3R/3R+3R/4R genotype carried a 4-fold higher risk of developing ALL (OR=1.96, CI: 1.14-3.36).

METHODS: d-ROMs test and BAP test were evaluated at diagnosis of 165 patients with CLL and correlated with clinical-biological features and prognosis. RESULTS: An increased oxidative damage (d-ROMs test) and a reduced antioxidant potential (BAP test) were found in CLL patients than normal controls (P<.0001). CLL patients with higher d-ROMs values had higher number of circulating white blood cells and lymphocytes, and higher values of beta2 -microglobulin. Higher d-ROMs values were found in female (P=.0003), in patients with unmutated IgVH (P=.04), unfavourable cytogenetics (P=.002) and more advanced clinical stage (P=.002). Higher BAP test values were found in patients expressing CD49d (P=.01) and with more advanced clinical stage (P=.004). At a median follow-up of 48 months, CLL patients with d-ROMs >/=418 CARR U were found to have a shorter time to first treatment (TFT) (P=.0002), and a reduced survival (P=.006) than others. CLL patients with BAP test values >/=2155 mumol/L had a shorter TFT (P=.008) and a shorter survival (P=.003).

As the best reported response in relapsed and refractory MLL-rearranged AML is around 40%, reinduction treatment is very challenging for those patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of relapsed and refractory AML with MLL-AF9, who did not respond to FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor) regimen reinduction treatment, but achieved complete response and molecular remission after chidamide-based chemotherapy.

Epub 2017 Aug 15.,"BACKGROUND: In acute myeloid leukemia controversy exists about the role of immunophenotyping of the blasts at diagnosis as a potential prognostic factor. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed immunophenotypic marker expression on blasts in relation to genetic aberrancies and survival data of 684 patients. All patients were included in different studies from the HOVON/SAKK Consortium. RESULTS: Markers CD2, CD7, CD11b, CD19, CD22, and CD56 all appeared to be associated with one or more established prognostic genetic aberrancies. In the overall population, differences in univariate survival analyses were observed for CD2, CD11b, and CD22. After correcting these survival differences for currently used risk profile data, only CD11b expression remained of prognostic value for poor overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). CD11b expression turned out to be an independent factor for poor OS and EFS in the subgroup of patients who lacked cytogenetic and molecular aberrancies. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate that associations between immunophenotypic markers and genetic aberrancies interfere with the prognostic properties of immunophenotypic markers. Such may account for most of the previously reported prognostic impact of these markers. Only CD11b expression remained as an independent prognostic marker.

Epub 2017 Jul 29.,"BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative first complete remission (CR1) are unknown. We retrospectively attempted to answer the following question: In AML patients undergoing allo-HCT in MRD-negative CR1, does a history of prior consolidation provide additional prognostic information? METHODS: The inclusion criteria were: (i) Age > 18 years, (ii) AML in CR1 after 1-2 cycles of intensive induction chemotherapy, with or without consolidation, (iii) Allo-HCT between 1/2003 and 4/2016 at our institution, (iv) Available standard-sensitivity 4-color flow cytometry results from a bone marrow aspiration at diagnosis and after completion of all previous chemotherapy within one month prior to HCT, (v) Flow cytometry-based MRD-negative status at the time of HCT. RESULTS: A history of prior consolidation was associated with favorable overall survival (Hazard Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]: 0.59 [0.35-0.99], P = .046), relapse-free survival (0.60 [0.37-0.96], P = .036), and relapse (0.50 [0.27-0.92], P = .025). Analysis of potential sources of bias was unrevealing. CONCLUSIONS: In AML patients undergoing allo-HCT in MRD-negative CR1, a history of prior consolidation was associated with favorable outcomes. If the path to pre-HCT MRD negativity includes consolidation, it may identify patients with improved prognosis following HCT in MRD-negative state. These results warrant validation in larger cohorts.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC5734672,['NIHMS926182'],,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9384-272X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6896-6213']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that FGFR inhibitors significantly suppress leukemia and lymphoma development in vivo, and cell viability in vitro. Since resistance to targeted therapies is a major reason for relapse, we developed FGFR1-overexpressing mouse and human cell lines that are resistant to the specific FGFR inhibitors AZD4547 and BGJ398, as well as non-specific inhibitors, such as ponatinib, TKI258 and E3810. Two mutually exclusive mechanisms for resistance were demonstrated; an activating V561M mutation in the FGFR1 kinase domain and mutational inactivation of PTEN resulting in increased PI3K/AKT activity. Ectopic expression of PTEN in the PTEN-mutant cells resensitizes them to FGFR inhibitors. Treatment of resistant cells with BGJ398, in combination with the BEZ235 PI3K inhibitor, shows an additive effect on growth in vitro and prolongs survival in xenograft models in vivo.

Some antigens detected by immunophenotyping may soon play a significant role in the pathophysiologic, prognostic, and overall survival (OS) rate of AML patients. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library (using PRISMA guidelines). We analyzed 11 studies and 13 antigens, detected through the immunophenotyping of 639 patients. From them, twelve exhibited a negative impact with AML prognosis. The meta-analysis demonstrated a high expression of AML markers, which have been associated with a decrease in survival over 10 months (RR 2.55; IC 95%; 1.49-4.37) and over 20 months (RR 2.46; IC 95%; 1.75-3.45). Knowing that the expression of immunophenotypic markers, which are not used on a routine basis, might be able to influence disease behavior, looks promising. However, they have been associated with a poor prognosis as well as a decrease in survival.

The deregulation of CDK9/P-TEFb has important implications for many cancer types. BAY 1143572 is a novel and highly selective CDK9/P-TEFb inhibitor currently being investigated in phase 1 studies. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of BAY 1143572 in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). As a result of CDK9 inhibition and subsequent inhibition of phosphorylation at serine 2 of the RNAPII CTD, BAY 1143572 decreased c-Myc and Mcl-1 levels in ATL-derived or human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-transformed lines and primary ATL cells tested, leading to their growth inhibition and apoptosis. Median inhibitory concentrations for BAY 1143572 in ATL-derived or HTLV-1-transformed lines (n = 8), primary ATL cells (n = 11), and CD4(+) cells from healthy volunteers (n = 5) were 0.535, 0.30, and 0.36 muM, respectively. Next, NOG mice were used as recipients of tumor cells from an ATL patient. BAY 1143572-treated ATL-bearing mice (once daily 12.5 mg/kg oral application) demonstrated significantly decreased ATL cell infiltration of the liver and bone marrow, as well as decreased human soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in serum (reflecting the ATL tumor burden), compared with untreated mice (n = 8 for both). BAY 1143572-treated ATL-bearing mice demonstrated significantly prolonged survival compared with untreated ATL-bearing mice (n = 7 for both).

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated genomic modification to investigate B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in cell lines of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Three manipulations that altered BCR genes without affecting surface BCR levels showed that BCR signaling differs between the germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype, which is insensitive to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibition by ibrutinib, and the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype. Replacing antigen-binding BCR regions had no effect on BCR signaling in GCB-DLBCL lines, reflecting this subtype's exclusive use of tonic BCR signaling. Conversely, Y188F mutation in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif of CD79A inhibited tonic BCR signaling in GCB-DLBCL lines but did not affect their calcium flux after BCR cross-linking or the proliferation of otherwise-unmodified ABC-DLBCL lines. CD79A-GFP fusion showed BCR clustering or diffuse distribution, respectively, in lines of ABC and GCB subtypes. Tonic BCR signaling acts principally to activate AKT, and forced activation of AKT rescued GCB-DLBCL lines from knockout (KO) of the BCR or 2 mediators of tonic BCR signaling, SYK and CD19. The magnitude and importance of tonic BCR signaling to proliferation and size of GCB-DLBCL lines, shown by the effect of BCR KO, was highly variable; in contrast, pan-AKT KO was uniformly toxic. This discrepancy was explained by finding that BCR KO-induced changes in AKT activity (measured by gene expression, CXCR4 level, and a fluorescent reporter) correlated with changes in proliferation and with baseline BCR surface density. PTEN protein expression and BCR surface density may influence clinical response to therapeutic inhibition of tonic BCR signaling in DLBCL.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029552/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",PMC5813722,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5826-3557', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7311-0065']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) positive for KMT2A/AFF1 (MLL/AF4) translocation, which constitute 60% of all infant ALL cases, have a poor prognosis even after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This poor prognosis is due to one of two factors, either resistance to TNFalpha, which mediates a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response after allo-HSCT, or immune resistance due to upregulated expression of the immune escape factor S100A6. Here, we report an immune stimulatory effect against KMT2A/AFF1-positive ALL cells by treatment with the anti-allergy drug amlexanox, which we found to inhibit S100A6 expression in the presence of TNF-alpha. In KMT2A/AFF1-positive transgenic (Tg) mice, amlexanox enhanced tumor immunity and lowered the penetrance of leukemia development. Similarly, in a NOD/SCID mouse model of human KMT2A/AFF1-positive ALL, amlexanox broadened GVL responses and extended survival. Our findings show how amlexanox degrades the resistance of KMT2A/AFF1-positive ALL to TNFalpha by downregulating S100A6 expression, with immediate potential implications for improving clinical management of KMT2A/AFF1-positive ALL.

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"Purpose: Targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and PI3Kdelta is highly effective for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, deep remissions are uncommon, and drug resistance with single-agent therapy can occur. In vitro studies support the effectiveness of combing PI3Kdelta and BTK inhibitors.Experimental Design: As CLL proliferation and survival depends on the microenvironment, we used murine models to assess the efficacy of the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib combined with the PI3Kdelta inhibitor ACP-319 in vivo We compared single-agent with combination therapy in TCL1-192 cell-injected mice, a model of aggressive CLL.Results: We found significantly larger reductions in tumor burden in the peripheral blood and spleen of combination-treated mice. Although single-agent therapy improved survival compared with control mice by a few days, combination therapy extended survival by over 2 weeks compared with either single agent. The combination reduced tumor proliferation, NF-kappaB signaling, and expression of BCL-xL and MCL-1 more potently than single-agent therapy.Conclusions: The combination of acalabrutinib and ACP-319 was superior to single-agent treatment in a murine CLL model, warranting further investigation of this combination in clinical studies.

Here, high-resolution immunogenetic analysis of B cells from (unrelated) fetal, child, and adult samples, shows that although fetal liver (FL) and bone marrow (FBM) IgM repertoires are equally diversified, FL is the main source of IgM natural immunity during the 2nd trimester. Strikingly, 0.25% of all prenatal clonotypes, comprising 18.7% of the expressed repertoire, are shared with the postnatal samples, consistent with persisting fetal IgM+ B cells being a source of natural IgM repertoire in adult life. Further, the origins of specific stereotypic IgM+ B cell receptors associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, can be traced back to fetal B cell lymphopoiesis, suggesting that persisting fetal B cells can be subject to malignant transformation late in life.

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"BACKGROUND: Internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 are common in acute myeloid leukaemia and are associated with rapid relapse and short overall survival. The clinical benefit of FLT3 inhibitors in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia has been limited by rapid generation of resistance mutations, particularly in codon Asp835 (D835). We aimed to assess the highly selective oral FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: In this phase 1-2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia who either were refractory to induction therapy or had relapsed after achieving remission with previous treatment. Patients were enrolled into one of seven dose-escalation or dose-expansion cohorts assigned to receive once-daily doses of oral gilteritinib (20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 450 mg). Cohort expansion was based on safety and tolerability, FLT3 inhibition in correlative assays, and antileukaemic activity. Although the presence of an FLT3 mutation was not an inclusion criterion, we required ten or more patients with locally confirmed FLT3 mutations (FLT3(mut+)) to be enrolled in expansion cohorts at each dose level. On the basis of emerging findings, we further expanded the 120 mg and 200 mg dose cohorts to include FLT3(mut+) patients only. The primary endpoints were the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib. Safety and tolerability were assessed in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of gilteritinib). Responses were assessed in the full analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who had at least one datapoint post-treatment). Pharmacokinetics were assessed in a subset of the safety analysis set for which sufficient data for concentrations of gilteritinib in plasma were available to enable derivation of one or more pharmacokinetic variables. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02014558, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2013, and Aug 27, 2015, 252 adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia received oral gilteritinib once daily in one of seven dose-escalation (n=23) or dose-expansion (n=229) cohorts. Gilteritinib was well tolerated; the maximum tolerated dose was established as 300 mg/day when two of three patients enrolled in the 450 mg dose-escalation cohort had two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events irrespective of relation to treatment were febrile neutropenia (97 [39%] of 252), anaemia (61 [24%]), thrombocytopenia (33 [13%]), sepsis (28 [11%]), and pneumonia (27 [11%]). Commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (92 [37%] of 252]), anaemia (86 [34%]), fatigue (83 [33%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (65 [26%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (47 [19%]). Serious adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (98 [39%] of 252; five related to treatment), progressive disease (43 [17%]), sepsis (36 [14%]; two related to treatment), pneumonia (27 [11%]), acute renal failure (25 [10%]; five related to treatment), pyrexia (21 [8%]; three related to treatment), bacteraemia (14 [6%]; one related to treatment), and respiratory failure (14 [6%]). 95 people died in the safety analysis set, of which seven deaths were judged possibly or probably related to treatment (pulmonary embolism [200 mg/day], respiratory failure [120 mg/day], haemoptysis [80 mg/day], intracranial haemorrhage [20 mg/day], ventricular fibrillation [120 mg/day], septic shock [80 mg/day], and neutropenia [120 mg/day]). An exposure-related increase in inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was noted with increasing concentrations in plasma of gilteritinib. In-vivo inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation occurred at all dose levels. At least 90% of FLT3 phosphorylation inhibition was seen by day 8 in most patients receiving a daily dose of 80 mg or higher. 100 (40%) of 249 patients in the full analysis set achieved a response, with 19 (8%) achieving complete remission, ten (4%) complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, 46 (18%) complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery, and 25 (10%) partial remission INTERPRETATION: Gilteritinib had a favourable safety profile and showed consistent FLT3 inhibition in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. These findings confirm that FLT3 is a high-value target for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia; based on activity data, gilteritinib at 120 mg/day is being tested in phase 3 trials.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether BP is associated with malignancy. METHOD: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and reference lists of included studies were searched for comparative studies that evaluated the relationship between BP and malignancy. Data were analyzed on the basis of study design: cross-sectional, case control, and cohort. A meta-analysis was performed by using a random effects model to estimate pooled odds ratio. RESULTS: The review included 8 studies. No association between BP and overall cancer was found for any of the study designs. Although a single cohort study reported an association with lymphoid leukemia and kidney and larynx cancer, a pooled analysis of case-control studies did not. A pooled analysis of cross-sectional studies found a significant association between BP and hematologic malignancies. LIMITATIONS: The paucity of well-designed studies hindered the possibility of proving or disproving the BP-cancer association. CONCLUSION: We did not find an association of BP with overall malignancy, but a possible association with hematologic malignancy was observed.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"Neuropathy is a major diabetic complication. While the mechanism of this neuropathy is not well understood, it is believed to result in part from deficient nerve regeneration. Work from our laboratory established that gp130 family of cytokines are induced in animals after axonal injury and are involved in the induction of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) and in the conditioning lesion response. Here, we examine whether a reduction of cytokine signaling occurs in diabetes. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to destroy pancreatic beta cells, leading to chronic hyperglycemia. Mice were injected with either low doses of STZ (5x60mg/kg) or a single high dose (1x200mg/kg) and examined after three or one month, respectively. Both low and high dose STZ treatment resulted in sustained hyperglycemia and functional deficits associated with the presence of both sensory and autonomic neuropathy. Diabetic mice displayed significantly reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and sudomotor function. Furthermore, low and high dose diabetic mice showed significantly reduced tactile touch sensation measured with Von Frey monofilaments. To look at the regenerative and injury-induced responses in diabetic mice, neurons in both superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and the 4th and 5th lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were unilaterally axotomized. Both high and low dose diabetic mice displayed significantly less axonal regeneration in the sciatic nerve, when measured in vivo, 48h after crush injury. Significantly reduced induction of two gp130 cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin-6, occurred in diabetic animals in SCG 6h after injury compared to controls. Injury-induced expression of interleukin-6 was also found to be significantly reduced in the DRG at 6h after injury in low and high dose diabetic mice. These effects were accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a downstream effector of the gp130 signaling pathway. We also found decreased induction of several gp130-dependent RAGs, including galanin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Together, these data suggest a novel mechanism for the decreased response of diabetic sympathetic and sensory neurons to injury.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"Multiple studies have demonstrated that ALDH1A1 is elevated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). As a means to better characterize such cells, we previously developed the fluorescent ALDH1A1 substrate Aldefluor to facilitate HSC identification and isolation. This has proven useful for counting and isolating HSCs from human bone marrow, peripheral blood and cord blood as well as stem cells in other tissues and organisms. Given the high level expression of ALDH1A1, we explored its biology and that of other ALDHs in HSCs and found that ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 were important in metabolizing reactive aldehydes (RAlds) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In murine models, loss of these two isoforms resulted in a variety of effects on HSC biology, increased DNA damage and predisposition to leukemia formation when combined with a genetic driver of HSC proliferation and self-renewal. Loss of ALDH activity may also predispose to marrow failure and AML in Fanconi's anemia (FA). ALDHs also have importance in mediating drug resistance in AML, may be useful in the identification of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and ALDH activity levels may have prognostic significance. Together these findings suggest that further studying ALDH biology in AML and other blood cancers may provide important insights into malignant transformation and may point the way to the development of novel diagnostics and therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Its clinical management remains a challenging therapeutic task both for patient and medical team, given to the therapy-attributable risks for mother and fetus and the connected counseling regarding pregnancy continuation. METHODS: We provided a review of updated literature and a comprehensive description of five maternal/fetal outcomes of AML cases diagnosed concomitantly to pregnancy and treated at our Institution from 2006 to 2012. RESULTS: Median age at AML diagnosis was 32 years (31-39). One diagnosis was performed in first trimester and the patient asked for therapeutic abortion before starting chemotherapy. Three cases were diagnosed in second/third trimester; in one case leukemia was diagnosed concomitantly with intrauterine fetal death, while the remaining two patients continued pregnancy and delivered a healthy baby by cesarean section. In only one of these two cases chemotherapy was performed during pregnancy (at 24 + 5 weeks) and consisted of a combination of daunorubicine and cytarabine. Therapy was well tolerated and daily fetus monitoring was performed. After completion of 30 weeks of gestation a cesarean section was carried out; the newborn had an Apgar score of 5/1'-7/5'-9/10', oxygen therapy was temporarily given and peripheral counts displayed transient mild leukopenia. One patient had diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome rapidly progressed to AML after delivery. Four out of the 5 described women are currently alive and disease-free. Three children were born and long-term follow-up has shown normal growth and development. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of AML occurring during pregnancy is challenging and therapeutic decisions should be taken individually for each patient. Consideration must be given both to the immediate health of mother and fetus and to long-term infant health. Our series confirmed the literature data: fetal toxicity of cytostatic therapy clusters during the first trimester; while chemotherapy can be administered safely during second/third trimester and combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine is recommended for induction.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Pregnancy']",,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",PMC5481954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"BACKGROUND: Although childhood cancer is a leading cause of childhood mortality in the US, evidence regarding the etiology is lacking. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between benzene, a known carcinogen, and childhood acute leukemia. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study including cases diagnosed with acute leukemia between 1997 and 2012 (n = 307) from the Oklahoma Central Cancer Registry and controls matched on week of birth from birth certificates (n = 1013). We used conditional logistic regression to evaluate the association between benzene, measured with the 2005 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) at census tract of the birth residence, and childhood acute leukemia. RESULTS: We observed no differences in benzene exposure overall between cases and controls. However, when stratified by year of birth, cases born from 2005 to 2010 had a three-fold increased unadjusted odds of elevated exposure compared to controls born in this same time period (4th Quartile OR: 3.53, 95% CI: 1.35, 9.27). Furthermore, the estimates for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were stronger than those with acute lymphoid leukemia, though not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not observe an association between benzene and childhood leukemia overall, our results suggest that acute leukemia is associated with increased benzene exposure among more recent births, and children with AML may have increased benzene exposure at birth. Using the NATA estimates allowed us to assess a specific pollutant at the census tract level, providing an advantage over monitor or point source data. Our study, however, cannot rule out the possibility that benzene may be a marker of other traffic-related exposures and temporal misclassification may explain the lack of an association among earlier births.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved outcomes but many patients still suffer relapse and novel therapeutic agents are needed. KPC34 is an orally available, novel phospholipid conjugate of gemcitabine, rationally designed to overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance, inhibit the classical and novel isoforms of protein kinase C, is able to cross the blood brain barrier and is orally bioavailable. KPC34 had an IC50 in the nanomolar range against multiple ALL cell lines tested but was lowest for Ph+ lines. In mice bearing either naive or resistant Ph+ ALL, KPC34 treatment resulted in significantly improved survival compared to cytarabine and gemcitabine. Treatment with KPC34 and doxorubicin was more effective than doxorubicin and cytarabine. Mice with recurrence of their ALL after initial treatment with cytarabine and doxorubicin saw dramatic improvements in hind limb paralysis after treatment with KPC34 demonstrating activity against established CNS disease. Consistent with this KPC34 was better than gemcitabine at reducing CNS leukemic burden.

Epub 2017 Jun 21.,"Two frequently used tools to acquire high- resolution images of cells are scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The former provides a nanometer resolution view of cellular features rapidly and with high throughput, while the latter enables visualizing hydrated and living cells. In current practice, these images are viewed by eye to determine cellular status, e.g., activated versus resting. Automatic and quantitative data analysis is lacking. This paper develops an algorithm of pattern recognition that works very effectively for AFM and SEM images. Using rat basophilic leukemia cells, our approach creates a support vector machine to automatically classify resting and activated cells. Ten-fold cross-validation with cells that are known to be activated or resting gives a good estimate of the generalized classification results. The pattern recognition of AFM images achieves 100% accuracy, while SEM reaches 95.4% for our images as well as images published in prior literature. This outcome suggests that our methodology could become an important and frequently used tool for researchers utilizing AFM and SEM for structural characterization as well as determining cellular signaling status and function.",,,,['R21 CA176850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC5633003,['NIHMS907899'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"Purpose Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a CD33-targeted immunoconjugate, is a re-emerging therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CD33 single nucleotide polymorphism rs12459419 C>T in the splice enhancer region regulates the expression of an alternatively spliced CD33 isoform lacking exon2 (D2-CD33), thus eliminating the CD33 IgV domain, which is the antibody-binding site for GO, as well as diagnostic immunophenotypic panels. We aimed to determine the impact of the genotype of this splicing polymorphism in patients with AML treated with GO-containing chemotherapy. Patients and Methods CD33 splicing single nucleotide polymorphism was evaluated in newly diagnosed patients with AML randomly assigned to receive standard five-course chemotherapy alone (No-GO arm, n = 408) or chemotherapy with the addition of two doses of GO once during induction and once during intensification (GO arm, n = 408) as per the Children's Oncology Group AAML0531 trial. Results The rs12459419 genotype was CC in 415 patients (51%), CT in 316 patients (39%), and TT in 85 patients (10%), with a minor allele frequency of 30%. The T allele was significantly associated with higher levels of D2-CD33 transcript ( P < 1.0E(-6)) and with lower diagnostic leukemic cell surface CD33 intensity ( P < 1.0E(-6)). Patients with the CC genotype had significantly lower relapse risk in the GO arm than in the No-GO arm (26% v 49%; P < .001). However, in patients with the CT or TT genotype, exposure to GO did not influence relapse risk (39% v 40%; P = .85). Disease-free survival was higher in patients with the CC genotype in the GO arm than in the No-GO arm (65% v 46%, respectively; P = .004), but this benefit of GO addition was not seen in patients with the CT or TT genotype. Conclusion Our results suggest that patients with the CC genotype for rs12459419 have a substantial response to GO, making this a potential biomarker for the selection of patients with a likelihood of significant response to GO.",,,,"['R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",PMC5549451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"Purpose T-cell-replete HLA-haploidentical donor hematopoietic transplantation using post-transplant cyclophosphamide was originally described using bone marrow (BM). With increasing use of mobilized peripheral blood (PB), we compared transplant outcomes after PB and BM transplants. Patients and Methods A total of 681 patients with hematologic malignancy who underwent transplantation in the United States between 2009 and 2014 received BM (n = 481) or PB (n = 190) grafts. Cox regression models were built to examine differences in transplant outcomes by graft type, adjusting for patient, disease, and transplant characteristics. Results Hematopoietic recovery was similar after transplantation of BM and PB (28-day neutrophil recovery, 88% v 93%, P = .07; 100-day platelet recovery, 88% v 85%, P = .33). Risks of grade 2 to 4 acute (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; P < .001) and chronic (HR, 0.35; P < .001) graft-versus-host disease were lower with transplantation of BM compared with PB. There were no significant differences in overall survival by graft type (HR, 0.99; P = .98), with rates of 54% and 57% at 2 years after transplantation of BM and PB, respectively. There were no differences in nonrelapse mortality risks (HR, 0.92; P = .74) but relapse risks were higher after transplantation of BM (HR, 1.49; P = .009). Additional exploration confirmed that the higher relapse risks after transplantation of BM were limited to patients with leukemia (HR, 1.73; P = .002) and not lymphoma (HR, 0.87; P = .64). Conclusion PB and BM grafts are suitable for haploidentical transplantation with the post-transplant cyclophosphamide approach but with differing patterns of treatment failure.

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,"INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic changes resulting from aberrant methylation patterns are a recurrent observation in hematologic malignancies. Hypomethylating agents have a well-established role in the management of patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. In addition to the direct effects of hypomethylating agents on cancer cells, there are several lines of evidence indicating a role for immune-mediated anti-tumor benefits from hypomethylating therapy. Areas covered: We reviewed the clinical and basic science literature for the effects of hypomethylating agents, including the most commonly utilized therapeutics azacitidine and decitabine, on immune cell subsets. We summarized the effects of hypomethylating agents on the frequency and function of natural killer cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. In particular, we highlight the effects of hypomethylating agents on expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors, leukemia-associated antigens, and endogenous retroviral elements. Expert commentary: In vitro and ex vivo studies indicate mixed effects on the function of natural killer, dendritic cells and T cells following treatment with hypomethylating agents. Clinical correlates of immune function have suggested that hypomethylating agents have immunomodulatory functions with the potential to synergize with immune checkpoint therapy for the treatment of hematologic malignancy, and has become an active area of clinical research.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*NK cells', '*T-cells', '*azacitidine', '*decitabine', '*hypomethylating agents', '*immune effects', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",['ZIA HL006163-04/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",PMC6071309,['NIHMS1500836'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6189-8067'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report a case of an elderly woman with a fulminant course, who at onset presented with clinical and pathological features mimicking erythema multiforme (EM) and treated with cyclosporine that led to rapid deterioration with fatal outcome 6 months after disease onset. Histopathology showed a lichenoid, epidermotropic and nodular, angiocentric, dermal and subcutaneous infiltrate of sF1, CD8+, CD45RA+ small to medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells, which strongly expressed cytotoxic markers. Monoclonal T-cell-gamma receptor was clonally rearranged and array-CGH showed numerous chromosomal imbalances. This case evidences the clinical, pathological and therapeutic challenges involved in this tumor. The first biopsy showed an interface dermatitis-like pattern, revealing the deceptive features that early cutaneous infiltrates of this aggressive lymphoma may have. A high suspicion for aggressive CTCL and a low threshold for repeat biopsies should be maintained when faced with rapidly progressing and/or ulcerative EM-like lesions, especially if immunomodulatory therapy is being considered.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Most prior studies have compared cases to national reference data derived from previous birth cohorts. Our objective was to determine the association of height-for-age Z score (HAZ) at time of diagnosis with the odds ratio (OR) of ALL in a case-control study (N=498) with a contemporaneous population of age-matched, sex-matched, and ethnicity-matched controls. We hypothesized that cases would have greater mean HAZ at time of diagnosis/interview, after adjustment for weight-for-age (WAZ) and weight-for-height (WHZ). HAZ was not associated with ALL. For each 1 SD increase in WAZ the OR of ALL was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.99). The OR of ALL was increased among children who had either a WAZ </=-2 (OR, 5.10; 95% CI, 1.85-16.75) or WHZ of </=-2 (OR, 5.27; 95% CI, 1.65-23.61).

Four years prior, the patient had a melanoma removed from his right shoulder along with an ipsilateral right axillary sentinel lymph sampling. Computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for metastatic disease at that time. The patient did not undergo completion axillary node dissection and was lost to follow-up. The patient was originally from Australia, did not tan but reported multiple sunburns before age 18. He was of Irish ancestry. He denied weight gain, fever, fatigue, anorexia, or night sweats. The patient had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, melanoma, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. His surgical history included an appendectomy and a facial laceration repair. His brother died at 16 years old from leukemia and his mother died from colon cancer. He consumed 3 alcoholic beverages per day and denied tobacco or illicit drug use. On physical exam, the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 73 beats / minute, blood pressure of 121 / 59 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 / min. He appeared to be healthy and in no apparent distress. Cardiovascular, respiratory, breast, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological exam were unremarkable. His right axillary lymph node exam revealed a firm mass roughly 2.5 cm tall by 1.5 cm wide. This mass was biopsied and findings were consistent with metastatic melanoma. CT scan revealed small volume mediastinal adenopathy and a 4.5 cm right axillary mass. There was a 4.7 cm lesion within the anterior left lower lobe of the liver and periportal node conglomerate measuring 3.9 cm consistent with metastatic disease (Figure 1). He was negative for the BRAF V600E mutation. The patient was consented for treatment with combination immune checkpoint inhibition with ipilimumab and nivolumab. After two cycles the patient showed good response, but temporarily stopped treatment after complications related to a ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. He developed mild pneumonitis felt to be related to nivolumab, and recovered after a short course of glucocorticosteroids. Restaging CT scans were ordered after two cycles of therapy (Figure 2), which showed decrease in the size of the axillary and hepatic metastases. At six months, CT scans showed continued durable response (Figure 3).",,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '31YO63LBSN (Nivolumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a FLT3 mutation have poor outcomes. We conducted a phase 3 trial to determine whether the addition of midostaurin - an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that is active in patients with a FLT3 mutation - to standard chemotherapy would prolong overall survival in this population. METHODS: We screened 3277 patients, 18 to 59 years of age, who had newly diagnosed AML for FLT3 mutations. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard chemotherapy (induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine and consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine) plus either midostaurin or placebo; those who were in remission after consolidation therapy entered a maintenance phase in which they received either midostaurin or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to subtype of FLT3 mutation: point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) or internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation with either a high ratio (>0.7) or a low ratio (0.05 to 0.7) of mutant to wild-type alleles (ITD [high] and ITD [low], respectively). Allogeneic transplantation was allowed. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients underwent randomization; 360 were assigned to the midostaurin group, and 357 to the placebo group. The FLT3 subtype was ITD (high) in 214 patients, ITD (low) in 341 patients, and TKD in 162 patients. The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to age, race, FLT3 subtype, cytogenetic risk, and blood counts but not with respect to sex (51.7% in the midostaurin group vs. 59.4% in the placebo group were women, P=0.04). Overall survival was significantly longer in the midostaurin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.78; one-sided P=0.009), as was event-free survival (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.78; one-sided P=0.002). In both the primary analysis and an analysis in which data for patients who underwent transplantation were censored, the benefit of midostaurin was consistent across all FLT3 subtypes. The rate of severe adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin to standard chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall and event-free survival among patients with AML and a FLT3 mutation.

Epub 2017 Jul 5.,"Dasatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but known complication. The mainstay of treatment is cessation of Dasatinib, and while clinical improvement is rapid, complete hemodynamic resolution of pulmonary hypertension (PH) still remains exceedingly uncommon. We present a case of Dasatinib-induced PAH in a woman with chronic myeloid leukemia, who demonstrated rapid and complete clinical and hemodynamic resolution following treatment with combination pulmonary vasodilator therapy using an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor.

However, its apoptotic mechanisms are still unclear, especially in leukemic cells. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of 4-NRC and its cell death pathways in p53-null K562 leukemic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of 4-NRC (4.17-534.5 muM) over 24 h of exposure was evaluated by MTT assay. 4-NRC-induced apoptosis in K562 cells was investigated by phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, cell cycle, sub-G1, mitochondrial evaluation, cytochrome c, cyclin D1 and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and caspase activity analysis. RESULTS: IC50 values obtained were 11.40, 27.31, 15.93 and 15.70 muM for lymphocytes, K562, HL-60 and Jurkat cells, respectively. In K562 cells, 4-NRC (27 muM) promoted apoptosis as verified by cellular morphological changes, a significant increase in PS externalization and sub-G1 cells. Moreover, it significantly arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase due to a reduction in cyclin D1 expression. These effects of 4-NRC also significantly promoted a reduction in mitochondrial activity and membrane depolarization, accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c and ROS overproduction. Additionally, it triggered an increase in caspases -3/7, -8 and -9 activities. When the cells were pretreated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine ROS scavenger, 4-NRC-induced apoptosis was partially blocked, which suggests that it exerts cytotoxicity though not exclusively through ROS-mediated mechanisms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: 4-NRC has antileukemic properties, inducing apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms with cyclin D1 inhibition. Given that emerging treatment concepts include novel combinations of well-known agents, 4-NRC could offer a promising alternative for chemotherapeutic combinations to maximize tumour suppression.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'cell cycle arrest', 'leukaemia', 'mitochondria', 'multidrug resistance']",,"['0 (4-nerolidylcatechol)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Catechols)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",PMC6130688,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Cox regression analyses, bone marrow (BM) DNMT3A(mut) transcript levels (log10-transformed continuous variable) were not associated with the rate of relapse or death. DNMT3A(mut) transcript levels were significantly higher in BM than in blood after induction I (P=0.01), induction II (P=0.05), consolidation I (P=0.004) and consolidation II (P=0.008). With regard to the clinically relevant MRD time points, after two cycles of induction and at the end of therapy, DNMT3A(mut) transcript levels had no impact on the end point remission duration and overall survival.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially acute megakaryocytic leukemia, is reported with high cure rates presenting 80%-100% event-free survivals (EFSs); however, acute lymphoid leukemia indicates a worse prognosis in DS patients compared to non-DS children. Complex rearrangements are responsible for poor-to-very poor prognosis in all cases, irrespective of genetic predisposition or type of hematopoietic subunits affected. We report a 2-year-old female DS diagnosed with acute erythroleukemia (French-American-British: AML-M6) with highly complex chromosomal rearrangements in the bone marrow with 39 chromosomes.

Epub 2017 Jul 12.,"Retroviruses are obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells. After reverse transcription, the viral DNA contained in the preintegration complex is delivered to the nucleus of the host cell, where it integrates. Before reaching the nucleus, the incoming particle and the preintegration complex must travel throughout the cytoplasm. Likewise, the newly synthesized viral proteins and viral particles must transit the cytoplasm during exit. The cytoplasm is a crowded environment, and simple diffusion is difficult. Therefore, viruses have evolved to utilize the cellular mechanisms of movement through the cytoplasm, where microtubules are the roads, and the ATP-dependent motors dynein and kinesin are the vehicles for retrograde and anterograde trafficking. This review will focus on how different retroviruses (Mazon-Pfizer monkey virus, prototype foamy virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and murine leukemia virus) have subjugated the microtubule-associated motor proteins for viral replication. Although there have been advances in our understanding of how retroviruses move along microtubules, the strategies are different among them. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms used by each retrovirus to functionally subvert microtubule motor proteins will provide important clues in the design of new antiretroviral drugs that can specifically disrupt intracellular viral trafficking.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9935-0451'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare nilotinib concentrations obtained by venous blood sampling and dried blood spot (DBS) in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It was investigated how to predict nilotinib plasma levels on the basis of DBS. METHODS: Forty duplicate DBS and venous blood samples were collected from 20 patients. Capillary blood was obtained by finger prick and spotted on DMPK-C Whatman sampling paper, simultaneously with venous blood sampling. Plasma concentrations were predicted from DBS concentrations using three methods: (1) individual and (2) mean haematocrit correction and (3) the bias between plasma and DBS concentrations. Results were compared using Deming regression and Bland-Altman analysis. KEY FINDINGS: Nilotinib plasma concentrations ranged from 376 to 2663 mug/l. DBS concentrations ranged from 144 to 1518 mug/l. The slope was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.61) with an intercept of -41.68 mug/l (95% CI, -93.78 to 10.42). Mean differences between calculated and measured plasma concentrations were -14.3% (method 1), -14.0% (method 2) and -0.6% (method 3); differences were within 20% of the mean in 73%, 85% and 80% of the samples, respectively. The slopes were respectively 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.06), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.03) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma concentrations of nilotinib could be predicted on the basis of DBS.

While allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a potentially curative approach, high relapse, morbidity, and mortality rates necessitate the development of alternative therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors unmask tumoral immune tolerance and have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant hematologic and solid malignancies. The rationale for the investigation of those agents in AML and MDS is supported by an observed increased expression of programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) and ligand 1 (PD-L1) in the hematopoietic microenvironment of AML and MDS, and its association with low TP53 and a poor prognosis. Early clinical experience in combination with a hypomethylating agent has shown encouraging responses; however, larger clinical trials are needed to determine the role of checkpoint inhibition in myeloid malignancies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Immunotherapy', 'MDS', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'PD-1', 'PD-L1']",,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6443-6239'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the literature reporting three recurrent GATA2 germline (g) mutations (gT354M, gR396Q and gR398W) revealed different phenotype tendencies. Although all three mutants differentially predispose to myeloid malignancies, there was no difference in leukemia-free survival for GATA2 patients. Despite intense interest, the molecular pathogenesis of GATA2 mutation is poorly understood. We functionally characterized a GATA2 mutant allelic series representing major disease phenotypes caused by germline and somatic (s) mutations in zinc finger 2 (ZF2). All GATA2 mutants, except for sL359V, displayed reduced DNA-binding affinity and transactivation compared with wild type (WT), which could be attributed to mutations of arginines critical for DNA binding or amino acids required for ZF2 domain structural integrity. Two GATA2 mutants (gT354M and gC373R) bound the key hematopoietic differentiation factor PU.1 more strongly than WT potentially perturbing differentiation via sequestration of PU.1. Unlike WT, all mutants failed to suppress colony formation and some mutants skewed cell fate to granulocytes, consistent with the monocytopenia phenotype seen in GATA2-related immunodeficiency disorders. These findings implicate perturbations of GATA2 function shaping the course of development of myeloid malignancy subtypes and strengthen complete or nearly complete haploinsufficiency for predisposition to lymphedema.",,,,,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",PMC5770593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 23.,"The understanding of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) emergence is important to generate HSCs from pluripotent precursors. However, integrated signaling network that regulates the niche of nascent HSCs remains unclear. Herein, we uncovered a novel role of TGF-beta1 in the metabolic niche of HSC emergence using the tgf-beta1b(-/-) zebrafish. Our findings first showed that Tgf-beta1 transcripts were enriched in the nascent HSCs. Loss of tgf-beta1b caused a decrease of nascent HSCs within the aorta-gonad-mesonephros. Moreover, tgf-beta1b(+) cells were runx1(+) HSCs and underwent an endothelial-to-hematopoietic-transition process. Although the autocrine of Tgf-beta1 in HSCs rather than endothelial cells was highly demanded to regulate HSC generation, we found that tgf-beta1b promoted HSC emergence through the endothelial c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing data showed that tgf-beta1b/c-Jun targeted g6pc3 of FoxO signaling to promote gluconeogenesis and maintain a high glucose level in the niche. Furthermore, loss of tgf-beta1b increased the endoplasmic-reticulum stress and oxidative stress by disturbing metabolic homeostasis. Adding a low dose of TGF-beta1 protein could promote the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells towards HSCs in vitro. Altogether, our study provided insights into a new feature of TGF-beta1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism and nascent HSC niche, which may contribute to therapies of hematological malignancies.",,,,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we applied an integrative network biology approach to molecular and clinical data measured from 450 patients with newly diagnosed MM from the MMRF (Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation) CoMMpass study. A novel network model of myeloma (MMNet) was constructed, revealing complex molecular disease patterns and novel associations between clinical traits and genomic markers. Genomic alterations and groups of coexpressed genes correlate with disease stage, tumor clonality and early progression. We validated CDC42BPA and CLEC11A as novel regulators and candidate therapeutic targets of MMSET-related myeloma. We then used MMNet to discover novel genes associated with high-risk myeloma and identified a novel four-gene prognostic signature. We identified new patient classes defined by network features and enriched for clinically relevant genetic events, pathways and deregulated genes. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of deep sequencing techniques to detect relevant structural rearrangements, providing evidence that encourages wider use of such technologies in clinical practice. An integrative network analysis of CoMMpass data identified new insights into multiple myeloma disease biology and provided improved molecular features for diagnosing and stratifying patients, as well as additional molecular targets for therapeutic alternatives.",,,,"['S10 OD018522/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA196521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used our prospective data set to answer a clinically important question: who is the best donor for a person with acute leukaemia transplanted in first complete remission. Patients were randomly divided into training (n=611) and validation (n=588) sets. A total of 1199 consecutive subjects received a transplant from an HLA-haplotype-matched relative using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and anti-thymocyte globulin (n=685) or an HLA-identical sibling (n=514); 3-year leukaemia-free survivals (LFSs) were 75 and 74% (P=0.95), respectively. The multivariate model identified three major risk factors for transplant-related mortality (TRM): older donor/recipient age, female-to-male transplants and donor-recipient ABO major-mismatch transplants. A risk score was developed based on these three features. TRMs were 8%, 15% and 31% for subjects with scores of 0-1, 2 and 3, respectively, (P<0.001). Three-year LFSs were 78%, 74% and 58%, respectively, (P=0.003). The risk score was validated in an independent cohort.

Epub 2017 Jun 22.,"The only cytogenetic aberration defining a myelodysplastic syndrome subtype is the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, which, along with morphological features, leads to the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5. These patients show a good prognosis and respond to treatment such as lenalidomide, but some cases progress to acute myeloid leukemia; however, the molecular mutation pattern is rarely characterized. Therefore, we investigated a large cohort of 123 myelodysplastic syndrome patients with isolated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, diagnosed following the World Health Organization classifications 2008 and 2016, by sequencing 27 genes. A great proportion of patients showed no or only one mutation. Only seven genes showed mutation frequencies >5% (SF3B1, DNMT3A, TP53, TET2, CSNK1A1, ASXL1, JAK2). However, the pattern of recurrently mutated genes was comparable to other myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes by comparison to a reference cohort, except that of TP53 which was significantly more often mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5. As expected, SF3B1 was frequently mutated and correlated with ring sider-oblasts, while JAK2 mutations correlated with elevated platelet counts. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations led to significantly worse prognosis within cases with isolated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, but showed a comparable outcome to other myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes with SF3B1 mutation. However, addressing genetic stability in follow-up cases might suggest different genetic mechanisms for progression to secondary acute myeloid leukemia compared to overall myelodysplastic syndrome patients.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,PMC5685225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We video-recorded 66 follow-up consultations between 10 pediatricians and 66 adolescent survivors of leukemia, lymphoma or stem-cell transplantations. In transcripts of the recordings, we identified utterances coded as both 1) expressions of negative emotions (VR-CoDES), and 2) late effect-related discussions. Principles of thematic content analysis were used to investigate associations between the two. RESULTS: Of the 66 video-recorded consultations, 22 consultations contained 56 (49%) utterances coded as both emotional concerns and discussions of potential late effects. Negative emotions were most commonly associated with late effects such as fatigue (""I'm struggling with not having energy""), psychosocial distress (""When I touch this (scar) I become nauseous""), pain (""I'm wondering how long I am going to have this pain?""), and treatment-related effects on physical appearance (""Am I growing?""). CONCLUSIONS: Negative emotions expressed by adolescent cancer survivors during follow-up consultations were frequently associated with potential late effects. These late effects were not the medically most serious ones, but reflected issues affecting the adolescents' daily life. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Eliciting and exploring patients' emotional concerns serve as means to obtain clinically relevant information regarding potential late effect and to provide emotional support.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: The clinical data including clinical manifestations, laboratorial tests, histopathologicical examination, immunohistochemistry and clinical prognosis of 10 patients with myeloid sarcoma were analyzed retrospectively. Among 10 patients, 5 male and 5 female, aged 23 to 71 years old (median = 36 years). RESULTS: 2 cases of myeloid sarcoma were secondary from chronic myeloid leukemia, and 1 cases of myeloid sarcoma occurred after the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to acute myeloid leukemia, and the others lacked the anamnesis of malignancies. The neoplasms occurred at bone, brain, skin, breast, epididymis, uterine cervix, small intestine, ovary and lymph nodes. Microscopically, the tumor cells were round or oval, which infiltrated diffusely or arranged in single-file. The cytoplasm was scarce and immature eosinophils were scattered. The nuclei were round, oval or focally irregular, and the mitosis was visible. The neoplasms were positive for MPO, CD34, CD43, CD45, CD99 and CD117 by immunohistochemical staining. 4 patients progressed into acute myeloid leukemia from 2 to 10 months after the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. All of them achieved complete remission after inductive chemotherapy, but 3 patients relapsed from 3 to 12 months after remission and only survived for 14 to 23 months. 4 patients were treated by using chemotherapy before bone marrow abnormality, and with the disease-free survival for 1 to 48 months. CONCLUSION: Myeloid sarcoma needs to be distinguished from lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms and so on.

METHODS: HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells were co-cultured with human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cell (HUCMSC), and the model was treated with G-CSF, AMD3100 and their combination. The cell viability and cell cycle were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), the apoptosis and the cell-cycle analysis were assessed by flow cytometry with the Annexin V/PI double staining. The expression of surface CXCR4 protein and total CXCR4 protein of leukemic cells were detected by flow cytometry and Western blot respectively. RESULTS: HUCMSC could decrease the viability of HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells, as well as the percentage of apoptotic cells, they could also increase the number of G0/G1 cells, while G-CSF and AMD3100 could reduce the proliferation of HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells in HUCMSC co-culture model, destructed the anti-apoptotic effect of HUCMSC on HL-60 cells and Jurkat cells, and the combination of 2 drugs resulted in a synergistic effect. The G-CSF could reduce the expression of surface CXCR4 protein and total CXCR4 protein in leukemic cells, while AMD3100 could only decrease the expression of surface CXCR4 protein of leukemia cell membrane, having no effect on the expression of CXCR4 protein in cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: Human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells can inhibit the proliferation and apoptosis of acute leukemia cells and increase the number of G0/G1 phase cells in leukemic cells. The AMD3100 can decrease the expression of surface CXCR4 protein in leukemia cells, G-CSF can decrease expression of total CXCR4 protein as well as membrane CXCR4 protein. Both of them can block the CXCL12/CXCR4 signal axis, weakening the relationship between leukemia cells and microenvironment. And on the basic of HUCMSC influenced leukemia cells' growth and proliferation, the cell viability will be weakened, its apoptosis will be promoted, and the percentage of G0/G1 phase cells in leukemia cells will be decreased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 51 AL patients underwent NST were analyzed retrospectively in Department of Hematology of Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences from January 2011 to December 2015. All AL patients achieved the morphologic complete remission of bone marrow before transplantation. The bone marrow samples were collected for monitoring of MRD within 35 days before transplant, every month till 3 months after transplant, every 3 months till 24 months after transplant, and then every 6 months after 2 years of transplant. According to the MRD cutoff value of 0.2%, the AL patients were divided into high level MRD group (18 cases) which was defined as MRD>/=0.2% after transplantantion at least for 1 time, and low level MRD group (33 cases) which was defined as MRD<0.2% after transplant all the time. 2 year cumulative relapse rate in 2 groups were compared. RESULTS: Two-year relapse rates were 6.1% and 50% in low-level MRD group and high-level MRD group post NST(P=0.001)respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that the risk of relapse in high level MRD group was 5.84 times of low level MRD group(P=0.036). MRD>/=0.2% post transplant was an independent risk factor for leukemia relapse post NST. The mortality rate was 81.8% and 46.3%(P<0.05) in relapse and non-relapse groups respectively. CONCLUSION: Dynamically monitoring MRD by FCM is a crucial tool for early relapse estimation of acute leukemia in adult patients after allogeneic nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. MRD>/=0.2% after transplant can be used as a early valuable evidence for predicting relapse and guiding active medical intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph(-) ALL patinets with bone marrow blast ratio <0.075 who achieved CR and finally achieved CR after induction chemotherapy for 4 weeks acconnted for 89 (85.6%) and 99(95.2%) respectively, which were significantly higher than those in Ph(-) ALL patients with bone marrow blast ratio>/=0.075, [29(42.6%) and 52 (76.5%)](P<0.05). In addition, the influencing factor clinically reducing the OS and DFS rate of patients and enhancing the ralapse rate of patients were mainly chemotherapy, the failure of induction chemotherapy (patients did not achieve CR after induction therapy for 4 weeks), the bone marrow blast ratio>/=0.075 after induction treatment for 2 weeks, and CNSL at diagnosis and so on, while the enhaced WBC count at diagnosis was poor factor affecting the DFS rate of patients. CONCLUSION: After induction chemotherapy for 2 weeks, the elevated bone marrow blast ratio in Ph(-) ALL patients will be infavourable to CR, and the overall prognosis is poor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The HL-60/ADR cells were divided into 4 groups: control group, adriamycin (ADR)-treated group, resveratrol(Res)-treated group and ADR+Res-treated group. The inhibitory rate of cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 method. The auto-fluorescence intensity of intracellular ADR and the apoptotic rate of HL-60/ADR cells were detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of multidrug-resistance associated protein-1(MRP1), anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 and pro-apoptotic gene BAX were analyzed by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. The protein expression levels of MRP1, BCL-2 and BAX were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The maximal inhibition rates of cell proliferation were 44%, 61%, 76% and 81%, respectively in different concentration of Res (25, 50, 100, 200 micromol/L) and with concentration-dependent manner(r=0.876, P<0.05). Compared with ADR group (IC50: 8.534+/-1.111 micromol/L), the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of HL-60/ADR cells [(1.591+/-0.373) micromol/L] decreased significantly in ADR+Res group(P<0.05). The auto-fluorescence intensity of ADR in HL-60/ADR cells of ADR+Res group increased significantly (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of HL-60/ADR cells in Res or ADR+Res group increased significantly (P<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of MRP1 and Bcl-2 in Res or ADR+Res groups decreased and BAX increased significantly (P<0.05). The protein expression levels of MRP1 and BCL-2 were decreased, BAX increased significantly in Res or ADR+Res group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Resveratrol shows the effect of reversing the drug resisitance of HL-60/ADR cells in acute myeloid leukemia, possibly via promoting the apoptosis of HL-60/ADR cells and inhibiting the expression of MRP1, which may be related with the inhibition of BCL-2 expression and the promotion of BAX expression.",,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three hundred and eighty cases of children's B-ALL from Augest 2008 to January 2013 in our hospital were enrolled in this study. MRD levels were detected at day 15, day 33 and week 12 after initial chemotherapy. The event-free survival(EFS) and overall survival (OS) were measured on the basis of MRD levels at different stages of chemotherapy and were compared by Kaplan Meier analyses. RESULTS: The patient's age, initial white blood cell count, chromosome, MLL, BCR/ABL, pretreatment reaction, bone marrow MRD at days 33 were closely related with the 5-year EFS rate. Multiparameter flow cytometry showed the marked MRD and unmarked MRD were not significantly different between their 5-year EFS rate(P>0.05), and the every immune phenotype was also no significantly different between the 5-year EFS rate(P>0.05).

The 5-year EFS rates at the MRD<10(-4)(negative), 10(-4)-10(-3), 10(-3)-10(-2) and >/=10(-2) at day 33 were 86.6+/-2.7%, 77.5+/-4.9%, 70.1+/-8.0%, and 44.8+/-9.9%(P<0.01) with significant difference respectively; the 5-year OS rate was 89.5+/-2.7%, 80+/-4.9%, 76.0+/-7.8%, and 53.2+/-10.1% with statistically significant difference(P<0. 01). CONCLUSION: The MRD>/=10(-2) at day 33 is a high risk factor for significant reduction of the 5-year EFS rate and the 5-year OS rate of children with B-ALL.

The relationship between clinical characteristics and curative effect was analyzed. The univariate and multivariate analyses related with the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were conducted by using the method of COX regression analysis. RESULTS: Forty-four patients obtained complete remission (CR) in all 61 cases. The total CR rate was 72.13%. Age of onset, WBC count at first visit, CNS involvement or not, status of myeloid antigen expression and Ph chromosome condition were the important factors affecting the CR rate (P<0.05). The 2 years OS rate of all the 61 cases was 28.13%, the median OS time was 11 months (95% CI 9.58-12.42). The 2 years OS rate and DFS rate of the 44 patients in CR were 39.57% and 34.29% respectively. As showed by univariate analysis, the age of onset, WBC count at first visit, whether achieved CR or not after induction chemotherapy, and whether accepted consolidation therapy or allo-HSCT therapy after CR were factors affecting the prognosis of adult ALL patients. The result of multivariate analysis showed that the older age (P=0.001), induction chemotherapy did not achieve CR (P=0.018) and patients did not received consolidation after CR(P=0.005) , all these were independent risk factors for DFS. CONCLUSION: The CR rate after induction chemotherapy is high in adult ALL patients, but the OS rate is low.

METHODS: The autophagy activity of HL-60 cells after down-regulation of NS expression was detected with acidine orange staining, Western blot and transmission electron mcrioscope technique. RESULTS: The expression level of NS in test groups was lower than that in blank control and negative control groups after HL-60 cells were readily transinfected by lentivirus. The result of acidine orange staining showed that the number of acid vesicular organelle in test groups(22.4+/-0.76)% was higher than that in blank control groups(3.1+/-0.28)% and negative control groups(6.2+/-0.64)% (P<0.05). Western blot showed that the ratio of LC3II/LC3I in test groups(1.537+/-0.072) was higher than that in blank control and negative control groups (1.010+/-0.039) and (0.608+/-0.008). The result of transmission electron mcrioscopy also showed that the number of autophagosomes in test group(8.7+/-3.1) was higher than that in the blank control and negative control groups(4.2+/-1.2) and (2.3+/-0.5). CONCLUSION: Autophagy activty can be enhanced after the level of NS was down regulated.

METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were extracted from 5 APL patients and 5 sex- and age- matched patients with iron deficiency anemia as controls. The cells were cultured in vitro for 48 h, then MP-rich culture medium and MP-free culture medium were harvested and MP was further obtained from certain volume of MP-rich culture medium. Subsequently, TF expression on MP was measured by ELISA. PCA of MP-rich culture medium or MP-free culture medium was assessed with thrombin generation assay. The role of TF on MP-related PCA was evaluated using anti-human TF antibody. In addition, APL cells were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide (ATO) or daunorubicin (DNR) for 48 h, then MP-rich culture medium were harvested and the PCA was determined. RESULTS: No TF expression was found in the MP released from bone marrow MNC in control group, whereas the obvious TF expression was found in the MP originated from BMMNC of APL. MP from both APL and control BM-MNC had obvious PCA. However, compared with the MP derived from control MNC, the MP from APL BM-MNC induced significantly higher PCA. TF played a crucial role in the PCA of APL BM-MNC derived MP, while played no role in that of MP from control MNCs. DNR-treating APL BM-MNC resulted in an increase in the PCA of MP, whereas ATO or ATRA exposure lead to exactly the opposite results. CONCLUSION: MP derived from APL BM-MNC posseses obvious PCA. TF plays a crucial role in the MP-related PCA.

The therapeutic efficacy was observed by means of remission rate, relapse rate, relapse-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: The medians of white blood cells, granulocyte, hemoglobin and platelet were 3.04x10(9)/L, 0.67x10(9)/L, 66 g/L, and 45x10(9)/L,respectively. Nucleated red blood cells were found in the peripheral blood smears from 71.1% of AEL patients. None of the patients showed abnormal coagulation function. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that CD13 (93.5%),CD117(89.1%), HLA-DR(87.0%), and CD34 (80.0%) were highly expressed in AEL, and lymphoid antigens of CD4 (42.9%) and CD7(28.9%) were expressed in partial patients.

In the 34 cases with abnormal karyotype, there were 14(41.2%) cases with simple chromosomal abnomality and 20(58.8%) cases with complex karyotype. The positive rate of fusion gene accounted for 16.7% in 60 patients, and the gene mutations accounted for 77.8% in 27 patients. Among 103 cases of AEL, 81 cases were treated with chemotherapy, but 66 cases can be used for therapeutic analysis, as a results the total complete remission rate derived from 2 courses of treatment was 45.5% (30/66). The relapse rate was 36.7% (11/30), and the median relapse time was 15.5 months (6.2-50 months). The median survival time of 66 patients for therapeutic analysis was 29 months. The median survival time of CR patients was very significantly longer than that of the non-CR patients(P=0.001). The 5 year survival rate of CR patients was 65%, the median time of relapse-free survival (RFS) was 46.2 months and 3-years RFS was 58%.

METHODS: Firstly, Hemin was used to induce K562 cell differentiation, and the expression of Numb was detected by the real-time quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. After K562 cells were synchronized by nocodazole, the Numb protein was labeled by immunohistochemical staining, followed by the determination of the terminally differentiated cells through confocal microscopy. The fluorescence intensity was calculated by Image J software, and the cell division pattern was analyzed on the basis of the fluorescence intensities of Numb in 2 divided daughter cells. RESULTS: Compared with the undifferentiated K562 cells, the level of Numb mRNA expression increased 2.3 times (P<0.001). The ratio of Numb positive cells was(67.37+/-5.01)% in differentiated K562 cells, while that was (43.97+/-5.72)% in undifferentiated K562 cells (P<0.01). Compared with undifferentiated K562 cells, the ratio of cells with asymmetric division in differentiated K562 cells increased 18.3%, the percentage of cells with symmetry self-renewal reduced 49.7%(P<0.001) and that with symmetry differentiation increased 32%(P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In differentiated K562 cells, expression of Numb and proportion of cells with asymmetric division were higher than that in undifferentiated cells. With the differentiation of leukemia cells, the proportion of cells with asymmetrical division increases, and the proportion of cells with symmetrical self-renewal decreases. The stemness of leukemia cells is maintained mainly through the symmetrical self-renewal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BIM is also involved in the responses to glucocorticoid and chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), suggesting a possible association between deletion polymorphism of BIM and the chemosensitivity of ALL. Thus, we analyzed 72 B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL cell lines established from Japanese patients. Indeed, higher BIM gene expression was associated with good in vitro sensitivities to glucocorticoid and chemotherapeutic agents used in induction therapy. We also analyzed the methylation status of the BIM gene promoter by next generation sequencing of genome bisulfite PCR products, since genetic polymorphism could be insignificant when epigenetically inactivated. Hypermethylation of the BIM gene promoter was associated with lower BIM gene expression and poorer sensitivity to vincristine. Of note, however, the prevalence of a deletion polymorphism was not associated with the BIM gene expression level or drug sensitivities in BCP-ALL cell lines, in which the BIM gene was unmethylated. These observations suggest that an association of a deletion polymorphism of BIM and the response to induction therapy in BCP-ALL may be clinically minimal.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Intense immunosuppression (for engraftment and graft-versus-host disease prevention) may constrain the immunologic potency of the graft and limit the antineoplastic capacity of the transplant, thus requiring more intense or more effective conditioning regimens to limit the risks of relapse and permit satisfactory disease-free survival.","['Copyright (c) 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

In 2005, seminal work by multiple groups identified the JAK2V617F mutation in a significant fraction of MPN patients. Since that time, murine models of JAK2V617F have greatly enhanced the understanding of the role of aberrant JAK-STAT signaling in MPN pathogenesis and have provided an in vivo pre-clinical platform that can be used to develop novel therapies. From early retroviral transduction models to transgenics, and ultimately conditional knock-ins, murine models have established that JAK2V617F alone can induce an MPN-like syndrome in vivo. However, additional mutations co-occur with JAK2V617F in MPNs, often in proteins involved in epigenetic regulation that can dramatically influence disease outcomes. In vivo modeling of these mutations in the context of JAK2V617F has provided additional insights into the role of epigenetic dysregulation in augmenting MPN hematopoiesis. In this overview, early murine model development of JAK2V617F is described, with an analysis of its effects on the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell niche and interactions with downstream signaling elements. This is followed by a description of more recent in vivo models developed for evaluating the effect of concomitant mutations in epigenetic modifiers on MPN maintenance and progression. Mouse models of other driver mutations in MPNs, including primarily calreticulin (CALR) and Tpo-receptor (MPL), which occur in a significant percentage of MPN patients with wild-type JAK2, are also briefly reviewed.

Despite the importance of rDNA for cellular function, we know virtually nothing about what governs its copy number, stability, and sequence in the mammalian genome due to challenges associated with mapping and analysis. We applied computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. We find that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Counterintuitively, human cancer genomes show a loss of copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. The sequence can also be more variable in the cancer genome. Cancer genomes with lower copies have mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. The PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor that is critical for genome stability and a negative regulator of the mTOR kinase pathway. Surprisingly, but consistent with the human cancer genomes, hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia have lower rDNA copy number than normal tissue, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. Loss of copies occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Therefore, copy loss is a recurrent feature in cancers associated with mTOR activation. Ribosomal DNA copy number may be a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA damaging treatments.",,,,,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",PMC5480814,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3077-4990', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9707-6057', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0743-3637']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this review article is to summarize optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of various systemic conditions. METHOD: A systematic literature search of the Medline/PubMed database was performed. English articles up to April 2015 were included. Terms used for search included: Alzheimer's Disease; Multiple Sclerosis; Parkinson's Disease; Behcet's Disease; Schizophrenia; Migraine; Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome; Neurofibromatosis; Sickle Cell Disease; Renal diseases; Lupus Retinopathy; Valsalva Retinopathy; Whiplash Retinopathy; Shaken-Baby Syndrome; Choroidal metastases; Intracranial Hypertension; Drug toxicity; Deferoxamine; Sildenafil; Tamoxifen; Hydroxychloroquine; Chloroquine; Ethambutol; Lead; Sickle Cell Disease; and Thalassemia along with OCT. RESULTS: Studies have shown that inner retinal thinning could be the earliest sign of neurological diseases and may help to differentiate individuals with abnormalities. Outer retinal damage was noted in cancer-related retinopathy and secondary to drug toxicity as a diagnostic sign. This review article summarizes the OCT findings and their importance in early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up in a varying spectrum of systemic diseases including neurological diseases, hematological diseases, cancer-related retinopathies, and systemic drug toxicity.

Design: A randomized, crossover, washout trial. Setting: An inpatient acute leukemia unit at the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard L. Solove Research Institute of the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University in Columbus. Sample: 50 patients who were newly diagnosed with acute leukemia and hospitalized to receive their initial four weeks of intensive induction chemotherapy. Methods: Patients were offered a choice of three scents to be used during the trial: lavender, peppermint, or chamomile. Each patient was randomized to receive either the chosen aromatherapy intervention or a placebo intervention during alternate weeks, with a washout period in between. Sleep quality and other common symptoms were measured. Main Research Variables: Aromatherapy, sleep, insomnia, pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, and well-being. Findings: Most patients reported poor quality sleep at baseline, but aromatherapy had a statistically significant positive impact. Improvements were noted in tiredness, drowsiness, lack of appetite, depression, anxiety, and well-being because of aromatherapy. Conclusions: Aromatherapy is a viable intervention for improving insomnia and other symptoms commonly experienced by patients with acute leukemia. Implications for Nursing: Oncology nurses can employ aromatherapy safely and inexpensively, and with minimal training, as an effective tool in decreasing many symptoms that plague patients with leukemia. Patients can exercise a greater sense of control over their treatment environments through the use of aromatherapy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*aromatherapy', '*insomnia', '*symptom management', '*essential oils']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 22.,"BACKGROUND: Studies of chromosomal rearrangements and fusion transcripts have elucidated mechanisms of tumorigenesis and led to targeted cancer therapies. This study was aimed at identifying novel fusion transcripts in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). METHODS: To identify new fusion transcripts associated with EAC, targeted RNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) verification were performed in 40 EACs and matched nonmalignant specimens from the same patients. Genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed to find the breakpoint of fusion genes. RESULTS: Five novel in-frame fusion transcripts were identified and verified in 40 EACs and in a validation cohort of 15 additional EACs (55 patients in all): fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)-GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) in 2 of 55 or 3.6%, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) in 2 of 55 or 3.6%, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 54 (USP54)-calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II gamma (CAMK2G) in 2 of 55 or 3.6%, megakaryoblastic leukemia (translocation) 1 (MKL1)-fibulin 1 (FBLN1) in 1 of 55 or 1.8%, and CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 2 (CNOT2)-chromosome 12 open reading frame 49 (C12orf49) in 1 of 55 or 1.8%. A genomic analysis indicated that NPC1-MELK arose from a complex interchromosomal translocation event involving chromosomes 18, 3, and 9 with 3 rearrangement points, and this was consistent with chromoplexy. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that fusion transcripts occur at a stable frequency in EAC. Furthermore, our results indicate that chromoplexy is an underlying mechanism that generates fusion transcripts in EAC.

However, the role of AQP9 in regulating tumor sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that AQP9 can serve as an independent predictive marker for adjuvant chemotherapy in CRC. Patients with high AQP9 expression had higher rate of disease-free survival (DFS) than those with low AQP9 expression. Upregulation of AQP9 was associated with enhanced chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of AQP9 resulted in an increased intracellular level of 5-FU in CRC cells, hence leading to a higher percentage of apoptosis after 5-FU treatment. Moreover, AQP9 is positively associated with RAS activation and other downstream signaling molecules in CRC. AQP9 overexpression resulted in p21 upregulation and induced S-phase arrest. Taken together, AQP9 enhances the cytotoxic response to 5-FU in CRC cells by simultaneously inducing S-phase arrest via activation of RAS signaling and facilitating drug uptake. Our results suggest that AQP9 might be a novel predictor for the benefit of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in CRC.

The BCR/ABL oncogene activates multiple signaling pathways and involves the dysregulation of oncogenes during the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia. The cell division cycle protein 6, an essential regulator of DNA replication, is elevated in some human cancer cells. However, the expression of cell division cycle protein 6 in chronic myeloid leukemia and the underlying regulatory mechanism remain to be elucidated. In this study, our data showed that cell division cycle protein 6 expression was significantly upregulated in primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells and the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 cells, as compared to the normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 or BCR/ABL small interfering RNA could significantly downregulate cell division cycle protein 6 messenger RNA expression in K562 cells. Moreover, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway inhibitor AG490 could downregulate cell division cycle protein 6 expression in K562 cells, but not RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitor PD98059 had such effect. Cell division cycle protein 6 gene silencing by small interfering RNA effectively resulted in decrease of proliferation, increase of apoptosis, and arrest of cell cycle in K562 cells. These findings have demonstrated that cell division cycle protein 6 overexpression may contribute to the high proliferation and low apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and can be regulated by BCR/ABL signal transduction through downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways, suggesting cell division cycle protein 6 as a potential therapeutic target in chronic myeloid leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'Cell division cycle protein 6', 'K562 cells', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'survival factor']",,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDC6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 22.,"Neonatal tumors are rare with no standard treatment approaches to these diseases, and the patients experience poor outcomes. Our aim was to determine the distribution of cancers affecting neonates and compare survival between these cancers and older children. We analyzed SEER data (1973-2007) from patients who were younger than 2 years at diagnosis of malignancy. Special permission was granted to access the detailed (i.e., age in months) data of those patients. The Chi-square Log-rank test was used to compare survival between neonates (aged <1 month) and older children (>1 month to <2 years). We identified 615 neonatal cancers (454 solid tumors, 93 leukemia/lymphoma, and 68 CNS neoplasms). Neuroblastoma was the most common neonatal tumor followed by Germ cell tumors. The 5-year overall survival (OS) for all neonates was 60.3% (95% CI, 56.2-64.4). Neonates with solid tumors had the highest 5-year OS (71.2%; 95% CI, 66.9-75.5), followed by those with leukemia (39.1%; 95% CI, 28.3-49.9) or CNS tumors (15%; 95% CI, 5.4-24.6). Except for neuroblastoma, all neonatal tumors showed inferior outcomes compared to that in the older group. The proportion of neonates who died from causes other than cancer was significantly higher than that of the older children (37.9% vs. 16.4%; P < 0.0005). In general, the outcome of neonatal cancers has not improved over the last 34 years. The distribution of neonatal cancer is different than other pediatric age groups. Although the progress in neonatal and cancer care over the last 30 years, only death from noncancer causes showed improvement. Studying neonatal tumors as part of national studies is essential to understand their etiology, determine the best treatment approaches, and improve survival and quality of life for those patients.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Advancement in polychromatic flow cytometry has made its identification easier. This prospective study was designed to identify cases of MPAL and study their clinical presentation and haematological profile in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated bone marrow aspirate samples of patients diagnosed as acute leukaemia (AL) on the basis of morphology were utilized for immunophenotyping. A comprehensive panel of fluorochrome-labelled monoclonal antibodies targeting myeloid, B-cell, T-cell and immaturity markers was utilized. The patients diagnosed to have MPAL, on the basis of the World Health Organization 2008 classification, were selected for further analyses. RESULTS: There were 15 (2.99%) patients with MPAL of the total 501 cases of AL. Seven were children, all males and mean age of 5.08+/-3.88 yr. Eight were adults, male:female=6:2 and mean age of 21.43+/-5.74 yr. Eight were diagnosed as B/myeloid and seven were T/myeloid. No association was observed between age and immunophenotype of MPAL. On morphology, 11 were diagnosed as AML and four as ALL, and no specific morphology of blasts was predictive of a MPAL. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: MPAL appeared to be a rare neoplasm (2.99% of AL cases). A comprehensive primary panel of monoclonal antibodies should be used to identify this neoplasm known to have a poor outcome.",,,,,,PMC5501054,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 22.,"Decreased absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) following frontline therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be associated with disease control, even in patients without evidence of minimal residual disease. We studied the prognostic significance of ALCs during the first year following treatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). We evaluated 99 patients who achieved a partial response without lymphocytosis (<4.0 x 10(3) cells/muL) or better after FCR. Absolute lymphocyte counts were recorded at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month posttreatment and correlated with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). For each time point, analyses were limited to patients without lymphocytosis, so as to avoid possible biases from undocumented disease progressions. Lymphopenia (ALC < 1.0 x 10(3) cells/muL) at 3 m after FCR (69% of patients n = 68), was associated with a longer OS (5y OS 91% vs 64%, P = .001), as were ALC </= 2 x 10(3) cells/muL at 6 m (5y OS 85% vs 48%, P = .004) and ALC </= 1.8 x 10(3) cells/muL at 9 m (5y OS 93% vs 54%, P = .009). A normal-range ALC (</=4 x 10(3) cells/muL) at 12 m was also associated with a 91% 5y OS. Higher ALCs (but without lymphocytosis) were associated with shorter EFS (median EFS 27 months for ALC > 1.8 vs not reached for ALC </= 0.7 at 9 months, P < .0001). In conclusion, lower ALC levels in the first few months following frontline FCR therapy were associated with longer OS and EFS. Possible explanations may be that lower ALCs reflect deeper clonal suppression or protracted Treg depletion. Absolute lymphocyte count levels may be a cheap and widely available prognostic marker, though the added value for clinical practice is the minimal residual disease era needs to be explored.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'FCR', 'MRD', 'Treg', 'lymphopenia', 'prognosis']",,"['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7883-289X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3435-8612', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7864-0089']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It binds glycosaminoglycans and certain phospoholipids, which can modulate its inhibitory activity. SERPINA5 has been shown to be internalized by platelets, granulocytes, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, and by Jurkat lymphoma cells. Once inside the cell it can translocate to the nucleus. There are several indications that SERPINA5 can directly cross the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane.

This study explores whether pharmacological intervention of MKL/SRF signaling axis by CCG-1423 is able to suppress angiogenesis. Our studies show that CCG-1423 inhibits migration and cord morphogenesis of EC in vitro and sprouting angiogenesis ex vivo and in vivo, suggesting CCG-1423 could be a novel anti-angiogenic agent. Kymography analyses of membrane dynamics of EC revealed that CCG-1423 treatment causes a major defect in membrane protrusion. CCG-1423 treatment led to attenuated expression of several actin-binding proteins that are important for driving membrane protrusion including ArpC2, VASP, and profilin1 (Pfn1) with the most drastic effect seen on the expression of Pfn1. Finally, depletion of Pfn1 alone is also sufficient for a dramatic decrease in sprouting angiogenesis of EC in vitro and ex vivo, further suggesting that Pfn1 depletion may be one of the mechanisms of the anti-angiogenic action of CCG-1423.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'ArpC2', 'CCG-1423', 'Cell migration', 'Conditional knockout', 'Endothelial cells', 'Profilin-1', 'VASP']","['R01 CA108607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL076124/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCG 1423)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Profilins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",PMC5985144,['NIHMS966609'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, AZA can demethylate FOXP3 intron 1 (FOXP3i1) leading to the generation of regulatory T cells (Treg). Here, we investigated the impact of AZA on xenogeneic graft-vs.-host disease (xGVHD) and graft-vs.-leukemia effects in a humanized murine model of transplantation (human PBMCs-infused NSG mice), and described the impact of the drug on human T cells in vivo. We observed that AZA improved both survival and xGVHD scores. Further, AZA significantly decreased human T-cell proliferation as well as IFNgamma and TNF-alpha serum levels, and reduced the expression of GRANZYME B and PERFORIN 1 by cytotoxic T cells. In addition, AZA significantly increased Treg frequency through hypomethylation of FOXP3i1 as well as increased Treg proliferation. The latter was subsequent to higher STAT5 signaling in Treg from AZA-treated mice, which resulted from higher IL-2 secretion by conventional T cells from AZA-treated mice itself secondary to demethylation of the IL-2 gene promoter by AZA. Importantly, Tregs harvested from AZA-treated mice were suppressive and stable over time since they persisted at high frequency in secondary transplant experiments. Finally, graft-vs.-leukemia effects (assessed by growth inhibition of THP-1 cells, transfected to express the luciferase gene) were not abrogated by AZA. In summary, our data demonstrate that AZA prevents xGVHD without abrogating graft-vs.-leukemia effects.

Underlying cellular mechanisms of graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) are thought to include a prominent role for T cells. Cells of the CB's mother, maternal microchimerism (MMc), were recently strongly, but indirectly, implicated in this GVL benefit. We assayed MMc directly and hypothesized benefit accrues from CB maternal T cells. MMc was quantified in 51 CBs and, within memory T, naive T, B, NK cells, and monocytes in 27 CBs. Polymorphism-specific quantitative-PCR assays targeted maternal genotypes non-shared with CBs. Overall MMc was common and often at substantial levels. It was present in 52.9% of CB and in 33.3-55.6% of tested subsets. Remarkably, MMc quantities were greater in memory T cells than other subsets (p < 0.001). Expressed as genome equivalents (gEq) per 10(5) total gEq tested (gEq/10(5)), memory T cell MMc averaged 850.2 gEq/10(5), while other subset mean quantities were 13.8-30.1 gEq/10(5).

VIP signaling through its receptor VPAC1 on T cells leads to reduced proliferation and a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. We report here that inhibition of the VIP pathway with a peptide antagonist significantly enhances a T-cell-dependent, autologous anti-leukemia response in murine models of acute myeloid leukemia and T lymphoblastic leukemia. Subcutaneous administration of the VIP antagonist, VIPhyb, resulted in reduced tumor burden and significantly enhanced survival (30-50% survival) over vehicle-treated controls (0-20% survival). The T cells in mice treated with VIPhyb expressed lower levels of the co-inhibitory PD-1 and secreted higher levels of IFNgamma. Furthermore, T cells from VIPhyb-treated survivors were protective against C1498 following adoptive transfer. These data highlight the potential for the VIP pathway as a novel target for immunomodulation in settings of hematological malignancies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antagonist', 'T cells', 'checkpoint blockade', 'co-stimulation', 'leukemia']",['R01 CA188523/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC5467986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the risk of ischemic damage and impotence is high with priapism (35%), management guidelines are directed towards rapid treatment of this condition (Salonia et al., 2014). This report describes the rare case of an 18-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) three times with recurrent and worsening episodes of sustained penile erections. On the patient's third visit, he presented with priapism of greater than six-hour duration that was found to be the result of chronic myeloid leukemia.

Application of this therapeutic strategy to cattle requires bovinized chimeric antibody targeting immunoinhibitory molecules. In this study, anti-bovine PD-1 rat-bovine chimeric monoclonal antibody 5D2 (Boch5D2) was constructed with mammalian expression systems, and its biochemical function and antiviral effect were characterized in vitro and in vivo using cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV). Purified Boch5D2 was capable of detecting bovine PD-1 molecules expressed on cell membranes in flow cytometric analysis. In particular, Biacore analysis determined that the binding affinity of Boch5D2 to bovine PD-1 protein was similar to that of the original anti-bovine PD-1 rat monoclonal antibody 5D2. Boch5D2 was also capable of blocking PD-1/PD-L1 binding at the same level as 5D2. The immunomodulatory and therapeutic effects of Boch5D2 were evaluated by in vivo administration of the antibody to a BLV-infected calf. Inoculated Boch5D2 was sustained in the serum for a longer period. Boch5D2 inoculation resulted in activation of the proliferation of BLV-specific CD4(+) T cells and decrease in the proviral load of BLV in the peripheral blood. This study demonstrates that Boch5D2 retains an equivalent biochemical function to that of the original antibody 5D2 and is a candidate therapeutic agent for regulating antiviral immune response in vivo. Clinical efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade awaits further experimentation with a large number of animals.",,['NOTNLM'],"['PD-ligand 1', 'T-cell exhaustion', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'cattle', 'chimeric antibody', 'immunoinhibitory molecules', 'immunotherapy', 'programmed death-1']",,,PMC5461298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 21.,"Although previous studies suggested that the expression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) initiates downstream of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3 ITDs) have recently been suggested to intrinsically suppress HSCs. Herein, single-cell interrogation found Flt3 mRNA expression to be absent in the large majority of phenotypic HSCs, with a strong negative correlation between Flt3 and HSC-associated gene expression. Flt3-ITD knock-in mice showed reduced numbers of phenotypic HSCs, with an even more severe loss of long-term repopulating HSCs, likely reflecting the presence of non-HSCs within the phenotypic HSC compartment. Competitive transplantation experiments established that Flt3-ITD compromises HSCs through an extrinsically mediated mechanism of disrupting HSC-supporting bone marrow stromal cells, with reduced numbers of endothelial and mesenchymal stromal cells showing increased inflammation-associated gene expression.

A subset of highly differentiated NK cells, termed adaptive NK cells, expands naturally in vivo in response to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, carries unique repertoires of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), and displays strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Here, we established a robust and scalable protocol for ex vivo generation and expansion of adaptive NK cells for cell therapy against pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Culture of polyclonal NK cells together with feeder cells expressing HLA-E, the ligand for the activating NKG2C receptor, led to selective expansion of adaptive NK cells with enhanced alloreactivity against HLA-mismatched targets. The ex vivo expanded adaptive NK cells gradually obtained a more differentiated phenotype and were specific and highly efficient killers of allogeneic pediatric T- and precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts, previously shown to be refractory to killing by autologous NK cells and the NK-cell line NK92 currently in clinical testing. Selective expansion of NK cells that express one single inhibitory KIR for self-HLA class I would allow exploitation of the full potential of NK-cell alloreactivity in cancer immunotherapy. In summary, our data suggest that adaptive NK cells may hold utility for therapy of refractory ALL, either as a bridge to transplant or for patients that lack stem cell donors.

Epub 2017 Jun 21.,"Transfer of T-cell receptors (TCRs) specific for tumor-associated antigens is a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. We developed the TCR gene editing technology that is based on the knockout of the endogenous TCR alpha and beta genes, followed by the introduction of tumor-specific TCR genes, and that proved safer and more effective than conventional TCR gene transfer. Although successful, complete editing requires extensive cell manipulation and 4 transduction procedures. Here we propose a novel and clinically feasible TCR ""single editing"" (SE) approach, based on the disruption of the endogenous TCR alpha chain only, followed by the transfer of genes encoding for a tumor-specific TCR. We validated SE with the clinical grade HLA-A2 restricted NY-ESO-1157-165-specific TCR. SE allowed the rapid production of high numbers of tumor-specific T cells, with optimal TCR expression and preferential stem memory and central memory phenotype. Similarly to unedited T cells redirected by TCR gene transfer (TCR transferred [TR]), SE T cells efficiently killed NY-ESO-1(pos) targets; however, although TR cells proved highly alloreactive, SE cells showed a favorable safety profile. Accordingly, when infused in NSG mice previously engrafted with myeloma, SE cells mediated tumor rejection without inducing xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease, thus resulting in significantly higher survival than that observed in mice treated with TR cells. Overall, single TCR gene editing represents a clinically feasible approach that is able to increase the safety and efficacy of cancer adoptive immunotherapy.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (peptide NY-ESO-1 157-165)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0772-1674'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lineage decision of MLL-fusion leukemia is influenced by the fusion partner and microenvironment. To investigate the interplay of fusion proteins and microenvironment in lineage choice, we transplanted human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) expressing MLL-AF9 or MLL-Af4 into immunodeficient NSGS mice, which strongly promote myeloid development. Cells expressing MLL-AF9 efficiently developed AML in NSGS mice. In contrast, MLL-Af4 cells, which were fully oncogenic under lymphoid conditions present in NSG mice, displayed compromised transformation capacity in a myeloid microenvironment. MLL-Af4 activated a self-renewal program in a lineage-dependent manner, showing the leukemogenic activity of MLL-Af4 was interlinked with lymphoid lineage commitment. The C-terminal homology domain (CHD) of Af4 was sufficient to confer this linkage. Although the MLL-CHD fusion protein failed to immortalize HSPCs in myeloid conditions in vitro, it could successfully induce ALL in NSG mice. Our data suggest that defective self-renewal ability and leukemogenesis of MLL-Af4 myeloid cells could contribute to the strong B-cell ALL association of MLL-AF4 leukemia observed in the clinic.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['M01 RR008084/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK090971/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA215504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR026314/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",PMC5561902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germline mutations in DDX41 gene have been discovered in several leukemia families, as well as in mostly adult patients with seemingly spontaneous disease but having strong family histories of myeloid neoplasia. As with other familial genes, DDX41 mutation carriers can develop neoplasia through acquisition of another somatic mutation, thereby affecting both DDX41 alleles. In other patients, somatic mutations of different driver genes can substitute for acquired missense DDX41 during progression. Conversely, non-familial cases with heterozygous somatic DDX41 mutations point towards other mutations that can substitute for the germ line founder DDX41 lesions. In either circumstance, total inactivation of DDX41 appears to be cell-lethal, explaining why frameshift germline lesions have not been found to be accompanied by deletions of the DDX41 locus on 5q. The precise function of the DDX41 protein is unknown; considerable evidence suggests its involvement in RNA splicing. Thus DDX41 can be included in the now large group of mutated spliceosomal genes affected in myeloid neoplasia. However, it appears that DDX4 is so far the only example of a germline spliceosomal mutation in leukemia. Clinically, recognition of DDX41 mutated cases may have implications for surveillance, assessment of prognosis, and, perhaps, for design of targeted therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The pathological features and long-term survival of individuals with familial CEBPA-mutated AML are reminiscent of sporadic CEBPAdm AML. Germline mutations predominantly localize to the N-terminal and are associated with near complete penetrance, with age of AML onset from 2-50 years, frequently accompanied by the acquisition of a second CEBPA mutation in C-terminal domain. Patients appear to have a significant risk of late AML recurrence and these typically represent independent leukemic episodes, characterized by a unique molecular profile that is distinct from that of the preceding tumor. While these patients respond well to salvage therapies, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be considered for patients with high-risk features at presentation or recurrent disease, with the aim of eradicating the germline mutation and improving long-term survival. In contrast, inherited C-terminal CEBPA mutations occur less frequently and appear to demonstrate reduced penetrance, impeding clinical detection and surveillance.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is crucial for the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells. During the past 5 years, germline heterozygous mutations in GATA2 were reported in several hundred patients with various phenotypes ranging from mild cytopenia to severe immunodeficiency involving B cells, natural killer cells, CD4(+) cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (MonoMAC/DCML), and myeloid neoplasia. Some patients additionally show syndromic features such as congenital deafness and lymphedema (originally defining the Emberger syndrome) or pulmonary disease and vascular problems. The common clinical denominator in all reported cohorts is the propensity for myeloid neoplasia (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPN], chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML], acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) with an overall prevalence of approximately 75% and a median age of onset of roughly 20 years. Three major mutational types are encountered in GATA2-deficient patients: truncating mutations prior to ZF2, missense mutations within ZF2, and noncoding variants in the +9.5kb regulatory region of GATA2. Recurrent somatic lesions comprise monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 karyotypes and mutations in SETBP1 and ASXL1 genes.

In some IBMFS, systemic non-hematologic manifestations, including congenital malformations, mucocutaneous abnormalities, developmental delay, and other medical complications, may be present.

The infusion of two CB units from different partially HLA-matched donors (double CBT) is frequently performed in patients who lack a sufficiently rich single CB unit. METHODS: We compared CBT outcomes in patients given single or double CBT following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in a retrospective multicenter registry-based study. Inclusion criteria included adult (>/=18 years) patients, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), complete remission (CR) at the time of transplantation, first single (with a cryopreserved TNC >/= 2.5 x 10(7)/kg) or double CBT between 2004 and 2014, and RIC conditioning. RESULTS: Data from 534 patients with AML (n = 408) or ALL (n = 126) receiving a first single (n = 172) or double (n = 362) CBT were included in the analyses.

Although a critical role in human hematopoiesis and an oncosuppressor role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have been reported, only one polyclonal antibody (named chPTPRG) has been described as capable of recognizing the native antigen of this phosphatase by flow cytometry. Protein biomarkers of CML have not yet found applications in the clinic, and in this study, we have analyzed a group of newly diagnosed CML patients before and after treatment. The aim of this work was to characterize and exploit a newly developed murine monoclonal antibody specific for the PTPRG extracellular domain (named TPgamma B9-2) to better define PTPRG protein downregulation in CML patients. METHODS: TPgamma B9-2 specifically recognizes PTPRG (both human and murine) by flow cytometry, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Co-localization experiments performed with both anti-PTPRG antibodies identified the presence of isoforms and confirmed protein downregulation at diagnosis in the Philadelphia-positive myeloid lineage (including CD34(+)/CD38(bright/dim) cells). After effective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, its expression recovered in tandem with the return of Philadelphia-negative hematopoiesis. Of note, PTPRG mRNA levels remain unchanged in tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) non-responder patients, confirming that downregulation selectively occurs in primary CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of this unique antibody permits its evaluation for clinical application including the support for diagnosis and follow-up of these disorders. Evaluation of PTPRG as a potential therapeutic target is also facilitated by the availability of a specific reagent capable to specifically detect its target in various experimental conditions.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Monoclonal antibody', '*Protein tyrosine phosphatase', '*Tumor suppressor gene']",['11008/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRG protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 5)']",PMC5479035,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2739-4014'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heritable constitutional mutations in the NF1 gene result in dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway and are causative of NF1. The major known function of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin is to downregulate RAS. NF1 exhibits variable clinical expression and is characterized by benign cutaneous lesions including neurofibromas and cafe-au-lait macules, as well as a predisposition to various types of malignancy, such as breast cancer and leukaemia. However, acquired somatic mutations in NF1 are also found in a wide variety of malignant neoplasms that are not associated with NF1. MAIN BODY: Capitalizing upon the availability of next-generation sequencing data from cancer genomes and exomes, we review current knowledge of somatic NF1 mutations in a wide variety of tumours occurring at a number of different sites: breast, colorectum, urothelium, lung, ovary, skin, brain and neuroendocrine tissues, as well as leukaemias, in an attempt to understand their broader role and significance, and with a view ultimately to exploiting this in a diagnostic and therapeutic context. CONCLUSION: As neurofibromin activity is a key to regulating the RAS/MAPK pathway, NF1 mutations are important in the acquisition of drug resistance, to BRAF, EGFR inhibitors, tamoxifen and retinoic acid in melanoma, lung and breast cancers and neuroblastoma. Other curiosities are observed, such as a high rate of somatic NF1 mutation in cutaneous melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian carcinoma and glioblastoma which are not usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Somatic NF1 mutations may be critical drivers in multiple cancers. The mutational landscape of somatic NF1 mutations should provide novel insights into our understanding of the pathophysiology of cancer. The identification of high frequency of somatic NF1 mutations in sporadic tumours indicates that neurofibromin is likely to play a critical role in development, far beyond that evident in the tumour predisposition syndrome NF1.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breast cancer', '*Cancer', '*Glioblastoma', '*Leukaemia', '*Lung cancers', '*Melanoma', '*NF1', '*Phaeochromocytoma', '*Somatic mutations', '*Sporadic tumours']",,,PMC5480124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 3.,"Cross-talk between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is essential for HSCs regulation and leukemogenesis. Studying bone marrow of myelodysplasia patients, a pre-leukemic condition, we found mRNA overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in CD34(+) HSCs and semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) in BMSCs. To better understand the role of VEGFA and SEMA3A in leukemogenesis, we recruited 30 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 29 acute myeloid leukemia (6 secondary to MDS) patients and 12 controls. We found higher VEGFA expression in de novo AML patients (without prior MDS) group (p=0.0073) and higher SEMA3A expression in all BMSCs patient's samples compared to control group. We then overexpressed VEGFA in an acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG1 cells, and in normal CD34(+) cells. This overexpression increased KG1 (p=0.045) and CD34(+) cell (p=0.042) viability and KG1 (p=0.042) and CD34(+) cell (p=0.047) proliferation. Moreover, KG1 and CD34(+) cells overexpressing VEGFA also had increased proliferation when co-cultured with human marrow stromal HS5 cells (p=0.045 and p=0.02, respectively). However, co-culture of these transformed cells with HS5 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 (p=0.004) and CD34(+) (p=0.009) proliferation. Co-culture of KG1 transformed cells with HS27 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 proliferation as well (p=0.01). To investigate whether the dominant SEMA3A effect over VEGFA could be due to competition for neuropilin1 receptor (NRP1), we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-NRP1 antibody of cell extracts of co-cultured KG1 and HS5 cells, induced or not by VEGFA and SEMA3A recombinant proteins. Results showed a preferential association of NRP1 with SEMA3A, suggesting that SEMA3A can partially reverse the effects caused by the VEGFA preventing its binding with the NRP1 receptor. Since both hematopoietic cells, leukemic and normal, showed similar behavior, we suppose that the attempt to reversion of VEGF effects by SEMA3A is a homeostatic phenomenon in the hematopoietic niche. Finally, we conclude that VEGFA overexpression confers AML cell advantages and SEMA3A may partially reverse this effect; thus, SEMA3A protein combined with VEGFA inhibitors could be beneficial for AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

In AHSCT, donor T cells facilitate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment, contribute to anti-infection immunity, and mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses. However, activated alloreactive T cells also attack recipient cells in vital organs, leading to GVHD. Different T-cell subsets, including naive T (TN) cells, memory T (TM) cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells mediate different forms of GVHD and GVL; TN cells mediate severe GVHD, whereas TM cells do not cause GVHD, but preserve T-cell function including GVL. In addition, metabolic reprogramming controls T-cell differentiation and activation in these disease states. This minireview focuses on the role and the related mechanisms of TM cells in AHSCT, and the potential manipulation of T cells in AHSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"Laromustine (also known as cloretazine, onrigin, VNP40101M, 101M) is a prodrug of 90CE, a short-lived chloroethylating agent with anticancer activity. The short half-life of 90CE necessitates the use of latentiated prodrug forms for in vivo treatments. Alkylaminocarbonyl-based prodrugs such as laromustine exhibit significantly superior in vivo activity in several murine tumor models compared to analogs utilizing acyl, and alkoxycarbonyl latentiating groups. The alkylaminocarbonyl prodrugs possess two exclusive characteristics: (i) They are primarily unmasked by spontaneous base catalyzed elimination; and (ii) they liberate a reactive carbamoylating species. Previous speculations as to the therapeutic superiority of laromustine have focused upon the inhibition of enzymes by carbamoylation. We have investigated the therapeutic interactions of analogs with segregated chloroethylating and carbamoylating activities (singly and in combination) in the in vivo murine L1210 leukemia model. The combined treatment with chloroethylating and carbamoylating prodrugs failed to result in any synergism and produced a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy compared to the chloroethylating prodrug alone.

However, the incidences and types of these cytogenetic abnormalities after treatment vary due to the limited populations enroled. METHODS: We analysed the frequency and types of CPCA in a cohort of 607 CML patients in the chronic phase after TKI treatment. We also followed up these CPCA with a median of 31.8 months (range from 11 to 63 months) from diagnosis and investigated their effects on disease progression. RESULTS: We found 18 out of 607 CML patients had cytogenetic abnormality in the Ph-negative cells with an incidence of 3%. In total, six types of chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in these 18 patients with the majority of them aneuploidy abnormalities, especially the trisomy 8. Four of 18 patients (22.2%) were noted to have several abnormalities in the Ph-negative cells. Furthermore, follow-up studies of these CPCA showed that they could be either persistent or transient (15 vs 3 patients), and may not affect disease progression since none of them developed transformed myelodysplasia or transformed acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Three percent of CML patients in the chronic phase were observed to have CPCA during TKI treatment. Our results suggest that the detection of CPCA in CML may not predict disease progression.",['(c) 2017 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myelogenous leukaemia', '*clonal Philadelphia chromosome-negative cytogenetic abnormality', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5483-1606'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, taking into consideration the fact that cholesterol plays a key role in cell proliferation, it should be remembered that its low blood level may be linked to high cholesterol demands from neoplastic cells. The literature review analyzes the results of recent investigations of lipid metabolism in patients with hematologic cancers and their other types. All given investigations show a significant reduction in the serum levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins in patients with hematological disease at its onset. The data for other indicators of the lipid transport system are ambiguous. Such changes have been elucidated to be associated with the accumulation of cholesterol in the leukemia cells due to enhanced synthesis de novo, a more active absorption from circulation and blocked release of its surplus. If the disease runs a favorable course, lipid metabolic parameters become normalized and, in case of remission, correspond to those seen in healthy individuals. They continue to decline in patients with disease progression. This allows the consideration of cholesterol, its fractions, and apolipoproteins as biochemical prognostic markers in hematological cancer patients and as indicators for assessment of treatment results. In addition, there is evidence for the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on lipid metabolism.

The role of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) in hematopoiesis is very important, as the fusion of RARalpha gene with PML gene initiates acute promyelocytic leukemia where differentiation of the myeloid lineage is blocked, followed by an uncontrolled proliferation of leukemic blasts. RARalpha takes part in regulation of VDR transcription, and unliganded RARalpha acts as a transcriptional repressor to VDR gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. This is why we decided to examine the effects of the combination of 1,25D and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on VDR gene expression in normal human and murine blood cells at various steps of their development. We tested the expression of VDR and regulation of this gene in response to 1,25D or ATRA, as well as transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors VDR and RARs in human and murine blood cells. We discovered that regulation of VDR expression in humans is different from in mice. In human blood cells at early stages of their differentiation ATRA, but not 1,25D, upregulates the expression of VDR. In contrast, in murine blood cells 1,25D, but not ATRA, upregulates the expression of VDR.

Here, it is demonstrated that untreated and cytarabine (AraC)-treated IGH/MYC-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells accumulate a high number of potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and display low levels of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein, which is a key element of homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair. BRCA2 deficiency in IGH/MYC-positive cells was associated with diminished HR activity and hypersensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors (olaparib, talazoparib) used alone or in combination with cytarabine in vitro Moreover, talazoparib exerted a therapeutic effect in NGS mice bearing primary Burkitt lymphoma xenografts. In conclusion, IGH/MYC-positive Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia cells have decreased BRCA2 and are sensitive to PARP1 inhibition alone or in combination with other chemotherapies.Implications: This study postulates that IGH/MYC-induced BRCA2 deficiency may predispose Burkitt lymphoma cells to synthetic lethality triggered by PARP1 inhibitors.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/15/8/967/F1.large.jpgMol Cancer Res; 15(8); 967-72.

When symptomatic, due to mostly anemia and neutropenia, therapy choices are often empirically-based, because only few clinical trials and systematic studies have been performed. Incorporating new molecular and flow cytometry parameters, we identified 204 patients fulfilling uniform criteria for LGLL diagnoses and analyzed clinical course with median follow-up of 36 months, including responses to treatments. While selection of initial treatment was dictated by clinical features, the initial responses, as well as overall responses to methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine (CsA), and cyclophosphamide (CTX), were similar at 40-50% across drugs. Sequential use of these drugs resulted in responses in most cases: only 10-20% required salvage therapies such as ATG, Campath, tofacitinib, splenectomy or abatacept. MTX yielded the most durable responses.

The polyamine metabolism and function are dysregulated in tumor cells making them an attractive therapeutic target by employing polyamine analogs. These analogs have a high degree of similarity with the structure of polyamines but not with their function. Multidrug resistance is a major factor in the failure of many chemotherapeutic drugs which necessitates further research and exploration of better novel alternatives. In the present study, Twenty-six novel acylspermidine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities on human breast cancer cells and T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The cell proliferation and apoptosis assays using WST-1 and annexin-V/7AAD staining respectively suggest that Compound 1 (C19H41N3O2), Compound 7(C25H51N3O2) and Compound 8 (C29H59N3O) significantly reduced cancer cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, compounds 7, 8 and 9 had slight or no effect on cell proliferation of non-cancerous cells. These studies speculate that these novel acylspermidine derivatives could be promising candidates in designing an anti-proliferative drug, targeting both solid and blood cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MLL and WDR5 localize to the mitotic spindle apparatus, and loss of function of MLL complex by RNAi results in defects in chromosome congression and compromised spindle formation. We report interaction of MLL complex with several kinesin and dynein motors. We further show that the MLL complex associates with Kif2A, a member of the Kinesin-13 family of microtubule depolymerase, and regulates the spindle localization of Kif2A during mitosis. We have identified a conserved WDR5 interaction (Win) motif, so far unique to the MLL family, in Kif2A. The Win motif of Kif2A engages in direct interactions with WDR5 for its spindle localization.

The aim of the study was to analyze outcomes of a cohort of immunocompromised children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilated with a strategy of stepwise increasing PCO2 targets up to 140 mm Hg. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of outcomes of a cohort of children with oncologic disease or after stem cell transplantation and severe respiratory failure in comparison with a historical control cohort. RESULTS: Out of 150 episodes of admission to the PICU 88 children underwent invasive mechanical ventilation for >24h (overall survival 75%). In a subgroup of 38 children with high ventilator requirements the PCO2 target ranges were increased stepwise. Fifteen children survived and were discharged from the PICU. Severe pulmonary hypertension was seen in two patients and no case of cerebral edema was observed. Long term outcome was available in 15 patients and 10 of these patients survived without adverse neurological sequelae. With introduction of this strategy survival of immunocompromised children undergoing mechanical ventilation for >24h increased to 48% compared to 32% prior to introduction (historical cohort). CONCLUSIONS: A ventilation strategy incorporating very high carbon dioxide levels to allow for low tidal volumes and limited inspiratory pressures is feasible in children. Even severe hypercapnia may be well tolerated. No severe side effects associated with hypercapnia were observed. This strategy could potentially increase survival in immunocompromised children with severe ARDS.,,,,,,PMC5478142,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1303-3699'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"Purpose We compared two induction regimens, idarubicin (12 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days) versus high-dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days), in young adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients and Methods A total of 299 patients (149 randomly assigned to cytarabine plus idarubicin [AI] and 150 assigned to cytarabine plus high-dose daunorubicin [AD]) were analyzed. All patients received cytarabine (200 mg/m(2)/d for 7 days). Results Complete remission (CR) was induced in 232 patients (77.6%), with no difference in CR rates between the AI and AD arms (80.5% v 74.7%, respectively; P = .224). At a median follow-up time of 34.9 months, survival and relapse rates did not differ between the AI and AD arms (4-year overall survival, 51.1% v 54.7%, respectively; P = .756; cumulative incidence of relapse, 35.2% v 25.1%, respectively; P = .194; event-free survival, 45.5% v 50.8%, respectively; P = .772). Toxicity profiles were also similar in the two arms. Interestingly, overall and event-free survival times of patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation were significantly different (AI v AD: median overall survival, 15.5 months v not reached, respectively; P = .030; event-free survival, 11.9 months v not reached, respectively; P = .028). Conclusion This phase III trial comparing idarubicin with high-dose daunorubicin did not find significant differences in CR rates, relapse, and survival.

METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Content analyses of semistructured interviews that were conducted with each participant prior to hospital discharge.. FINDINGS: Most participants were not meeting the recommended physical activity levels of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week before their diagnosis. Patients were highly pleased with the exercise intervention and the overall program. Common barriers to exercise were anxiety and aches and pains.. INTERPRETATION: Overall, participants experienced physical and psychological benefits with the exercise intervention with no adverse events from exercising regularly during induction chemotherapy. Referrals for cancer rehabilitation management will lead to prolonged recovery benefits..

DESIGN: A prospective, repeated measures design.. SETTING: Pediatric oncology treatment centers at Banner-University Medical Center Tucson/Banner Children's-Diamond Medical Center (University of Arizona) and Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology centers (Baylor College of Medicine) in Houston. . SAMPLE: 71 children with ALL, with a mean age of 6.18 years at the time of diagnosis. . METHODS: Using mixed-effects latent growth curve modeling with time since diagnosis as a fixed effect, age-adjusted standardized measures of working memory, processing speed, executive function, and attention were obtained and repeated about one and two years later. A subsample was tested for academic achievement at the end of treatment.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Verbal working memory, visual spatial memory, processing speed, academic achievement, age, and gender. . FINDINGS: A significant main effect was observed for age at diagnosis on decline in verbal working memory during treatment. Planned contrasts revealed greater decline among children who were diagnosed when aged younger than five years compared to those diagnosed when aged five years or older. Decline in verbal working memory and achievement in letter-word identification and calculation skills were associated, and decline in spatial memory was associated with calculation. A main effect of gender was observed on processing speed, with female patients showing greater decline than male patients. . CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study may guide the timing of interventions that could improve school achievement among survivors. .

Two ovarian cancer cell lines (sensitive A2780 and partly resistant SKOV3) and two lymphoblast cancer cell lines (sensitive CCRF/CEM and completely resistant CEM/ADR) were used. The observed effects varied among sesquiterpenes and also differed in individual cell lines, with only VAL being effective in all the cell lines. A strong synergism of DOX with NER was found in the A2780 cells, while DOX acted synergistically with HUM and CAO in the SKOV3 cells. In the CCRF/CEM cells, a synergism of DOX with CAO and NER was observed. In resistant CEM/ADR cells, sesquiterpenes did not increase DOX efficacy, although they significantly increased accumulation of DOX (up to 10-times) and rhodamine-123 (substrate of efflux transporter ABCB1) within cancer cells.

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"Within the cohort of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a group that responds dramatically (VR-PAH) to an acute vasodilator challenge and that has excellent long-term hemodynamic improvement and prognosis on high dose calcium channel blockers compared with vasodilator non-responders (VN-PAH). For the purposes of diagnosing VR-PAH, there is to date no test to replace the acute vasodilator challenge. However, recent studies have identified markers that may aid in the identification of VR-PAH, including peripheral blood lymphocyte RNA expression levels of desmogelin-2 and Ras homolog gene family member Q, and plasma levels of provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus. Genome wide-array studies of peripheral blood DNA have demonstrated differences in disease specific genetic variants between VR-PAH and NR-PAH, with particular convergence on cytoskeletal function pathways and Wnt signaling pathways. These studies offer hope for future non-invasive identification of VR-PAH, and insights into pathogenesis that may lead to novel therapies. Examination of the degree of pulmonary microvascular perfusion in PAH has offered additional insights. During the acute vasodilator challenge, VR-PAH patients demonstrate true vasodilation with recruitment and increased perfusion of the capillary bed, while VN-PAH patients are unable to recruit vasculature. In the very few reports of lung histology, VR-PAH has more medial thickening in the precapillary arterioles, while VN-PAH has the classic histology of PAH, including intimal thickening. VR-PAH is a disorder with a phenotype distinct from VN-PAH and other types of PAH, and should be considered separately in the classification of PAH.",,['NOTNLM'],"['calcium channel blocker', 'microvasculature', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'pulmonary capillary surface area', 'pulmonary vascular imaging', 'vasodilator responsiveness']",,,PMC5841907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the clinical significance of repeat blood cultures in persistent and recurrent fever during neutropenia in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the chemotherapy cycles at our centre between January 2007 and December 2015. Blood cultures obtained within three days after initial febrile neutropenia (FN) were defined as initial blood cultures and those obtained on or after day 4 were defined as repeat blood cultures. RESULTS: Overall, 321 chemotherapy cycles in 89 patients were subjected to review. FN was identified in 276 (86.0%) chemotherapy cycles. In persistent FN (134 episodes), the causative pathogens were detected by repeat blood cultures in seven episodes (5.2%), including only three episodes (2.2%) of new infection. Shaking chills and high body temperature were identified as significant predictors for bloodstream infection (BSI). In recurrent FN (85 episodes), the causative pathogens were detected in seven episodes (8.2%), and all of these were new organisms. The frequency of detecting new pathogens by repeat blood cultures in recurrent FN (7/85) was higher than that in persistent FN (3/134) (p = .0491). A history of recent BSI was identified as a significant predictor for BSI in recurrent FN. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic yield of repeat blood cultures for persistent FN was low in intensive chemotherapy for AML and MDS. The frequency of repeat blood cultures for persistent FN could be reduced based on predictors.

There is no consensus on the clinical incorporation of CNA in B-ALL. An integrated genomic classification (IGC) has been proposed which includes CNA and cytogenetics. METHODS: We correlated this IGC with immunophenotypic minimal residual disease (MRD) as well as other standard criteria for 245 patients of B-ALL such as National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk, D+8 prednisolone response, cytogenetics, and ploidy status. RESULTS: MRD was detectable in 81 patients (33.1%). The most common abnormalities were seen in CDKN2A/B (25.7%) followed by PAX5(20%), ETV6(16.7%), IKZF1(15.5%), Rb1(5.3%), BTG (3.3%), EBF1(2.0%), and PAR1(0.8%). On integrating CNA into the IGC, 170 patients (69.4%) were classified into good genomic risk (GEN-GR) whereas 75 (30.6%) belonged to the poor genomic risk (GEN-PR) category. The IGC showed a significant correlation with MRD and NCI risk. The presence of CNA predicted MRD clearance in intermediate cytogenetics group. CONCLUSION: These data seem to indicate that in addition to cytogenetics, CNA should be incorporated into routine clinical testing and risk algorithms for B-ALL. The IGC is of prognostic relevance and offers an additional avenue for prognostication and risk-adapted therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They show a wide variety of clinicopathological features and generally associated with poor clinical outcome. Lymphoma data from different geographic regions will definitely aid in routine clinical practice and research work. PTCLs are reported with a higher frequency in Asia as compared to Western countries. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency and distribution of PTCLs diagnosed in a tertiary care cancer center in Kerala. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study carried out in the Division of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, for 5 years from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015. All PTCLs diagnosed during this period were reviewed and then classified according to the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms. Statistical significance of the results was evaluated using Chi-square test. RESULTS: Among the total 3108 cases of lymphomas diagnosed at our center, 2404 cases were NHLs (77.35%). PTCLs (n = 333) contributed 13.85% of all NHLs. Among these, PTCL, not otherwise specified, constituted the most common subtype (92 cases, 27.63%), followed by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (79 cases, 23.72%), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (75 cases, 22.52%), mycosis fungoides (28 cases, 8.40%), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (28 cases, 8.40%). CONCLUSION: This is the largest study on PTCLs reported from Kerala. We document that the frequency of PTCLs is higher than that reported from Western studies. The frequency of ATLL reported from Kerala is much higher than that reported from other states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, idenication of novel compounds that modulate the activity of such pathways could be a new approach in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Previous studies have demonstrated that indole-3-carbinol inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of various tumor cells. However, its anticancer activity against chronic myeloid leukemia cells and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Our data revealed that indole-3-carbinol promoted mitochondrial apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia-derived K562 cells, as evidenced by the activation of caspases and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Treatment with indole-3-carbinol was found to be associated with a decrease in the cellular levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the downregulation of genes is regulated by Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5. We also found that treatment with indole-3-carbinol resulted in the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and reduced expression of human telomerase and c-Myc. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the oncogenic signal transducer and activator of transcription 5/Akt pathway is a cellular target for indole-3-carbinol in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, this clinically tested natural compound can be a potential candidate in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia following confirmation with clinical studies.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'K562 cells', 'indole-3-carbinol', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 5']",,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'C11E72455F (indole-3-carbinol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 11.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of blinatumomab (Blincyto) vs standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy in adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (Ph-) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on the results of the phase 3 TOWER study from a US healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: The Blincyto Global Economic Model (B-GEM), a partitioned survival model, was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of blinatumomab vs SOC. Response rates, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), numbers of cycles of blinatumomab and SOC, and transplant rates were estimated from TOWER. EFS and OS were estimated by fitting parametric survival distributions to failure-time data from TOWER. Utility values were based on EORTC-8D derived from EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments in TOWER. A 50-year lifetime horizon and US payer perspective were employed. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: The B-GEM projected blinatumomab to yield 1.92 additional life years and 1.64 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SOC at an incremental cost of $180,642. The ICER for blinatumomab vs SOC was estimated to be $110,108/QALY gained in the base case. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the number and cost of inpatient days for administration of blinatumomab and SOC, and was more favorable in the sub-group of patients who had received no prior salvage therapy. At an ICER threshold of $150,000/QALY gained, the probability that blinatumomab is cost-effective was estimated to be 74%. LIMITATIONS: The study does not explicitly consider the impact of adverse events of the treatment; no adjustments for long-term transplant rates were made. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SOC, blinatumomab is a cost-effective treatment option for adults with R/R Ph - B-precursor ALL from the US healthcare perspective at an ICER threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. The value of blinatumomab is derived from its incremental survival and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) benefit over SOC.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Blinatumomab', 'ICER', 'TOWER', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cost effectiveness']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 20.,"With the introduction of next-generation sequencing, the genetic landscape of the complex group of B-cell lymphoid malignancies has rapidly been unravelled in recent years. This has provided important information about recurrent genetic events and identified key pathways deregulated in each lymphoma subtype. In parallel, there has been intense search and development of novel types of targeted therapy that 'hit' central mechanisms in lymphoma pathobiology, such as BTK, PI3K or BCL2 inhibitors. In this review, we will outline the current view of the genetic landscape of selected entities: follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and marginal zone lymphoma. We will detail recurrent alterations affecting important signalling pathways, that is the B-cell receptor/NF-kappaB pathway, NOTCH signalling, JAK-STAT signalling, p53/DNA damage response, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, as well as other perhaps unexpected cellular processes, such as immune regulation, cell migration, epigenetic regulation and RNA processing. Whilst many of these pathways/processes are commonly altered in different lymphoid tumors, albeit at varying frequencies, others are preferentially targeted in selected B-cell malignancies. Some of these genetic lesions are either involved in disease ontogeny or linked to the evolution of each disease and/or specific clinicobiological features, and some of them have been demonstrated to have prognostic and even predictive impact. Future work is especially needed to understand the therapy-resistant disease, particularly in patients treated with targeted therapy, and to identify novel targets and therapeutic strategies in order to realize true precision medicine in this clinically heterogeneous patient group.",['(c) 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphomas', '*deregulated pathways', '*genetic aberrations', '*next-generation sequencing', '*prognosis']",,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0211-8788'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thioether-containing macrocycles are also attracting attention as protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. Here, we used a model PPI between alpha-helical mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein and kinase-inducible domain interacting (KIX) domain to evaluate oxidation effects on sulfurcontaining macrocycle structure, stability, and protein affinity. Desolvation effects from various polarity states were evaluated computationally and experimentally at the side chain, amino acid, and peptide level. Sulfur-containing side chains spanned polarity ranges between all-hydrocarbon and lactam bridges for modulating solubility, cellular uptake, and affinity. Helical propensity studies showed that, although oxidized sulfur-containing side chains could be tolerated, conformational effects were sequence-dependent. In some cases, proteolytic stability, binding capacity with KIX, and increased helicity were obtained as first steps toward developing PPI inhibitors.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Epub 2017 Jul 19.,"Reduced-toxicity conditioning with fludarabine and treosulfan is a dose-intensive regimen with enhanced anti-leukemia effect and acceptable toxicity in AML/MDS. HLA-C regulates natural-killer (NK) cell function by inhibiting Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and is divided into C1 and C2 epitopes. The missing-ligand theory suggests that missing recipient KIR ligands drives NK-alloreactivity after SCT, in the absence of HLA-mismatch by activating unlicensed donor NK cells. We analyzed SCT outcomes in 203 patients with AML/MDS, median age 58 years, given SCT from matched-siblings (n = 97) or matched-unrelated donors (n = 106), using two treosulfan doses (total 36 or 42 g/m(2) ). 34% expressed one HLA-C group 1 allele (C1C1), 19% one HLA-C group 2 allele (C2C2), and 48% both KIR ligands (C1C2). Median follow-up was 48 months. 5-year relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were 38%, 27%, and 36%, respectively. Relapse rates were 43%, 45%, and 26% in patients expressing C1C1, C1C2, and C2C2 ligands, respectively (P = .03). Multivariate-analysis identified chemo-refractory disease (HR 3.1, P = .003), poor cytogenetics (HR 1.7, P = .08), female donor to male recipient (HR 0.4, P = .01) and C2C2 ligands (HR 0.4, P = .04) as independent factors predicting relapse. HLA-C ligands were not associated with GVHD or NRM. LFS was 33%, 30%, and 46%, respectively (P = .07). Chemorefractory disease (HR 3.1, P = .0004) and C2C2 group ligand (HR 0.6, P = .06) independently predicted LFS. Treosulfan dose did not predict any SCT outcome. In conclusion, missing HLA-C group 1 ligand is associated with reduced relapse risk, similar NRM and improved LFS, after HLA-matched SCT with treosulfan conditioning in AML/MDS.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8782-6160'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now investigated this constitutive release of protease/protease regulators associated with carcinogenesis (ADAM12, uPA, cystatin B), angiogenesis (serpin E1, uPA, CD147), cancer cell migration (uPA, cystatin C), coagulation (ADAM TS13, serpin C1), inflammation (fetuin A, caspase 1, cystatin C), monocytic differentiation (CFD) or regulation of hematopoiesis (neutrophil elastase). METHODS: AML blasts from 79 consecutive patients were cultured in serum-free medium and mediator levels determined in culture supernatants. RESULTS: Detectable release of serpin C1 and E1, cystatin B and C, CD147 and uPA was seen for most patients. These mediators together with fetuin A, caspase 1, and CFD were included in a hierarchical clustering analysis and three patient subsets were identified (high, intermediate, and low release). High levels were associated with monocytic differentiation. Global gene expression analyses showed increased levels of several zinc finger proteins for low-release patients and high expression of several cell surface molecules, ATPases, and calcium-binding proteins for high-release patients. Constitutive release of several mediators was also seen for normal hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stem cells. In cocultures of the latter and AML blasts, the release level for most mediators was altered to resemble the levels of the mesenchymal cells cultured alone. CONCLUSION: Differences in constitutive release of protease/protease regulators are a part of the disease heterogeneity in AML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cytogenetics', 'Differentiation', 'Protease']",,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this analysis were to describe the pharmacokinetics of volasertib and cytarabine, administered as single agents or in combination. METHODS: Three thousand, six hundred and six plasma volasertib concentrations from 501 patients receiving either volasertib alone, or in combination with cytarabine, and 826 plasma cytarabine concentrations from 650 patients receiving cytarabine as multiple subcutaneous injections per cycle either alone, or in combination with volasertib, were analysed using NONMEM Version 7.3. Covariates evaluated included demographic and disease-related parameters. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of volasertib were found to be dose independent from 150 to 550 mg. Body surface area and ethnicity showed significant effects in all the patients. This is reflected as an increase in drug exposure for Japanese patients, although this finding has to be interpreted with caution because only 7% of patients were part of that population group. Volasertib showed low-to-mild inter-individual variability in total clearance. For the case of cytarabine, its pharmacokinetics was affected by body surface area. Finally, volasertib and cytarabine did not influence the pharmacokinetic characteristics of each other. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of volasertib in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia alone or in combination with cytarabine is predictable and associated with low-to-mild patient variability with the exception of the high variability associated with the volume of distribution of the central compartment, having no effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.",,,,,"['0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Pteridines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3700-8658'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FA is caused by the genetic disruption of a cellular pathway that repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks. The impaired function of this pathway, and the genetic instability that results, is considered the main pathogenic mechanism behind this disease. The identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes (for example, BRCA1/FANCS and BRCA2/FANCD1) as being major players in the FA pathway has led to a surge in molecular studies, resulting in the concept of the FA-BRCA pathway. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the molecular pathogenesis of FA from three viewpoints: (a) new FA genes, (b) modifier pathways that influence the cellular and clinical phenotypes of FA and (c) non-canonical functions of FA genes that may drive disease progression independently of deficient DNA repair. Potential therapeutic approaches for FA that are relevant to each will also be proposed.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Aldehydes', 'Autophagy', 'Bone marrow failure', 'DNA interstrand crosslink repair', 'TGFbeta']","['T32 CA009351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD043376/National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'R01 CA125636/National Cancer Institute', '15K21771/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'K12 HD043376/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009351/National Institutes of Health']","['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",PMC5904331,['NIHMS955938'],,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7746-3658'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For real-time analysis of metabolic flux in intact cells or organisms, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and imaging methods have been developed in conjunction with hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. These approaches enable noninvasive monitoring of tumor progression and treatment efficacy and are being tested in multiple clinical trials. However, because of their limited sensitivity, these methods require a larger number of cells, on the order of 10(7), which is impractical for analyzing scant target cells or mass-limited samples. We present a new technology platform, a hyperpolarized micromagnetic resonance spectrometer (HMRS), that achieves real-time, 10(3)-fold more sensitive metabolic analysis on live cells. This platform enables quantification of the metabolic flux in a wide range of cell types, including leukemia stem cells, without significant changes in viability, which allows downstream molecular analyses in tandem. It also enables rapid assessment of metabolic changes by a given drug, which may direct therapeutic choices in patients. We further advanced this platform for high-throughput analysis of hyperpolarized molecules by integrating a three-dimensionally printed microfluidic system. The HMRS platform holds promise as a sensitive method for studying metabolic dynamics in mass-limited samples, including primary cancer cells, providing novel therapeutic targets and an enhanced understanding of cellular metabolism.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer metabolism', '*Hyperpolarization', '*Leukemia stem cells', '*Nuclear magnetic resonance', '*metabolic flux', '*microfluidics']","['R00 EB014328/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA205322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA212958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL113156/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC5473678,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1165-6991', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0087-0909']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other etiologies include aortitis associated with other autoimmune disorders, infectious causes, and paraneoplastic and idiopathic cases. We describe a rare case of a large-vessel arteritis occurring in association with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A 68-year-old female with recent diagnosis of CMML presented to our office for evaluation of abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) that showed inflammation surrounding the entirety of thoracic and abdominal aorta, consistent with aortitis. In the absence of other evident causes of large-vessel vasculitis, we attributed this finding to a paraneoplastic autoimmune phenomenon and started treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. This rare case emphasizes the need to recognize autoimmune complications in CMML and treat the inflammation along with the primary malignancy promptly.",,,,,,PMC5463136,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6409-8439', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1840-8763']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, sample-to-sample variability, due to antibody staining and/or instrument sensitivity, can introduce substantial artifacts into the data, which can in turn lead to erroneous conclusions. This variability can be eliminated by sample barcoding which enables samples to be pooled, stained and run simultaneously. Existing mass cytometry barcoding approaches require time intensive labeling, reduce the number of biologically meaningful parameters and/or rely on expensive reagents.

Epub 2017 Jun 19.,"Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a large innate-like T-cell subset in humans defined by invariant TCR Valpha7.2 use and expression of CD161. MAIT cells recognize microbial riboflavin metabolites of bacterial or fungal origin presented by the monomorphic MR1 molecule. The extraordinary level of evolutionary conservation of MR1 and the limited known diversity of riboflavin metabolite antigens have suggested that MAIT cells are relatively homogeneous and uniform in responses against diverse microbes carrying the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. The ability of MAIT cells to exhibit microbe-specific functional specialization has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we found that MAIT cell responses against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans displayed microbe-specific polyfunctional response profiles, antigen sensitivity, and response magnitudes. MAIT cell effector responses against E. coli and C. albicans displayed differential MR1 dependency and TCR beta-chain bias, consistent with possible divergent antigen subspecificities between these bacterial and fungal organisms. Finally, although the MAIT cell immunoproteome was overall relatively homogenous and consistent with an effector memory-like profile, it still revealed diversity in a set of natural killer cell-associated receptors.

Epub 2017 Jun 19.,"Chromosomal rearrangements between 3q21 and 3q26 induce inappropriate EVI1 expression by recruiting a GATA2-distal hematopoietic enhancer (G2DHE) to the proximity of the EVI1 gene, leading to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The acquisition of G2DHE by the EVI1 gene reciprocally deprives this enhancer of 1 of the 2 GATA2 alleles, resulting in a loss-of-function genetic reduction in GATA2 abundance. Because GATA2 haploinsufficiency is strongly associated with MDS and AML, we asked whether EVI1 misexpression and GATA2 haploinsufficiency both contributed to the observed leukemogenesis by using a 3q21q26 mouse model that recapitulates the G2DHE-driven EVI1 misexpression, but in this case, it was coupled to a Gata2 heterozygous germ line deletion. Of note, the Gata2 heterozygous deletion promoted the EVI1-provoked leukemic transformation, resulting in early onset of leukemia. The 3q21q26 mice suffered from leukemia in which B220(+) cells and/or Gr1(+) leukemic cells occupied their bone marrows. We found that the B220(+)Gr1(-)c-Kit(+) population contained leukemia-initiating cells and supplied Gr1(+) leukemia cells in the 3q21q26 leukemia. When Gata2 expression levels in the B220(+)Gr1(-)c-Kit(+) cells were decreased as a result of Gata2 heterozygous deletion or spontaneous phenomenon, myeloid differentiation of the B220(+)Gr1(-)c-Kit(+) cells was suppressed, and the cells acquired induced proliferation as well as B-lymphoid-primed characteristics. Competitive transplantation analysis revealed that Gata2 heterozygous deletion confers selective advantage to EVI1-expressing leukemia cell expansion in recipient mice. These results demonstrate that both the inappropriate stimulation of EVI1 and the loss of 1 allele equivalent of Gata2 expression contribute to the acceleration of leukemogenesis.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 19.,"ETV6-RUNX1 is associated with the most common subtype of childhood leukemia. As few ETV6-RUNX1 carriers develop precursor B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (pB-ALL), the underlying genetic basis for development of full-blown leukemia remains to be identified, but the appearance of leukemia cases in time-space clusters keeps infection as a potential causal factor. Here, we present in vivo genetic evidence mechanistically connecting preleukemic ETV6-RUNX1 expression in hematopoetic stem cells/precursor cells (HSC/PC) and postnatal infections for human-like pB-ALL. In our model, ETV6-RUNX1 conferred a low risk of developing pB-ALL after exposure to common pathogens, corroborating the low incidence observed in humans. Murine preleukemic ETV6-RUNX1 pro/preB cells showed high Rag1/2 expression, known for human ETV6-RUNX1 pB-ALL. Murine and human ETV6-RUNX1 pB-ALL revealed recurrent genomic alterations, with a relevant proportion affecting genes of the lysine demethylase (KDM) family. KDM5C loss of function resulted in increased levels of H3K4me3, which coprecipitated with RAG2 in a human cell line model, laying the molecular basis for recombination activity. We conclude that alterations of KDM family members represent a disease-driving mechanism and an explanation for RAG off-target cleavage observed in humans. Our results explain the genetic basis for clonal evolution of an ETV6-RUNX1 preleukemic clone to pB-ALL after infection exposure and offer the possibility of novel therapeutic approaches.

Notably, the lung is the most common site for the first distant recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The identification of novel biomarkers for lung metastasis is of great importance to improving the outcome of TNBC. In this study, we sought to identify a microRNA (miRNA)-based biomarker and therapeutic target for lung metastasis of TNBC. METHODS: A total of 669 patients without de novo stage IV TNBC were recruited for this study. miRNA profiling was conducted in the discovery cohort. Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic values of candidate miRNAs were evaluated in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The biological functions of candidate miRNAs, as well as potential targets, were further evaluated through bioinformatic analysis as well as by performing in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS: In the discovery set, we found that miR-629-3p was specifically upregulated in both metastatic foci (fold change 144.16, P < 0.0001) and primary tumors (fold change 74.37, P = 0.004) in patients with lung metastases. In the training set, the ROC curve showed that miR-629-3p yielded high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating patients with lung metastasis from patients without recurrence (AUC 0.865, 95% CI 0.800-0.930, P < 0.0001). Although miR-629-3p predicted poor overall survival and disease-free survival in the validation set, it failed to show significance after multivariate analysis. Notably, logistic regression analyses confirmed that miR-629-3p was an independent risk factor for lung metastasis (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.5-6.6, P < 0.001). Inhibition of miR-629-3p drastically attenuated the viability and migration of TNBC cells, and it markedly suppressed lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we identified the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), a well-known metastatic suppressive gene, to be a direct target of miR-629-3p.

In this study, we aimed to determine the underlying transcriptional mechanisms regulating these inhibitory pathways. Specifically, we investigated the role of transcription factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1) in T cell response and transcriptional regulation of TIGIT and PD-1 in AML. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples collected from patients with AML were used in this study. Blimp-1 expression was examined by flow cytometry. The correlation of Blimp-1 expression to clinical characteristics of AML patients was analyzed. Phenotypic and functional studies of Blimp-1-expressing T cells were performed using flow cytometry-based assays. Luciferase reporter assays and ChIP assays were applied to assess direct binding and transcription activity of Blimp-1. Using siRNA to silence Blimp-1, we further elucidated the regulatory role of Blimp-1 in the TIGIT and PD-1 expression and T cell immune response. RESULTS: Blimp-1 expression is elevated in T cells from AML patients. Consistent with exhaustion, Blimp-1(+) T cells upregulate multiple inhibitory receptors including PD-1 and TIGIT. In addition, they are functionally impaired manifested by low cytokine production and decreased cytotoxicity capacity. Importantly, the functional defect is reversed by inhibition of Blimp-1 via siRNA knockdown. Furthermore, Blimp-1 binds to the promoters of PD-1 and TIGIT and positively regulates their expression.

Nitidine chloride, a naturally occurring alkaloid, has been identified to possess antitumor activity. However, the effects of nitidine chloride on acute myeloid leukemia cells and its underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanism of the anti-leukemic effects of nitidine chloride. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nitidine chloride treatment for 48 consecutive hours exhibited a timedependent and dose-dependent growth inhibition activity against AML cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, nitidine chloride downregulated Cyclin B1, CDK1 and Bcl-2, upregulated p27 and Bax, inactivated PARP, activated Caspase-3 in AML cells. We further demonstrated that growth inhibition activity of nitidine chloride in AML cells is partially via inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggest that nitidine chloride could be an effective therapeutic agent against AML via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'ERK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'nitidine chloride']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '933301178Z (nitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence of an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) emerged in Phase III studies with a median incidence of approximately 6%. The mechanism remains unknown, but inhibition of a cardioprotective pathway has been proposed. Ibrutinib induces a platelet function defect, increasing the bleeding risk of anticoagulation for AF stroke prophylaxis. Multiple potential drug interactions are an added complication. In this review we examine the characteristics and management of the reported cases of AF with ibrutinib and where possible make recommendations. The evidence suggests dose reduction or temporary suspension of drug, are feasible alternative to discontinuation. The optimum choice of thromboprophylaxis has not been determined, but we propose the use of novel anticoagulants (NOACs) and avoidance of anti-platelet agents where possible.

Epub 2017 May 10.,"The fluorescence-guided photothermal therapy (FPTT) has great potential in cancer treatment. However, the conventional FPTT has to be stimulated by external light, which tends to increase background noise and leads to the inaccurate infrared light irradiation for PTT. In this study, upconverting and persistent luminescent nanocarriers (UPLNs) loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UPLNs@mSiO2) were first designed to solve the problem mentioned above. The UPLNs cores can effectively reduce the short-lived autofluorescence interference by exerting the delay time between signal acquisition and pulsed excitation light. For testing the luminescence properties, the indotcyanine green (ICG) as photothermal agent was encapsulated into the UPLNs@mSiO2. The experimental results showed that the UPLNs@mSiO2 nanoparticles could significantly reduce the short-lived autofluorescence interference and improve signal-to-noise ratio during FPTT. Our data suggest that UPLNs@mSiO2 may be a promising tool for improving the accuracy of PTT in vivo.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

However, toxicity because of methotrexate (MTX) occurs frequently. Variety in the occurrence of toxicity is partly determined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions. Recently, five SNPs in non-coding pre-microRNAs and microRNA processing (miRNA) genes were identified in association with MTX-induced oral mucositis. This study aimed to replicate the association of these miRNA variants in relation to MTX-induced oral mucositis in a prospective childhood ALL cohort. Three out of five SNPs with a minor allele frequency more than 0.15 [CCR4-NOT transcription complex (CNOT4) rs3812265, miR-1206 rs2114358, miR-2053 rs10505168] were analyzed in 117 pediatric ALL patients treated with 5 g/m MTX (DCOG ALL-10). Oral mucositis was defined as grade more than or equal to 3 according to the National Cancer Institute criteria. rs2114358 in miR-1206 was associated with oral mucositis [odds ratio (OR): 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-11.5], whereas we did not confirm the association of CNOT4 rs3812265 (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.27-1.80) and miR-2053 rs10505168 (OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 0.76-8.24).

The most serious adverse effects of dexamethasone among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are osteonecrosis and thrombosis. To identify inherited genomic variation involved in these severe adverse effects, we carried out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by analyzing 14 pleiotropic glucocorticoid phenotypes in 391 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the Projection Onto the Most Interesting Statistical Evidence integrative analysis technique to identify genetic variants associated with pleiotropic dexamethasone phenotypes, stratifying for age, sex, race, and treatment, and compared the results with conventional single-phenotype GWAS. The phenotypes were osteonecrosis, central nervous system toxicity, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, thrombosis, dexamethasone exposure, BMI, growth trajectory, and levels of cortisol, albumin, and asparaginase antibodies, and changes in cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins after dexamethasone. RESULTS: The integrative analysis identified more pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphism variants (P=1.46x10(-215), and these variants were more likely to be in gene-regulatory regions (P=1.22x10(-6)) than traditional single-phenotype GWAS. The integrative analysis yielded genomic variants (rs2243057 and rs6453253) in F2RL1, a receptor that functions in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation, which were associated with pleiotropic effects, including osteonecrosis and thrombosis, and were in regulatory gene regions.

The first salvage therapy used post-relapse was donor cell therapy (DCT) (second alloHSCT or donor lymphocyte infusion) in 75, re-induction chemotherapy (CT) in 103, radiotherapy in 8 and interferon-alpha in 6. Although re-induction CT death rate was low (2%), survival after CT was inferior to DCT (HR 1.9, P < 0.001). No survival benefit was seen for patients who developed GVHD following salvage therapy (P = 0.405). CONCLUSION: Patients with AML who relapse beyond 6 months from alloHSCT without prior grade 3-4 acute GVHD have a better outcome from salvage therapy. Salvage treatments employing DCT as the initial treatment of AML relapse confer a survival advantage over CT.",['(c) 2017 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*allogeneic transplantation', '*relapse']",,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5751-6900', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6783-2301']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group conducted a prospective phase II study of pretransplant zoledronic acid (ZA) and individualised post-transplant ZA to prevent bone loss in alloSCT recipients. Patients received ZA 4 mg before conditioning. Administration of post-transplant ZA from days 100 to 365 post alloSCT was determined by a risk-adapted algorithm based on serial bone density assessments and glucocorticoid exposure. Of 82 patients enrolled, 70 were alive and without relapse at day 100. A single pretransplant dose of ZA prevented femoral neck bone loss at day 100 compared with baseline (mean change -2.6+/-4.6%). Using the risk-adapted protocol, 42 patients received ZA between days 100 and 365 post alloSCT, and this minimised bone loss at day 365 compared with pretransplant levels (mean change -2.9+/-5.3%). Femoral neck bone loss was significantly reduced in ZA-treated patients compared with historical untreated controls at days 100 and 365. This study demonstrates that a single dose of ZA pre-alloSCT prevents femoral neck bone loss at day 100 post alloSCT, and that a risk-adapted algorithm is able to guide ZA administration from days 100 to 365 post transplant and minimise further bone loss.",,,,,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In healthy tissue, PRAME expression is limited to the testes and ovaries, making it a highly attractive cancer target. PRAME is an intracellular protein that cannot currently be drugged. After proteasomal processing, the PRAME300-309 peptide ALYVDSLFFL (ALY) is presented in the context of human leukocyte antigen HLA-A*02:01 molecules for recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR) of cytotoxic T cells. Here, we have described Pr20, a TCR mimic (TCRm) human IgG1 antibody that recognizes the cell-surface ALY peptide/HLA-A2 complex. Pr20 is an immunological tool and potential therapeutic agent. Pr20 bound to PRAME+HLA-A2+ cancers. An afucosylated Fc form (Pr20M) directed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against PRAME+HLA-A2+ leukemia cells and was therapeutically effective against mouse xenograft models of human leukemia. In some tumors, Pr20 binding markedly increased upon IFN-gamma treatment, mediated by induction of the immunoproteasome catalytic subunit beta5i. The immunoproteasome reduced internal destructive cleavages within the ALY epitope compared with the constitutive proteasome. The data provide rationale for developing TCRm antibodies as therapeutic agents for cancer, offer mechanistic insight on proteasomal regulation of tumor-associated peptide/HLA antigen complexes, and yield possible therapeutic solutions to target antigens with ultra-low surface presentation.",,,,"['R01 CA055349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA062948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA200327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-A*01:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A1 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",PMC5490756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2017 Sep 1;127(9):3557.

Rituximab (Mabthera((R)), Roche Products Ltd) targets the CD20 antigen, which is expressed at low levels in CLL. The standard dose of rituximab in CLL (375 mg/m(2) in cycle 1 and 500 mg/m(2) in cycles 2-6) was selected based on toxicity data only. Small doses of rituximab (as low as 20 mg) have biological activity in CLL, with an immediate reduction in circulating CLL cells and down-regulation of CD20. Phase II trials had suggested improved efficacy with the addition of mitoxantrone to FCR. The key assumption for the Attenuated dose Rituximab with ChemoTherapy In CLL (ARCTIC) trial was that the addition of mitoxantrone to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and low-dose rituximab would be more effective than conventional FCR. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone and low-dose rituximab (FCM-miniR) (100 mg of rituximab per cycle) was non-inferior to FCR in frontline CLL. Complete response (CR) rate was the primary end point, with the secondary end points being progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate, eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD), safety and cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: ARCTIC was a UK multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, Phase IIB non-inferiority trial in previously untreated CLL. A total of 206 patients with previously untreated CLL who required treatment, according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia criteria, were to be randomised to FCR or FCM-miniR. There was an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) with a pre-planned interim efficacy assessment on 103 participants. RESULTS: The DMEC's interim analysis led to early trial closure. Although the response rates in both arms were higher than anticipated, FCM-miniR had a lower CR rate than FCR. This was partly attributable to the higher toxicity associated with mitoxantrone. A total of 100 participants completed FCR, 79 completed FCM-miniR and 21 commenced FCM-miniR but switched to FCR following DMEC recommendations. The CR rate for participants receiving FCR was 76%, compared with 55% for FCM-miniR (adjusted odds ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.73). Key secondary end points also showed that FCR was superior, with more participants achieving MRD negativity (57% for FCR vs. 46% for FCM-miniR). More participants experienced a serious adverse reaction with FCM-miniR compared with FCR (50% vs. 41%). At a median of 37.3 months' follow-up, the PFS and OS rates are good compared with previous studies, with no significant difference between the treatment arms. The economic analysis indicates that because FCM-miniR is less effective than FCR, FCM-miniR is not expected to be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon, producing a mean cost-saving of - pound7723, a quality-adjusted life-year loss of -0.73 and a resulting incremental net monetary loss of - pound6780. CONCLUSIONS: FCM-miniR is less well tolerated, with poorer response rates, than FCR, partly owing to the additional toxicity associated with mitoxantrone. In view of this, FCM-miniR will not be taken forward into a larger definitive Phase III trial. The trial demonstrated that oral FCR yields extremely high response rates compared with historical series with intravenous chemotherapy. FUTURE WORK: We shall compare the results of ARCTIC with those of the ADMIRE (Does the ADdition of Mitoxantrone Improve Response to FCR chemotherapy in patients with CLL?) trial, which compared FCR with FCM-R to assess the efficacy of low- versus standard-dose rituximab, allowing for the toxicity associated with mitoxantrone.

We also compare ibrutinib with other kinase inhibitors and chemoimmunotherapy regimens using data from clinical trials. A literature search utilized the PubMed database. Expert opinion: Despite the efficacy and tolerability of ibrutinib, important questions remain, which include selection of patients receiving ibrutinib in the first and subsequent lines of treatment, optimal dosing, sequential use of ibrutinib versus other kinase inhibitors and combination therapy.

It infers poor prognosis in AML patients; however, its prognostic value in APL is still controversial. We aimed to assess the distribution and prognostic value of FLT3-ITD mutation within AML subgroups, focusing on APL. METHODS: In NCI, Cairo University, 346 newly diagnosed AML patients were included. Morphological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analysis were done at presentation and fixed follow-up points with monitoring in follow up visits of patients. FLT3-ITD mutations were detected using RT-PCR. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 18.5% of AML patients with significant higher incidence in M3 patients (35.5%, p = 0.027) in comparison to other types. There was significant negative association between FLT3ITD mutations and CD34 expression (p = 0.026). FLT3 wild patients had a significantly better response on Day 35 than the mutant group (p = 0.046). Overall Survival (OS) of the wild group was significantly better than that of the mutant group (p = 0.003). In APL patients, OS of wild-FLT3 patients was significantly better than of those with mutant FLT3 (p = 0.018). In non-APL patients, favorable cytogenetic changes - t(8;21) and inv(16) - are more common in FLT3 wild group (12.8%) than in FLT3 mutant group (6.3%). In non-APL patients, FLT3-ITD mutation retained its adverse prognostic effect (p = 0.016). CD34 expression affected survival in both FLT3 mutant and wild groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FLT3-ITD mutations infer poor prognostic effects both in AML patients generally and in the APL group specifically. CD34 may have a prognostic impact in FLT3-ITD mutant patients, which is to be further investigated.",,,,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 29.,"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T-cell neoplasm with a dismal prognosis. It is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus. A long latency period from HTLV-1 infection to ATL onset suggests that not only HTLV-1 proteins, such as Tax and HBZ, but also additional genetic and/or epigenetic events are required for ATL development. Although many studies have demonstrated the biological functions of viral genes, alterations of cellular genes associated with ATL have not been fully investigated. Recently, a large-scale integrated genetic analysis revealed the entire landscape of somatic aberrations in ATL. This neoplasm is characterized by frequent gain-of-function alterations in components of the T-cell receptor/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, including activating mutations in the PLCG1, PRKCB, CARD11 and VAV1 genes, and CTLA4-CD28 and ICOS-CD28 fusions. Importantly, molecules associated with immune surveillance, such as HLA-A/B, CD58 and FAS, are affected recurrently. Among them, one notable lesion occurs as frequent structural variations that truncate the PD-L1 3'-untranslated region, leading to its overexpression. Other genetic targets include transcription factors (IRF4, IKZF2, and GATA3) and chemokine receptors (CCR4, CCR7 and GPR183), which are functionally relevant in normal T cells. A substantial proportion of ATL cases show widespread accumulation of repressive epigenetic changes, such as trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 and DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands, which coordinately modulate multiple pathways, including Cys2-His2 zinc finger genes involved in silencing retroelements. Here we review the current understanding of the genetic/epigenetic aberrations in ATL, focusing on their relevance in its molecular pathogenesis.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Microvesicles released from human embryonic stem cell derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hESCMSCMVs) might play an important part in antitumor activity. Microvesicles were isolated by ultracentrifugation and identified under a scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope separately. After 48-h cocultured with hESCMSCs and hESCMSCMVs, the number of K562 and HL60 was counted and tumor cell viability was measured by CCK8 assay. The expression of proteins Bcl-2 and Bax were estimated by western blotting. Transmission electron microscope and western blot analysis were adopted to evaluate the autophagy level. Results showed that both hESCMSCs and hESCMSCMVs inhibited proliferation of leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner. hESCMSCMVs reduced the ratio of Bcl/Bax, enhanced the protein level of Beclin-1 and LC3-II conversion, thus upregulating autophagy and apoptosis. In conclusion, microvesicles released from human embryonic stem cell derived-mesenchymal stem cells inhibited tumor growth and stimulated autophagy and excessive autophagy might induce apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 9.,"5-aza2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell differentiation by demethylating various genes, including tumor suppressor genes, transcription factors, and genes encoding cell cycle inhibitors. Although it has demonstrated efficacy in the clinic, drug resistance following 5Aza treatment occurs. Cell migration and invasion following 5Aza treatment are considered to be the key factors underlying drug resistance; however, there is currently limited information regarding the detailed mechanisms involved. In the present study, the THP1 monocytic leukemia cell line was employed. The antileukemic functions of 5Aza in THP1 cells were first investigated. The results demonstrated that 5Aza induced differentiation and inhibited THP1 cell growth. Notably, 5Aza significantly promoted THP1 cell migration. Using reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction, Western blot and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay analyses, 5Aza treatment was observed to upregulate the expression of chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) in THP1 cells. In addition, the results demonstrated that CCL2 induced extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation by CCR2 in 5Azatreated THP1 cells. Treatment with a CCR2 or ERK inhibitor inhibited the 5Azainduced increase in THP1 cell migration. In conclusion, the results of the present study provide an insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the 5Azainduced increase in THP1 cell migration, as well as a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance in AML therapy.",,,,,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Receptors, CCR2)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As hepatic inflammation is one of the causes of liver fibrosis, in the present study, we investigated the hepatoprotective effects of hSAP against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury. Our data indicated that hSAP attenuated hepatic histopathological abnormalities and significantly decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory factor expression. Moreover, CCl4-induced apoptosis in the mouse liver was inhibited by hSAP, as measured by terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and cleaved caspase-3 expression. hSAP significantly restored the expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl)-2 and suppressed the expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in vivo. The number of hepatocytes in early apoptosis stained with Annexin V was significantly reduced by 28-30% in the hSAP treatment group compared with the CCl4 group, and the expression of Bcl-2 was increased, whereas the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly inhibited in the hSAP pre-treatment group compared with the CCl4 group. hSAP administration also inhibited the migration and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in CCl4-injured liver and suppressed the activation of isolated primary HSCs induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in vitro. Collectively, these findings suggest that hSAP exerts a protective effect againts CCl4-induced hepatic injury by suppressing the inflammatory response and hepatocyte apoptosis, potentially by inhibiting HSC activation.",,,,"['R01 DK099205/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK111866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Serum Amyloid P-Component)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)']",PMC5504991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEK is reported as an oncogene in various cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, bladder cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular cancer. However, its role in cervical cancer has not been well studied. In our study, we confirmed the DEK protein as an oncoprotein in cervical cancer tissues which is correlated to cervical cancer FIGO staging and tumor type. Moreover, in vitro loss of DEK inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We proved that silencing DEK downregulated Wnt/beta-catenin and MMP-9, and silencing DEK increased GSK-3beta activity via regulating its phosphorylation instead of translation. Silencing DEK reduced p-Ser9-GSK-3beta and increased p-Tyr216-GSK-3beta, which resulted in beta-catenin degradation. Finally, the xenograft model in nude mice proved that silencing DEK impaired cervical cancer cell tumorigenicity. This research unveiled the function of DEK in tumorigenesis and metastasis via the DEK/p-Ser9-GSK-3beta/p-Tyr216-GSK-3beta/beta-catenin axis in cervical cancer and gave insights into DEK-targeting therapy for patients suffering from cervical cancer.",,,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated LSD1, and histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4)me1 and H3K4me2 expression in patients with MCL and silenced LSD1 in JeKo1 and MOLT4 cells, in order to define its role in JeKo1 and MOLT4 cell proliferation and apoptosis. We retrospectively analyzed the protein expression of LSD1, and mono- and dimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1 and H3K4me2), and cyclin D1 and Ki67 in 30 cases of MCL by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of LSD1, H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 with Ki67 was determined by statistical analysis. LSD1 was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell apoptosis and cell proliferation were detected by flow cytometry and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The protein expression levels of LSD1, histone methylated H3K4, histone acetylated H3, cyclin D1, apoptotic proteins, p15 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were examined by western blot analysis. We demonstrated that LSD1 was upregulated, and that H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 were downregulated in the cases with MCL, compared to those with proliferative lymphadenitis (p<0.05). LSD1 positively correlated with Ki67 in MCL [Cohen's kappa (kappa)=0.667, p<0.01]. There was no significant correlation between H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and Ki67 (kappa=-0.182, p>0.05, kappa=-0.200, p>0.05). The silencing of LSD1 decreased the levels of the apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2, pro-caspase-3 and C-myc, and decreased those of DNMT1 and increased p15, and resulted in the loss of cell viability and the induction apoptosis. The silencing of LSD1 increased the expression of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and histone acetylated H3 in the JeKo1 and MOLT4 cells. LSD1 siRNA also decreased cyclin D1 expression in the JeKo1 cells. On the whole, our findings demonstrate that the overexpression of LSD1 may be associated with the pathogenesis in MCL. We demonstrated that the silencing of LSD1 is capable of removing the mono- and dimethyl groups from H3K4, and upregulating the histone acetylation of H3 in JeKo1 and MOLT4 cells. The silencing of LSD1 inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis.

Epub 2017 Jun 13.,"The disruption of estrogen signaling is widely associated with the development of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers. As a multifunctional mediator of carcinogenesis, metadherin (MTDH)/astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) overexpression has been associated with numerous types of cancer, with reported roles in tumor initiation, proliferation, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. At the molecular level, MTDH has been shown to interact with proteins that drive tumorigenesis, including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF), BRCA2- and CDKN1A (p21Cip1/Waf-1/mda-6)-interacting protein alpha (BCCIPalpha) and staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1). Through the analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive endometrial and breast cancers, we found that over 25% of all gene expression correlated with MTDH. Using Affymetrix microarrays, we characterized the differences in gene expression between estrogen-treated parental and MTDH-deficient endometrial and breast cancer cells. We also explored a possible interaction between MTDH and ER by immunoprecipitation, and found that MTDH and ER associated in both breast and endometrial cancer cells in response to estrogen. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that acute estrogen stimulation promoted the interaction of MTDH with ER in the nucleus. These data, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first evidence that MTDH and ERalpha interact in the nucleus with estrogen treatment to regulate gene expression.",,,,"['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA099908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA184101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (MTDH protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",PMC5504974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 13.,"BACKGROUND: One genomic breakpoint can result in variable BCR-ABL1 transcript types due to alternative splicing. The influence of different BCR-ABL1 transcript types on clinical outcome is still controversial. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this analysis was to determine the impact of transcript type on response, clinical outcome, recurrence risk after treatment with Imatinib mesylate in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients. METHODS: Sixty CML patients in chronic phase were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and banding standard protocols. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in collective incidence of complete cytogenetic response (CCR) between the e14a2 and e13a2 groups (P=0.04). The median time to achieve CCR was shorter in e14a2 patients than to e13a2 (P=0.01). This finding is paralleled by the molecular response where the median of the BCR-ABL1/ABL1 expression levels were significantly lower in e14a2 transcript compared to e13a2 type at 3, 6, 9 and 12months from the start of therapy (P<0.01). The probability of recurrence after treatment discontinuation was 9.33 fold higher in e13a2 transcript, that is reported here for the first time (chi(2)=5.49; P=0.01; OR: 9.33; 95% CI: 1.59, 54.67). No significant difference was observed regarding overall survival (OS), although Patients with e14a2 transcript displayed a significant tendency toward a higher event free survival (EFS) ratio (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: We found that patients with the e14a2 transcript achieved better and faster responses to Imatinib mesylate. In this study, parallel data regarding molecular and cytogenetic responses, impact of transcript type on the probability of recurrence might suggest a general outcome that the type of transcript can be used as a prognostic marker at diagnosis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These liposomes were specially designed to recognise and kill B-LSCs in vitro, and to decrease non-specific cytotoxicity to untargeted cells. Hm2E8b-NCTD-liposomes selectively ablated B-LSCs through targeting hepatic leukaemia factor (HLF), which is implicated in haematopoietic stem cell regulation and is overexpressed in LSCs. Hm2E8b-NCTD-liposomes decreased HLF protein levels and induced apoptosis in the HAL-01 cell line harbouring the oncoprotein E2A-HLF. This resulted in modulation of the expression of several molecules that govern survival pathways, including HLF, SLUG, NFIL3 and C-Myc, thereby causing the induction of p53 and the mitochondrial caspase cascade. Therefore, the potent in vitro effect of Hm2E8b-NCTD-liposomes on B-LSC activity and survival pathways have the potential to be exploited clinically with appropriate drug combinations.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hm2E8b', '*immunoliposome', '*leukaemia stem cells', '*norcantharidin', '*targeting']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Liposomes)', '8452E71EO7 (norcantharidin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: 1) Examine effects of a 4-week mixed-modality supervised exercise program (4 times a week, twice a day) on fatigue in adults with acute leukemia undergoing induction chemotherapy. 2) Evaluate effects of exercise program on cognition, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. 3) Evaluate effect of intervention on adherence to exercise. METHODS: 17 adults (8 intervention, 9 control), aged 28-69 years, newly diagnosed with acute leukemia were recruited within 4 days of admission for induction treatment. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (fatigue, cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, mental health, and physical health) and fitness performance-based measures (Timed Up and Go [TUG], Karnofsky Performance Status, and composite strength scoring) were assessed at baseline and at discharge. Changes in PRO and performance-based physical function measures from baseline to time of discharge were compared between groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. RESULTS: With PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Fatigue, we found a median change in fatigue (-5.95) for the intervention group, which achieved a minimally important difference that is considered clinically relevant. Intervention group reduced their TUG performance by 1.73 seconds, whereas the control group remained fairly stable. A concerning finding was that cognition decreased for both groups during their hospitalization. 80% adherence of visits completed with a mean of 6 sessions attended per week.

Recent genome-wide sequencing studies have identified frequent mutations in genes encoding members of the cohesin complex. Mutations in cohesin contribute to myeloid malignancies by conferring enhanced self-renewal of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells but the mechanisms behind this phenotype have not been fully elucidated. Of note, cohesin mutations are highly prevalent in acute megakaryocytic leukemia associated with Down syndrome (DS-AMKL), where they occur in over half of patients. Evidence suggests that cohesin mutations alter gene expression through changes in chromatin accessibility and/or aberrant targeting of epigenetic complexes.

Eligible patients had low/intermediate-1 risk MDS, hemoglobin 10 g/dl, low transfusion burden and serum erythropoietin (EPO) 500 mU/ml. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 24 weeks of subcutaneous darbepoetin alfa 500 mug or placebo every 3 weeks (Q3W), followed by 48 weeks of open-label darbepoetin alfa. A total of 147 patients were randomized, with median hemoglobin of 9.3 (Q1:8.8, Q3:9.7) g/dl and median baseline serum EPO of 69 (Q1:36, Q3:158) mU/ml. Transfusion incidence from weeks 5-24 was significantly lower with darbepoetin alfa versus placebo (36.1% (35/97) versus 59.2% (29/49), P=0.008) and erythroid response rates increased significantly with darbepoetin alfa (14.7% (11/75 evaluable) versus 0% (0/35 evaluable), P=0.016).

We recently proposed that DNA replication stress results in MLLbcr cleavage via endonuclease G (EndoG) and represents the common denominator of genotoxic therapy-induced MLL destabilization. Here we performed a siRNA screen for new factors involved in replication stress-induced MLL rearrangements employing an enhanced green fluorescent protein-based reporter system. We identified 10 factors acting in line with EndoG in MLLbcr breakage or further downstream in the repair of the MLLbcr breaks, including activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), previously proposed to initiate MLLbcr rearrangements in an RNA transcription-dependent mechanism. Further analysis connected AID and EndoG in MLLbcr destabilization via base excision repair (BER) components. We show that replication stress-induced recruitment of EndoG to the MLLbcr and cleavage are AID/BER dependent. Notably, inhibition of the core BER factor Apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 protects against MLLbcr cleavage in tumour and human cord blood-derived haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, harbouring the cells of origin of leukaemia. We propose that off-target binding of AID to the MLLbcr initiates BER-mediated single-stranded DNA cleavage, which causes derailed EndoG activity ultimately resulting in leukaemogenic MLLbcr rearrangements.",,,,,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2461-6729'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 19.,"Mutations in the epigenetic regulator gene EZH2 are frequently observed in patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN; 10-13%) and are associated with a poor outcome. To gain more insight into EZH2 pathology, we sought to genetically characterize a cohort of 41 EZH2-mutated MDS/MPN patients using targeted deep next-generation sequencing (NGS), colony-forming progenitor assays and transcriptome analysis. Stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated downregulation of EZH2 was performed in MDS-derived F-36P, MOLM-13 and OCI-M2 cells to study EZH2-specific changes. Targeted NGS revealed a complex pattern of mutations with a total of 190 individual mutations. EZH2 mutations frequently co-occur with TET2 (58%), RUNX1 (40%) and ASXL1 (34%) mutations. Colony assays indicated EZH2 mutations to be mostly early events in leukemogenesis and showed a complex mutational hierarchy. Gene expression data revealed a number of differently expressed genes between EZH2 wild-type and mutant patients including known EZH2 targets.

However, the underlying mechanisms in vivo are not well known. Investigation of irf8-mutant zebrafish in this study indicated that Irf8 is evolutionarily conserved as an essential neoplastic suppressor through tight control of the proliferation and longevity of myeloid cells. Surviving irf8 mutants quickly developed a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-like disease with enhanced output of the myeloid precursors, which recurred after transplantation. Multiple molecules presented notable alteration and Mertk signaling was aberrantly activated in the hematopoietic cells in irf8 mutants. Transgenic mertk overexpression in Tg(coro1a:mertk) zebrafish recapitulated the myeloid neoplasia-like syndrome in irf8 mutants. Moreover, functional interference with Mertk, via morpholino knockdown or genetic disruption, attenuated the myeloid expansion phenotype caused by Irf8 deficiency. Therefore, Mertk signaling is a critical downstream player in the Irf8-mediated regulation of the progression of myeloid neoplasia.

Here we explored the potential of targeting Mcapital EF, Cyrillics, by using colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)-blocking mAbs, to treat myeloma. Our results showed that CSF1R blockade specifically inhibited the differentiation, proliferation and survival of murine M2 Mcapital EF, Cyrillics and MAMs, and repolarized MAMs towards M1-like Mcapital EF, Cyrillics in vitro. CSF1R blockade alone inhibited myeloma growth in vivo, by partially depleting MAMs, polarizing MAMs to the M1 phenotype, and inducing a tumor-specific cytotoxic CD4(+) T-cell response. Similarly, genetically depleting Mcapital EF, Cyrillics in myeloma-bearing MM(DTR) mice retarded myeloma growth in vivo. Furthermore, the combination of CSF1R blockade and chemotherapy such as bortezomib or melphalan displayed an additive therapeutic efficacy against established myeloma. Finally, a fully human CSF1R blocking mAb, similar to its murine counterpart, was able to inhibit the differentiation, proliferation and survival of human Mcapital EF, Cyrillics. Thus, this study provides the first direct in vivo evidence that MPhis and MAMs are indeed important for myeloma development and progression. Our results also suggest that targeting MAMs by CSF1R blocking mAbs may be promising methods to (re)sensitize myeloma cells to chemotherapy and promote anti-myeloma immune responses in patients.",,,,"['R01 CA200539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD018205/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Csf1r protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",PMC5927777,['NIHMS956091'],,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6141-0068'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 16.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic disease and the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The mechanisms underlying drug resistance in AML are poorly understood. Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are the most common molecular abnormality in AML. Quizartinib (AC220) is a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of FLT3. It is in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive and -negative AML patients and as maintenance therapy. To understand the mechanisms of drug resistance to AC220, we undertook an unbiased approach with a novel CRISPR-pooled library to screen new genes whose loss of function confers resistance to AC220. We identified SPRY3, an intracellular inhibitor of FGF signaling, and GSK3, a canonical Wnt signaling antagonist, and demonstrated reactivation of downstream FGF/Ras/ERK and Wnt signaling as major mechanisms of resistance to AC220. We confirmed these findings in primary AML patient samples. Expression of SPRY3 and GSK3A was dramatically reduced in AC220-resistant AML samples, and SPRY3-deleted primary AML cells were resistant to AC220. Intriguingly, expression of SPRY3 was greatly reduced in GSK3 knockout AML cells, which positioned SPRY3 downstream of GSK3 in the resistance pathway. Taken together, our study identified novel genes whose loss of function conferred resistance to a selective FLT3 inhibitor, providing new insight into signaling pathways that contribute to acquired resistance in AML.

From initial therapy to endless relapse-related treatment, societal burden is felt not only in the context of healthcare cost, but also in the compromised quality of life of patients. Long-term therapeutic strategies have become the standard in keeping hematological malignancies at bay as these cancers develop resistance to each round of therapy with time. As a result, there is a continual need for the development of new drugs to combat resistant disease in order to prolong patient life, if not to produce a cure. This review aims to summarize advances in targeting lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma through both cutting-edge and well established platforms. Current standard of treatment will be reviewed for these malignancies and emphasis will be made on new therapy development in the areas of antibody engineering, epigenetic small molecule inhibiting drugs, vaccine development, and chimeric antigen receptor cell engineering. In addition, platforms for the delivery of these and other drugs will be reviewed including antibody-drug conjugates, micro- and nanoparticles, and multimodal hydrogels.

We used oligo-based array CGH (oaCGH) analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 24-color karyotyping to enhance the characterization of the JT. G-banding detected a JT involving the 3q13.3-qter chromosomal segment and the recipient chromosomal regions 17p, 8q, and 15q. Each clone with JT was associated with trisomy 8. oaCGH analysis revealed an additional submicroscopic deletion in 3q13.31 as well as small subtelomeric duplications on several chromosomes. Locus-specific FISH with BAC-based probes from the 3q13.31-q13.32 region showed great heterogeneity. Telomere FISH revealed significantly reduced telomeric content in the aberrant cells with JT compared with cytogenetically normal cells at diagnosis and in normal cells at complete remission. A literature search revealed two previous de novo AML-M5 cases of JT involving the 3q13.3-qter chromosomal segment and concomitant trisomy 8. In addition, a case with an unbalanced der(Y)t(Y;3)(q12;q13.31) and additional trisomy 8 was previously reported in a patient with de novo AML-M5. All of these cases had a dismal outcome.

Analysis of 111 human CTCL and control samples revealed extensive chromatin signatures that distinguished leukemic, host, and normal CD4(+) T cells. We identify three dominant patterns of transcription factor (TF) activation that drive leukemia regulomes, as well as TF deactivations that alter host T cells in CTCL patients. Clinical response to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) is strongly associated with a concurrent gain in chromatin accessibility. HDACi causes distinct chromatin responses in leukemic and host CD4(+) T cells, reprogramming host T cells toward normalcy.

Historically, CD117 has been an important asset in the diagnosis of patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). In an attempt to simplify the diagnosis of MPAL with fewer and more lineage specific markers, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed in 2008 a new criteria for the diagnosis of this type of AL, which excluded CD117 from the myeloid markers that are utilized to diagnose MPAL. In order to assess whether CD117 is necessary in the diagnosis of MPAL, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of CD117 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 331 patients with AL. The calculated sensitivity of CD117 for AML was 85.88% (103/120), while the specificity was 83.9% (177/211). Besides myeloperoxidase (MPO), which was used as the gold standard in differentiating AML from other type of ALs, the most specific markers for AML in our study were CD14 and CD64 (99.5 and 95.6%). Although the specificity of CD117 in this study is not as high as CD14 and CD64, markers concomitantly used in this this study and in the WHO classification, based on the results of other researches (i.e. the specificity of CD117 for AML was 100% in one study) and due to the fact that its specificity for AML in this study is relatively high, we recommend the use CD117 in assigning a myeloid lineage in MPAL.",['Copyright (c) 2017 IMSS.

It is well recognized that MPN patients carry an excessive risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. However, little is known about the prevalence of these clonal markers in patients with cerebral vascular disease. METHODS: To address this issue, 153 consecutive stroke patients in Taiwan were enrolled in the study. Allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR), real-time AS-PCR, and Illumina paired-end sequencing were employed to detect the presence of MPL, JAK2V617F, and CALR exon 9 mutations, respectively. RESULTS: JAK2V617F mutation was detectable in 13 samples (8.5%), but the allele burdens (AB) were greater than 1% in only six (3.9%) of them. Compared to JAK2-unmutated patients, those with JAK2V617F AB &gt; 1% had significantly higher white blood count (p = 0.01), although four of the six did not exhibit MPN phenotypes. Two patients had a heterozygous CALR exon9 mutation locating outside the coding region and did not alter the amino acid sequence of this protein. On the other hand, there were no patients carrying the MPL mutations. Using patient age, baseline hemogram, and stroke-relevant risk factors, we developed a predictive model that could successfully identify stroke patients at risk of carrying clonal JAK2V617F mutation. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of JAK2V617F mutation in stroke patients was higher than that seen in general population. Based on our newly developed probability stratification model, genotyping of JAK2V617F mutation in selected patients with stroke might be warranted.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ET', '*Ischemic stroke', '*JAK2V617F', '*PMF', '*genetic association studies', '*myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*patients', '*stroke']",,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 17.,"The relative merits of reduced intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIST) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the first chronic phase (CP) in imatinib era have not been evaluated. The study was designed to compare the outcomes of combination therapy of RIST plus imatinib (RIST + IM) vs. imatinib (IM) alone for young patients with early CP (ECP) and late CP (LCP). Of the patients, 130 were non-randomly assigned to treatment with IM alone (n = 88) or RIST + IM (n = 42). The 10-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were comparable between RIST + IM and IM groups. LCP, high Sokal score, and no complete cytogenetic response at 3 months were adverse prognostic factors for survival, but only the time from diagnosis to IM was an independent predictor after multivariate analysis. For ECP, IM was similar to RIST + IM, with 10-year EFS rates of 77.2 vs. 81.6% (p = 0.876) and OS rates of 93.8 vs. 87.9% (p = 0.102), respectively. For LCP, both treatments resulted in similar survival, but more patients in the imatinib group experienced events (10-year EFS 40.8 vs. 66.7%, p = 0.047). The patients with higher EBMT risk scores had an inferior survival than those with lower scores (69.2 vs. 92.9%, p = 0.04). We concluded that RIST + IM was comparable to IM in terms of OS and EFS. However, RIST + IM was more affordable than IM alone in a 10-year scale. Thus, RIST + IM could be considered as an alternative treatment option, especially when the patients have low EBMT risk scores and demand a definite cure for CML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Late chronic phase', 'Reduced intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 1.,"Three-quarters of the patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), show numerical or structural chromosomal alterations, which are important factors in leukemogenesis. The use of Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probes Amplification (MLPA) has been mainly limited for searching copy number alterations of genes, suggesting that MLPA could detect numerical alterations in cancer. However, the use of MLPA in pediatrics to analyze subtelomeric sequences for aneuploidy detection has not been considered in previous studies. The aim of this study was to identify aneuploidy for the first time using MLPA and correlate the results with karyotype and DNA-index (DI), from preB ALL patients. Forty-two bone marrow samples were analyzed by cytogenetics and flow cytometry to determine the DI. The chromosomal gains and/or losses were detected by the SALSA MLPA P036 Subtelomere Mix 1 probemix((R)). The chromosomal number matched in 36 out of 42 samples between MLPA and karyotype (R(2)=0.7829, p=3.7x10(-10)), 18/42 between MLPA and DI (R(2)=0.1556, p=0.023), and 20/42 between karyotype and DI (R(2)=0.1509, p=0.015). MLPA results correlated with karyotype and DI. The use of MLPA led us to identify a gained marker chromosome. Our results indicate that MLPA could be a useful and fast alternative tool for aneuploidy identification in pediatric leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2017 May 10.,"INTRODUCTION: Insurance status has been found to influence treatment outcomes in various solid tumors. Limited data with conflicting results are available in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We examined the impact of health insurance at diagnosis on AML treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive adult patients (>/= 18 years of age) diagnosed with AML between 2002 and 2011 and followed through August 2013 were included. Survival estimates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Logistic regression and multivariate Cox proportional hazards methods were used to explore the influence of multiple baseline covariates on treatment outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients with complete medical records were identified. Of these, 161 patients had complete cytogenetic/molecular data for risk stratification and were included in the final efficacy analyses. Most patients (45.8%) were publicly insured, 36.3% were privately insured, and 17.3% were uninsured. No significant association was found between insurance source and cytogenetic/molecular risk status. Transplantation information was available for 157 patients, with no significant association found between transplant receipt and insurance source. After adjustment for age, cytogenetic/molecular risk, and transplant receipt, we found no statistically significant association between the insurance source and either event-free or overall survival. CONCLUSION: Insurance source at diagnosis has no impact on AML treatment outcomes. The consistency of our results with some, but not all, studies is probably driven primarily by access-to-care eligibility requirements among different states. Further efforts to better understand such disparities are warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2017 May 10.,"BACKGROUND: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounts for about 15% of pediatric ALL. With wider use of intensive chemotherapy, the prognosis for childhood T-ALL has improved. Further gains in treatment outcome will likely require methods to identify patients who continue to fail on contemporary protocols. This study aimed to evaluate pediatric patients with T-ALL at 2 different Arabic cancer centers regarding their clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all children with T-ALL treated between 2003 and 2013 at 2 oncology centers in the Middle East. Patients were divided into (group I) treated with Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-90 treatment protocol between February 2003 and June 2007 and (group II) includes all patients treated thereafter by the Total Therapy Study XIII protocol for high-risk ALL. RESULTS: This study included 103 patients with a median age of 8.9 years. The male to female ratio was 2.6:1. The median initial white blood cell count was 123 x 10(9)/L. Central nervous system leukemia was detected in 15%. The early T-cell precursor (ETP)-ALL phenotype was found in 16.5%. The 5-year overall survival was 20.7% +/- 67.5% and 72.9% +/- 5.7% (P < .01); the 5-year disease-free survival was 47.1% +/- 13.8% and 77.3% +/- 6.0% (P = .023); and the 5-year event-free survival was 28.6% +/- 12.1% and 71.1% +/- 6.2% (P = .003) for group I and II, respectively. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients with T-ALL significantly improved in patients who received the treatment protocol of ALL with high-risk criteria. This protocol eliminates the bad outcomes effect of several clinical and immunophenotypic markers. Patient with the ETP-ALL phenotype had a nonsignificant inferior outcome compared with the non-ETP-ALL group.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether in vitro exposure to permethrin and malathion induces aberrations in genes involved in the etiology of these hematological malignancies. Genetic abnormalities in the IGH, KMT2A (MLL), ETV6 and RUNX1 genes, and aneuploidy induced by the in vitro exposure to permethrin and malathion (200muM, 24h), were analyzed by FISH in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The gene fusions IGH-BCL2, KMT2A-AFF1 and ETV6-RUNX1 were further analyzed with nested RT-PCR in PBMCs, and in K562 cells exposed to acute and chronic treatments (0.1muM, 24h or every third day for two weeks) of insecticides. FISH analysis revealed that permethrin induces aneuploidy and structural alterations in IGH and KMT2A genes, and malathion induces breaks in KMT2A. RT-PCR detected ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in PBMCs acutely exposed to permethrin. Permethrin also induced ETV6-RUNX1 and IGH-BCL2 fusions in K562 cells, and malathion induced KMT2A-AFF1 and ETV6-RUNX1 fusions.

It is a natural sesquiterpene and has been the subject of numerous studies. However, the effects of TC on vascular inflammation remain unknown. In this study, we reported that TC treatment in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) prevented attachment of monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 cells to endothelial cells. In addition, in vivo results indicate that TC inhibited macrophage infiltration to the aortic surface and reduced total serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Importantly, administration of TC could inhibit the induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, our data indicate that the inhibitory effects of TC on the expression of VCAM-1 are mediated by the JAK2/STAT1/IRF-1 pathway. TC is a specific agonist of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R). Importantly, we further verified that the inhibitory effects of TC on the expression of IRF-1 and VCAM-1 are dependent on activation of CB2R. Inhibition of CB2R by either specific inhibitors or RNA interference abolished the inhibitory effects of TC on the expression of IRF-1 and VCAM-1.

Epub 2017 May 8.,"Introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia treatment is associated with a 63% probability of maintaining a complete cytogenetic response, meaning that over 30% patients require an alternative methodology to overcome resistance, tolerance, or side effects. Considering the potential of nanotechnology in cancer treatment and the benefits of a combined therapy with imatinib, a nanoconjugate was designed to achieve BCR-ABL1 gene silencing. Gold nanoparticles were functionalized with a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide that selectively targets the e14a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript expressed by K562 cells. This gold (Au)-nanoconjugate showed great efficacy in gene silencing that induced a significant increase in cell death. Variation of BCL-2 and BAX protein expression, an increase of caspase-3 activity, and apoptotic bodies in cells treated with the nanoconjugate demonstrate its aptitude for inducing apoptosis on K562 BCR-ABL1-expressing cells. Moreover, the combination of the silencing Au-nanoconjugate with imatinib prompted a decrease of imatinib IC50. This Au-nanoconjugate was also capable of inducing the loss of viability of imatinib-resistant K562 cells. This strategy shows that combination of Au-nanoconjugate and imatinib make K562 cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy and that the Au-nanoconjugate alone may overcome imatinib-resistance mechanisms, thus providing an effective treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia patients who exhibit drug tolerance.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

This mutation accounts largely for the onset of myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS). For this reengineering, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mammalian cell lines that express truncated versions of the Gata1s protein similar to that seen in ML-DS, as determined by analyzing specific genetic alterations resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage. During this work, 73 cell lines were clonally expanded, with allelic variance analyzed. Using Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition (TIDE) and Sanger sequencing, we defined the DNA sequence and variations within each allele. We found significant heterogeneity between alleles in the same clonally expanded cell, as well as among alleles from other clonal expansions. Our data demonstrate and highlight the importance of the randomness of resection promoted by non-homologous end joining after CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage in cells undergoing genetic reengineering. Such heterogeneity must be fully characterized to predict altered functionality inside target tissues and to accurately interpret the associated phenotype. Our data suggest that in cases where the objective is to rearrange specific nucleotides to redirect gene expression in human cells, it is imperative to analyze genetic composition at the individual allelic level.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

However, therapeutic benefits were compromised due to vector-induced dysregulation of cellular genes and leukemia development in a subset of patients. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins act as cellular cofactors that tether the murine leukemia virus (MLV) pre-integration complex to host chromatin via interaction with the MLV integrase (IN) and thereby define the typical gammaretroviral integration distribution. We engineered next-generation BET-independent (Bin) MLV vectors to retarget their integration to regions where they are less likely to dysregulate nearby genes. We mutated MLV IN to uncouple BET protein interaction and fused it with chromatin-binding peptides. The addition of the CBX1 chromodomain to MLV INW390A efficiently targeted integration away from gene regulatory elements. The retargeted vector produced at high titers and efficiently transduced CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells, while fewer colonies were detected in a serial colony-forming assay, a surrogate test for genotoxicity. Our findings underscore the potential of the engineered vectors to reduce the risk of insertional mutagenesis without compromising transduction efficiency. Ultimately, combined with other safety features in vector design, next-generation BinMLV vectors can improve the safety of gammaretroviral vectors for gene therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Here, we present a case with nasal and bone marrow involvement, provide a literature review and make a differential diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old male presented nasal congestion pharyngalgia, palatal perforation, high fever and multiorgan dysfunction. Our diagnosis primarily relied on clinical features, the morphology and immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells and imaging studies. Characteristic large granular lymphocytes with azurophilic granules were visible in the bone marrow smears. In addition, the neoplastic cells expressed a typical immunophenotype, and the T cell receptor gamma (TCR-gamma) gene rearrangement analysis and presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative. The patient's symptoms and signs were temporarily relieved after chemotherapy treatment, but after a short time, he underwent a rapid clinical decline and died 8 weeks later after admission due to multiorgan function failure. CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that to avoid a misdiagnosis, bone marrow analyses and other examinations should be performed early when a patient initially presents nasal lesions and other systemic symptoms.

Epub 2017 Jun 17.,"BACKGROUND: Vincristine (VCR) induced peripheral neuropathy is a common complication in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURES: A retrospective data analysis over an interval of 10 years (2006-2016) of all children with ALL seen at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital was carried out. Electronic medical records of eligible patients were reviewed. Patients with clinical evidence of neuropathy and abnormal nerve conduction studies (NCSs) were included in the study. RESULTS: Nineteen (nine females and 10 males) out of 103 pediatric patients developed VCR-related neuropathy, and their age ranged between 2.5 and 14 years. Symptoms started after 2-11 doses of VCR. All 19 patients had documented peripheral neuropathy on NCSs. The autonomic nervous system and cranial nerves affection was relatively common in our patients; two presented with bradycardia, two patients with unexplained tachycardia, and five had abdominal pain and constipation, complicated by typhlitis in two patients. One patient developed unilateral hearing loss. Two patients developed severe life-threatening cranial nerve involvement with bilateral ptosis and recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement presented as vocal cord paralysis, hoarseness of voice, frequent chocking, and aspiration episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral neuropathy was the commonest form of VCR-related neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy was relatively common in our patients.

PML is caused by John Cunningham (JC) polyomavirus, and predominantly affects patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other immunocompromised patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in establishing the diagnosis of PML. MRS with long and short echo time was performed in two patients with PML associated with HIV infection and in one PML patient associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The most prominent peak on the obtained spectra was for lactate; it showed 2-3 times higher concentration of lactate compared to choline, almost 4-6 times higher lactate concentration compared to creatine, and 4-11 times higher lactate in comparison to N-acetylaspartate concentration. Similar spectrum pattern was observed in all patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new finding that might be useful in early diagnosis of PML. Nevertheless, further confirmation of our results is needed, since we analyzed the spectrum pattern only in three patients. Overall, our results could help in early detection of PML, especially in non-HIV patients, and thus prevent the fatal outcome of the disease.

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and multi-drug resistant Protein 4 (MRP4) have both been associated with mercaptopurine toxicity in clinical studies, but their relative contributions remain unclear. METHODS: We studied the metabolism of and tolerance to mercaptopurine in murine knockout models of Tpmt, Mrp4, and both genes simultaneously. RESULTS: Upon mercaptopurine treatment, Tpmt (-/-) Mrp4 (-/-) mice had the highest concentration of bone marrow thioguanine nucleotides (8.5 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, P = 7.8 x 10(-4) compared with 2.7 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells in wild-types), followed by those with Mrp4 or Tpmt deficiency alone (6.1 and 4.3 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, respectively). Mrp4-deficient mice accumulated higher concentrations of methylmercaptopurine metabolites compared with wild-type (76.5 vs. 23.2 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, P = 0.027). Mice exposed to a clinically relevant mercaptopurine dosing regimen displayed differences in toxicity and survival among the genotypes. The double knock-out of both genes experienced greater toxicity and shorter survival compared to the single knockout of either Tpmt (P = 1.7 x 10(-6)) or Mrp4 (P = 7.4 x 10(-10)).

Elevation of cAMP using forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP), BAY60-6583 or Cicaprost induced rapid cytoskeleton remodelling and inhibited proliferation and migration in VSMCs but not EC. Furthermore, elevated cAMP inhibited mitogen-induced nuclear-translocation of MKL1 and MKL2 in VSMCs but not ECs. Forskolin also significantly inhibited serum response factor (SRF)-dependent reporter gene (SRE-LUC) activity and mRNA expression of pro-proliferative and pro-migratory MKL1/2 target genes in VSMCs but not in ECs. In ECs, MKL1 was constitutively nuclear and MKL2 cytoplasmic, irrespective of mitogens or cAMP. Pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of MKL1 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of VSMC and EC.

In this manuscript we review the crosstalk between the Casein Kinase II (CK2) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) pathways that plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular proliferation in leukemia. Both CK2 and GSK-3 are potential targets for anti-leukemia treatment. Previously published data suggest that CK2 and GSK-3 act synergistically to promote the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway via phosphorylation of PTEN. More recent data demonstrate another mechanism through which CK2 promotes the PI3K pathway - via transcriptional regulation of PI3K pathway genes by the newly-discovered CK2-Ikaros axis. Together, these data suggest that the CK2 and GSK-3 pathways regulate AKT/PI3K signaling in leukemia via two complementary mechanisms: a) direct phosphorylation of PTEN and b) transcriptional regulation of PI3K-promoting genes. Functional interactions between CK2, Ikaros and GSK3 define a novel signaling network that regulates proliferation of leukemia cells. This regulatory network involves both direct posttranslational modifications (by CK and GSK-3) and transcriptional regulation (via CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ikaros).

Epub 2017 Jun 13.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL oncoprotein in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are remarkably effective inducing deep molecular remission in most patients. However, they are less effective to eradicate the leukemic stem cells (LSC), resulting in disease persistence. Therefore, there is great need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to specifically target the LSC. In an experimental mouse CML model system, the leukotriene pathway, and specifically, the expression ALOX5, encoding 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), has been reported as a critical regulator of the LSC. Based on these results, the 5-LO inhibitor zileuton has been introduced in clinical trials as a therapeutic option to target the LSC although its effect on primary human CML LSC has not been studied. We have here by using multiplex single cell PCR analyzed the expression of the mediators of the leukotriene pathway in bone marrow (BM) BCR-ABL(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells at diagnosis, and found low or undetectable expression of ALOX5. In line with this, zileuton did not exert significant overall growth inhibition in the long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) and colony (CFU-C) assays of BM CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from 7 CML patients. The majority of the single leukemic BCR-ABL(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells expressed cysteinyl leukotriene receptors CYSLT1 and CYSLT2. However, montelukast, an inhibitor of CYSLT1, also failed to significantly suppress CFU-C and LTC-IC growth. These findings indicate that targeting ALOX5 or CYSLT1 signaling with leukotriene antagonists, introduced into the clinical practice primarily as prophylaxis and treatment for asthma, may not be a promising pharmacological strategy to eradicate persisting LSC in CML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

Epub 2017 Jun 13.,"Recently, it has been suggested that imatinib (IM) and nilotinib (NIL) could be studied beyond their original application, as inhibitors of the drug efflux pump ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1). Since the reversal of ABCB1-mediated resistance has never been successfully demonstrated in the clinic, we addressed the question of whether IM and NIL may actually serve as efficient inhibitors of ABCB1. Here we define an efficient inhibitor as a compound that achieves full (90-100%) reversal of drug efflux at a concentration that does not exhibit significant off-target toxicity in vitro. In this study, human leukemia K562 cells expressing various levels of ABCB1 were used. We observed that cells expressing higher ABCB1 levels required higher concentrations of IM and NIL to achieve full reversal of drug efflux. Among the well-known ABCB1 inhibitors, a similar effect was found for cyclosporin A (CsA) but not for zosuquidar. IM was efficient only in cells with the low and moderate ABCB1 expression at high concentrations that were cytotoxic in the absence of Bcr-Abl. In contrast, NIL was as efficient an inhibitor of ABCB1 as CsA. Low and moderate expression levels of ABCB1 could be efficiently inhibited by NIL concentrations without cytotoxic effects in the absence of Bcr-Abl. However, high expression levels of ABCB1 required higher NIL concentrations with off-target cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, application of NIL, but not of IM, in clinics is promising, however, only in cells with low ABCB1 expression levels. We hypothesize that some patients may benefit from an inhibitor exhibiting an ABCB1 expression-dependent effect.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Older adults (age >/= 66 years) who had been diagnosed with CMML from 2001 to 2011 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, and propensity score matching was used to match patients who had been diagnosed after HMA approval (2007-2011) and had received HMA treatment with patients diagnosed before HMA approval (2001-2003). Cox proportional hazards models with the matched sample were used to assess the change in OS. A second matched cohort of patients who did not receive HMA after approval and patients diagnosed before HMA approval was used to evaluate survival change attributable to other potential differences between the 2 time periods, such as improved supportive care. RESULTS: Among 1378 older adults diagnosed with CMML, the median OS was 13 months, and 18.8% received HMAs. In the primary matched analysis, with 225 HMA users diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 395 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003, the median OS times were 17 and 11 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.91; P = .005). In a secondary analysis, the risk of death did not differ between 395 propensity score-matched HMA nonusers diagnosed in 2007-2011 and 484 patients diagnosed in 2001-2003 (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91-1.32; P = .34). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited evidence, HMAs are commonly used to treat older CMML patients. The use of HMAs was associated with a 28% reduction in the risk of death in adjusted analyses. Improvements in supportive care do not appear to account for temporal improvements in OS. Cancer 2017;123:3754-3762.

Epub 2017 Jun 16.,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe immune activation and dysregulation resulting in extreme and often life-threatening inflammation. HLH has been well recognized in pediatric populations, and most current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are based on pediatric HLH. Recently there has been recognition of HLH in adults, especially secondary to immune deregulation by an underlying rheumatologic, infectious, or malignant condition. This review is focused on malignancy-associated HLH (M-HLH), in which possible mechanisms of pathogenesis include severe inflammation, persistent antigen stimulation by the tumor cells, and loss of immune homeostasis because of chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or infection. Previously considered rare, M-HLH may occur in up to 1% of patients with hematologic malignancies. M-HLH is often missed or diagnosed late in most published studies, and it has been associated with a poor median survival of less than 2 months. Identification of the clinical and laboratory features specific to M-HLH in adults may allow early detection, consultation with HLH experts, and intervention. Improved management of adult M-HLH with optimal combinations of T-lympholytic and immunosuppressive agents and the incorporation of novel agents based on the pediatric experience hopefully will improve outcomes in adults with M-HLH.

The cell culture system he established in the early 1960s for the clonal development of normal hematopoietic cells, made it possible to discover the proteins that regulate the viability, proliferation and differentiation of different blood cell lineages, the molecular basis of normal hematopoiesis and the changes that drive leukemia. His studies established significant general concepts including: a) the value of a multi-gene cytokine network in regulating the viability, number and development of different cell types; b) the existence of alternative pathways that give flexibility to development in both normal and cancer cells; c) the response of some cancer cells to normal regulators of development; d) suppression of myeloid leukemia by inducing differentiation, bypassing malignancy-driving genetic defects; e) identification of chromosomes that control tumor suppression; f) discovering apoptosis as a major mechanism by which WT-p53 suppresses malignancy and g) the ability of hematopoietic cytokines to suppress apoptosis in both normal and leukemic cells. It is gratifying that Leo had the good fortune to witness his pioneering discoveries and ideas move from the basic science stage to effective clinical applications, augmenting normal hematopoiesis in patients with various hematopoietic deficiencies, in patients requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in the suppression of malignancy by inducing differentiation and apoptosis.",,,,,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Sachs L'],"['Sachs, Leo']"

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity caused by several chemotherapeutic agents. Currently, CIPN is managed by empirical dose modifications at the discretion of the treating physician. The goal of this research is to quantitate the dose-CIPN relationship to inform the optimal strategies for dose modification. Data were obtained from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40502 trial, a randomized phase III trial of paclitaxel vs. nab-paclitaxel vs. ixabepilone as first-line chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. CIPN was measured using a subset of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) scale. A kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-PD) model was utilized to quantitate the dose-CIPN relationship simultaneously for the three drugs. Indirect response models with linear and Smax drug effects were evaluated. The model was evaluated by comparing the predicted proportion of patients with CIPN (score >/=8 or score >/=12) to the observed proportion. An indirect response model with linear drug effect was able to describe the longitudinal CIPN data reasonably well. The proportion of patients that were falsely predicted to have CIPN or were falsely predicted not to have CIPN was 20% or less at any cycle. The model will be utilized to identify an early time point that can predict CIPN at later time points. This strategy will be utilized to inform dose adjustments to prospectively manage CIPN.

There are rare reports of clonally rearranged T and B cell receptors in dogs with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our objective was to determine the frequency of clonally rearranged T and B cell receptors in dogs with AML. Archived slides from historical cases of AML (from January 2010 to June 2013) and slides or liquid specimens [blood, bone marrow (BM), body cavity fluid, or tissue aspirates] from cases of AML diagnosed between June 2013 and February 2017 were used in the study. A diagnosis of AML was made on the basis of more than 20% immature neoplastic cells (""blasts"") in blood, BM, or extramedullary tissues, displaying features of myeloid differentiation. Myeloid differentiation was based on a combination of morphologic criteria, positive flow cytometric labeling for surface antigens typical of myeloid origin (e.g., CD11b, CD11c, CD14 with a general lack of expression of T or B cell markers), or positive cytochemical staining reactions for myeloid-associated enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, chloroacetate esterase). There were 63 cases of AML diagnosed during this period; however, slides or liquid specimens with sufficient DNA for testing were only obtained from 25 dogs. Affected dogs represented various breeds and were a median of 8 years old, with more male (64%) than female (36%) dogs. Common clinical signs were peripheral or internal lymphadenopathy (10/25 dogs, 40%) and hepatomegaly or splenomegaly (10/25 dogs combined, 40%). Typical hematologic findings were bi- or pancytopenia (23/25 dogs, 92%), with circulating blasts (21/25, 84%). Solitary clonal (4 B cell, 6 T cell) and biclonal (6 B and T cell) rearrangements in B or T cell receptors were found in 16 dogs (64%). Our results indicate that dogs with AML can have a high frequency of clonally rearranged T or B cell receptors, including biclonality, and clonality testing should not be used as a tool to distinguish between acute leukemia of myeloid or lymphoid origin.",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'canine', 'clonality testing', 'cytochemistry', 'flow cytometry', 'leukemia', 'phenotyping', 'polymerase testing for antigen receptor rearrangements']",,,PMC5449502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Front Vet Sci. 2017 Nov 14;4:195.

Median age at T0 was 62 years (range 31-87); 61% were males. The median duration between diagnosis and T0 was 3.1 years. The median number of lines of therapy before T0 was 4 (range 3-13). The median overall survival (OS) from T0 for the entire cohort was 13 (95% confidence interval (CI) 11, 15) months. At least one regimen recorded after T0 in 462 (85%) patients, with a median (95% CI) progression-free survival and OS from T0 of 5 (4, 6), and 15.2 (13, 17) months, respectively. The study provides the expected outcome of relapsed multiple myeloma that is refractory to a PI and an IMiD, a benchmark for comparison of new therapies being evaluated.",,,,,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)']",,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5392-9284', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1797-8657', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7715-4548', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8986-8436']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF1 is a genetic syndrome first manifesting in childhood; affecting multiple organs, childhood development, and neurocognitive status; and presenting the clinician with often complex management decisions that require a multidisciplinary approach. Molecular genetic testing (see article for detailed discussion) is recommended to confirm NF1, particularly in children fulfilling only pigmentary features of the diagnostic criteria. Although cancer risk is not the major issue facing an individual with NF1 during childhood, the condition causes significantly increased malignancy risks compared with the general population. Specifically, NF1 is associated with highly elevated risks of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor as well as substantial risks of noninvasive pilocytic astrocytoma, particularly optic pathway glioma (OPG), which represent a major management issue. Until 8 years of age, clinical assessment for OPG is advised every 6 to 12 months, but routine MRI assessment is not currently advised in asymptomatic individuals with NF1 and no signs of clinical visual pathway disturbance. Routine surveillance for other malignancies is not recommended, but clinicians and parents should be aware of the small risks (<1%) of certain specific individual malignancies (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma). Tumors do contribute to both morbidity and mortality, especially later in life. A single whole-body MRI should be considered at transition to adulthood to assist in determining approaches to long-term follow-up. Clin Cancer Res; 23(12); e46-e53.

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"The bone marrow (BM) provides a protective microenvironment to support the survival of leukemic cells and influence their response to therapeutic agents. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the high rate of relapse may in part be a result of the inability of current treatment to effectively overcome the protective influence of the BM niche. To better understand the effect of the BM microenvironment on drug responses in AML, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 304 inhibitors, including approved and investigational agents, comparing ex vivo responses of primary AML cells in BM stroma-derived and standard culture conditions. In the stroma-based conditions, the AML patient cells exhibited significantly reduced sensitivity to 12% of the tested compounds, including topoisomerase II, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The loss of TKI sensitivity was most pronounced in patient samples harboring FLT3 or PDGFRB alterations. In contrast, the stroma-derived conditions enhanced sensitivity to Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Increased cell viability and resistance to specific drug classes in the BM stroma-derived conditions was a result of activation of alternative signaling pathways mediated by factors secreted by BM stromal cells and involved a switch from BCL2 to BCLXL-dependent cell survival. Moreover, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib restored sensitivity to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in AML patient cells ex vivo in different model systems and in vivo in an AML xenograft mouse model. These findings highlight the potential of JAK inhibitors to counteract stroma-induced resistance to BCL2 inhibitors in AML.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4324-8706'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the genetic abnormality, a dysregulated immune system also has an important role in the pathogenesis of B-ALL. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) represent one of the key drivers in immune tolerance against tumor cells, including various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The role of MDSCs in B-ALL remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that the granulocytic (G)-MDSC population was significantly elevated in both the peripheral blood and BM of patients with B-ALL, when compared with age-matched healthy controls. G-MDSCs levels correlated positively with clinical therapeutic responses and B-ALL disease prognostic markers, including minimal residual disease, and the frequencies of CD20(+) and blast cells.

One of the effects of Lyn's action is spatial and functional segregation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 into two pools, one beneath the plasma membrane in an active state promoting pro-survival signals, the other in the cytosol in an inhibited conformation and unable to counter the elevated level of cytosolic tyrosine phosphorylation. We herein show that SHP-1 activity can be elicited directly by nintedanib, an agent also known as a triple angiokinase inhibitor, circumventing the phospho-S591-dependent inhibition of the phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of pro-apoptotic players such as procaspase-8 and serine/threonine phosphatase 2A, eventually triggering apoptosis. Furthermore, the activation of PP2A by using MP07-66, a novel FTY720 analog, stimulated SHP-1 activity via dephosphorylation of phospho-S591, which unveiled the existence of a positive feedback signaling loop involving the two phosphatases. In addition to providing further insights into the molecular basis of this disease, our findings indicate that the PP2A/SHP-1 axis may emerge as an attractive, novel target for the development of alternative strategies in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",['Copyright(c) 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,"['0 (Indoles)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'G6HRD2P839 (nintedanib)']",PMC5541874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is widely overexpressed in cancer cells and necessary for maintenance of malignant phenotypes. Hsp90 inhibition induces tumor cell death through degradation of its client oncoproteins and has shown promises in preclinical studies. However, the mechanism by which Hsp90 inhibitors kill tumor cells is not well-understood. Biomarkers associated with differential sensitivity and resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors remain to be identified. In this study, we found that colorectal cancer cells containing inactivating mutations of FBW7, a tumor suppressor and E3 ubiquitin ligase, are intrinsically insensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors. The insensitive colorectal cancer cells lack degradation of Mcl-1, a prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein. Hsp90 inhibition promotes GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of Mcl-1, which subsequently binds to FBW7 and undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Specifically blocking Mcl-1 phosphorylation by genetic knock-in abrogates its degradation and renders in vitro and in vivo resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors, which can be overcame by Mcl-1-selective small-molecule inhibitors. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a key role of GSK3beta/FBW7-dependent Mcl-1 degradation in killing of colorectal cancer cells by Hsp90 inhibitors and suggest FBW7 mutational status as a biomarker for Hsp90-targeted therapy.

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most frequent types of blood malignancies. It is a complex disorder of undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells. The majority of patients generally respond to intensive therapy. Nevertheless, relapse is the major cause of death in AML, warranting the need for novel treatment strategies. Retinoids have demonstrated potent differentiation and growth regulatory effects in normal, transformed, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the paradigm of treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia, an AML subtype. The majority of AML subtypes are, however, resistant to ATRA. Multiple synthetic retinoids such as ST1926 recently emerged as potent anticancer agents to overcome such resistance. Despite its lack of toxicity, ST1926 clinical development was restricted due to its limited bioavailability and rapid excretion. Here, we investigate the preclinical efficacy of ST1926 and polymer-stabilized ST1926 nanoparticles (ST1926-NP) in AML models. We show that sub-mumol/L concentrations of ST1926 potently and selectively inhibited the growth of ATRA-resistant AML cell lines and primary blasts. ST1926 induced-growth arrest was due to early DNA damage and massive apoptosis in AML cells. To enhance the drug's bioavailability, ST1926-NP were developed using Flash NanoPrecipitation, and displayed comparable anti-growth activities to the naked drug in AML cells. In a murine AML xenograft model, ST1926 and ST1926-NP significantly prolonged survival and reduced tumor burden. Strikingly, in vivo ST1926-NP antitumor effects were achieved at four fold lower concentrations than the naked drug. These results highlight the promising use of ST1926 in AML therapy and encourage its further development. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(10); 2047-57.

We modified BET bromodomain inhibitors, an epigenetic-based therapy, to create functionally conserved compounds that are amenable to click chemistry and can be used as molecular probes in vitro and in vivo. We used click proteomics and click sequencing to explore the gene regulatory function of BRD4 (bromodomain containing protein 4) and the transcriptional changes induced by BET inhibitors. In our studies of mouse models of acute leukemia, we used high-resolution microscopy and flow cytometry to highlight the heterogeneity of drug activity within tumor cells located in different tissue compartments. We also demonstrate the differential distribution and effects of BET inhibitors in normal and malignant cells in vivo. This study provides a potential framework for the preclinical assessment of a wide range of drugs.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with low numeracy have difficulties with understanding complex graphs. Combining the information-processing approach to numeracy with graph comprehension and information-reduction theories, we examined whether high numerates' better comprehension might be explained by their closer attention to task-relevant graphical elements, from which they would expect numerical information to understand the graph. Furthermore, we investigated whether participants could be trained in improving their attention to task-relevant information and graph comprehension. DESIGN: In an eye-tracker experiment ( N = 110) involving a sample from the general population, we presented participants with 2 hypothetical scenarios (stomach cancer, leukemia) showing survival curves for 2 treatments. In the training condition, participants received written instructions on how to read the graph. In the control condition, participants received another text. We tracked participants' eye movements while they answered 9 knowledge questions. The sum constituted graph comprehension. We analyzed visual attention to task-relevant graphical elements by using relative fixation durations and relative fixation counts. RESULTS: The mediation analysis revealed a significant ( P < 0.05) indirect effect of numeracy on graph comprehension through visual attention to task-relevant information, which did not differ between the 2 conditions. Training had a significant main effect on visual attention ( P < 0.05) but not on graph comprehension ( P < 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high numeracy have better graph comprehension due to their greater attention to task-relevant graphical elements than individuals with low numeracy. With appropriate instructions, both groups can be trained to improve their graph-processing efficiency. Future research should examine (e.g., motivational) mediators between visual attention and graph comprehension to develop appropriate instructions that also result in higher graph comprehension.",,['NOTNLM'],"['*graph comprehension', '*numeracy', '*survival curve', '*training', '*visual attention']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cafestol exhibited the highest cytotoxicity against HL60 and KG1 cells, as evidenced by the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 fraction, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, accumulation of cleaved caspase-3 and phosphatidylserine externalization. An increase in CD11b and CD15 differentiation markers with attenuated ROS generation was also observed in Cafestol-treated HL60 cells. These results were similar to those obtained following exposure of the same cell line to cytarabine (Ara-C), an antileukemic drug. Cafestol and Ara-C reduced the clonogenic potential of HL60 cells by 100%, but Cafestol spared murine colony forming unit- granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), which retained their clonogenicity. The co-treatment of Cafestol and Ara-C reduced HL60 cell viability compared with both drugs administered alone. In conclusion, despite the distinct molecular mechanisms involved in the activity of Cafestol and Ara-C, a similar cytotoxicity towards leukemia cells was observed, which suggests a need for prophylactic-therapeutic pre-clinical studies regarding the anticancer properties of Cafestol.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

When interpreting clinical trials data from these persons one must be aware of substantial selection biases. Randomized trials of post-remission treatments can be performed upfront or after achieving defined landmarks. Both strategies have important limitations. Selection of the appropriate treatment is critical. Age, performance score, co-morbidities and frailty provide useful data to treatment selection. If an intensive remission induction therapy is appropriate, therapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline is the most common regimen. Non-intensive therapies consist of the hypo-methylating drugs azacitidine and decitabine, low-dose cytarabine and supportive care. Feasibility of doing an allotransplant in older persons with AML is increasing. However, only very few qualify. Results of cytogenetic testing are risk factor in young and old persons with AML. Adverse abnormalities are more frequent in older persons. Although data about the frequency of mutations in older persons with AML is increasing their prognostic impact is less clear than in younger subjects. Neither differences in the distribution of cytogenetic risk, mutations, nor differences in clinical risk factors between younger and older persons with AML completely explain the age-dependent outcome.

Epub 2017 Jul 17.,"PURPOSE: FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is aberration associated with poor prognosis in AML. We have analyzed the expression of MDR-1, MRP-1, and BCRP mRNA in relation to FLT3-ITD in 100 AML adult patients with normal and intermediate karyotype. METHODS: The RQ-PCR method was performed to assess the expression of MDR-1, MRP-1, and BCRP mRNA, and the results were presented as coefficients calculated using an intermediate method according to Pfaffl's rule. RESULTS: According to univariate analysis, the following pretreatment variables negatively influenced disease-free survival (DFS): WBC count >/=25x10(9) /L (P=.037), MRP-1 mRNA >/=1.6818 (P=.028), BCRP mRNA >/=1.1892 (P=.004), FLT3-ITD (P=.005) and overall survival (OS): WBC count >/=25x10(9) /L (P=.031), MRP-1 mRNA >/=1.6818 (P=.01), BCRP mRNA >/=1.1892 (P=.01), FLT3-ITD (P=.001). When all prognostic variables were pooled into a multivariate model, we found that WBC count >/=25x10(9) /L (P=.026) and BCRP mRNA >/=1.1892 (P=.011). We observed trend in negative influence of FLT3-ITD on DFS (P=.057). BCRP mRNA >/=1.1892 (P=.035) and FLT3-ITD (P=.006) negatively, independently influenced the OS. CONCLUSIONS: The high expressions of BCRP mRNA calculated with Pfaffl's rule and FLT3-ITD are independent poor risk factors in adult patients with AML and intermediate or normal karyotype.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,"Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the drug of choice for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in Nigeria. Several studies have established interindividual and interpopulation variations in imatinib disposition although no pharmacokinetic study have been conducted in an African population since the introduction of the drug. This study explored a population pharmacokinetic approach to investigate the disposition of imatinib in Nigerians and examined the involvement of some covariates including genetic factors in the variability of the drug disposition with a view to optimize the use of the drug in this population. A total of 250 plasma concentrations from 126 chronic myeloid leukemia patients were quantified using a validated method. A population pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the data using NONMEM VII software, and the influences of 12 covariates were investigated. The mean population-derived apparent steady-state clearance, elimination half-life, area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours, and volume of distribution were 17.2 +/- 1.8 L/h., 12.05 +/- 2.1 hours, 23.26 +/- 0.6 mug.h/mL, and 299 +/- 20.4 L, respectively. Whole blood count, ethnicity, CYP3A5*3, and ABCB1 C3435T were found to have significant influence on the apparent clearance, while the interindividual variability in clearance and interoccasion variability in bioavailability were 17.4% and 20.4%, respectively. There was a wide variability in apparent clearance and area under the curve compared to those reported in other populations. Thus, treatment with a standard dose of imatinib in this population may not produce the desired effect in most of the patients, whereas continuous exposure to a low drug concentration could lead to pharmacokinetic-derived resistance. The authors suggest the need for therapeutic drug monitoring-guided dose individualization in this population.","['(c) 2017, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1 C3435T', 'CYP3A5*3', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'genetic polymorphism', 'imatinib', 'population pharmacokinetics']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6722-1970'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"OBJECTIVE: Overexpression of ABCG2 and CD200 has been independently associated with poor outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no data are available on the role of these two factors in patients with core-binding factor (CBF)-positive or FLT3-negative/NPM1-mutated cytogenetically normal (CN) AML. METHODS: We analyzed 65 adult AML patients with CBF+ (n=16) or FLT3-/NPM1+ CN (n=49), evaluating clinical and biological factors associated with complete remission attainment, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: ABCG2 was expressed in 36 (55%) cases, and CD200 was positive in 33 (51%) cases, six at high levels. Both ABCG2 and CD200 positivity have a negative impact on relapse risk: 3-year LFS was 51% vs 82% in ABCG2+ cases (RR 3.3), 49% vs 82% in CD200+ patients (RR=4.4), and 25% in CD200- high cases (RR=17.1). ABCG2 and CD200 affected also OS with 3-year OS of 39% in ABCG2+ (compared to 71% in ABCG2-; RR=2.6) and CD200+ (compared to 68% in CD200-; RR=2.5) patients.
