Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these enzymes are also known to alter their protein expression and function. Moreover, genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure have been proposed to be an etiology of cancer. We hypothesized that polymorphisms of these enzymes might affect the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CYP 1A1, CYP 3A4*1B, CYP 3A5*3, CYP 3A5*6, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms were genotyped by using PCR-RFLP in 107 children with ALL and 320 healthy controls. Allele and genotype frequencies of each of the SNPs were compared between two groups. It was found that the allele frequencies of CYP 1A1*1, *2A, *2B, and *4 were not different between cases and controls. CYP 3A4*1B allele frequency was only 0.8% and 0.9% in ALL and controls, respectively. CYP 3A5*1/*1, *1/*3, and *3/*3 genotype frequencies showed no statistically significant difference between patients and controls. CYP 3A5*6 was not detected in our population. The GSTM1 null genotype was significantly increased in children with ALL (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0, 2.7). In contrast, the GSTT1 null genotype did not show this effect. Our data thus demonstrate that the GSTM1 null genotype might increase the risk of childhood ALL in a Thai population.","['Pakakasama, S', 'Mukda, E', 'Sasanakul, W', 'Kadegasem, P', 'Udomsubpayakul, U', 'Thithapandha, A', 'Hongeng, S']","['Pakakasama S', 'Mukda E', 'Sasanakul W', 'Kadegasem P', 'Udomsubpayakul U', 'Thithapandha A', 'Hongeng S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. rasam@mhidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20404 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Jul;79(3):202-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, release of CEV from the cell requires Abl- but not Src-family tyrosine kinases, and is blocked by STI-571 (Gleevec), an Abl-family kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in humans. Finally, we show that STI-571 reduces viral dissemination by five orders of magnitude and promotes survival in infected mice, suggesting possible use for this drug in treating smallpox or complications associated with vaccination.

This study focused on determining whether LIF inhibits differentiation of photoreceptors by altering cell fate or by blocking the expression of essential transcription factors in vivo. METHODS: Transgenic mice were generated that had lens-specific expression of the secreted human LIF protein. Retinal differentiation was assessed by histology and by gene expression analysis, with in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and real-time qRT-PCR. Electroretinograms were used to assess retinal function. RESULTS: LIF did not prevent or alter the timing of outer and inner nuclear layer separation, but it inhibited phototransduction gene expression in both rods and cones, thereby blocking functional maturation of photoreceptors. LIF also reduced the expression of Crx, Nrl, and Nr2e3, and upregulated the expression of transcription inhibitors Baf and Fiz1. CONCLUSIONS: LIF expression did not appear to alter photoreceptor cell fate specification, but it inhibited subsequent differentiation. These results suggest that gp130 ligands can inhibit photoreceptor functional differentiation by reducing Crx- and Nrl-dependent transcription.","['Graham, Dianca R', 'Overbeek, Paul A', 'Ash, John D']","['Graham DR', 'Overbeek PA', 'Ash JD']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Fiz1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nr2e3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nrl protein, mouse)', '0 (Orphan Nuclear Receptors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Rod Opsins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cone rod homeobox protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Electroretinography', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Eye Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Lens, Crystalline/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/*pathology', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rod Opsins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vision, Ocular/genetics']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['46/7/2601 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.05-0129 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2005 Jul;46(7):2601-10. doi: 10.1167/iovs.05-0129.,,"['EY10448/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY10803/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY11348/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY14206/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As an initial step toward developing an immunotherapy for intraocular tumors, the present study was conducted to examine whether injection of microvesicles expressing membrane FasL into ocular tumors (that are FasL negative) would have a similar effect. METHODS: Microvesicles expressing either no FasL or membrane-only Fas ligand were coinjected with L5178Y-R lymphoma cells into the anterior chambers (AC) of DBA/2 mice. RESULTS: Tumor cells coinjected with control vesicles grew progressively in the AC, and all mice died of metastatic disease by day 15. By contrast, a single injection of membrane FasL vesicles induced a potent inflammatory response characterized by GR1+ neutrophils and F4/80+ macrophages and significantly improved survival from 0% in untreated mice to 58% in mFasL-treated mice. Among the surviving mice, the ocular tumor was eliminated in 55%, and the mice exhibited systemic protection from a second tumor challenge. In the remaining 45%, the ocular tumor was not eliminated, but the mice were protected from liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive membrane FasL microvesicles coinjected with tumor cells induce a potent inflammatory response that terminates immune privilege, eliminates ocular tumors, and prevents metastatic disease.","['Gregory, Meredith S', 'Koh, Sean', 'Huang, Eric', 'Saff, Rebecca R', 'Marshak-Rothstein, Ann', 'Mukai, Shizuo', 'Ksander, Bruce R']","['Gregory MS', 'Koh S', 'Huang E', 'Saff RR', 'Marshak-Rothstein A', 'Mukai S', 'Ksander BR']","['Schepens Eye Research Institute, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anterior Chamber/pathology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Eye Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', '*Immunity, Innate', '*Immunotherapy', 'Keratitis/immunology', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Ligands', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['46/7/2495 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.05-0048 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2005 Jul;46(7):2495-502. doi: 10.1167/iovs.05-0048.,,"['CA-90691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-EY13664/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY08122/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We develop a mathematical framework that can be used to study the principles underlying the emergence and prevention of resistance in cancers treated with targeted small-molecule drugs. We consider a stochastic dynamical system based on measurable parameters, such as the turnover rate of tumor cells and the rate at which resistant mutants are generated. We find that resistance arises mainly before the start of treatment and, for cancers with high turnover rates, combination therapy is less likely to yield an advantage over single-drug therapy. We apply the mathematical framework to chronic myeloid leukemia. Early-stage chronic myeloid leukemia was the first case to be treated successfully with a targeted drug, imatinib (Novartis, Basel). This drug specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL oncogene, which is required for progression. Although drug resistance prevents successful treatment at later stages of the disease, our calculations suggest that, within the model assumptions, a combination of three targeted drugs with different specificities might overcome the problem of resistance.","['Komarova, Natalia L', 'Wodarz, Dominik']","['Komarova NL', 'Wodarz D']","['Department of Mathematics, 103 MSTB, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA. komarova@math.uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/09/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['0501870102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0501870102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Jul 5;102(27):9714-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0501870102.

OSM treatment induced phosphorylation of ERK, and pretreatment with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, prevented the OSM-stimulated proliferation of hATSCs, suggesting that the MEK/ERK pathway is involved in the OSM-induced proliferation. Treatment with OSM also induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and JAK3, and pretreatment of the cells with WHI-P131, a JAK3 inhibitor, but not with AG490, a JAK2 inhibitor, attenuated the OSM-induced proliferation of hATSCs. Furthermore, OSM treatment elicited phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, and pretreatment with WHI-P131 specifically prevented the OSM-induced phosphorylation of STAT1, without affecting the OSM-induced phosphorylation of ERK and STAT3.

Using microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) and DNA electrophoresis, we found that As(2)O(3) could induce the cells to undergo G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Further, it was shown that the levels of FAS and P53 proteins increased and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) decreased upon drug action by employing FCM. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected increased mRNA product of FAS and caspase-3 genes and reduced MDR1 mRNA. CASPASE-3 activity was also enhanced after As(2)O(3) treatment. However, the expression of BCL-2 protein was not affected by the drug.

In the present study, we have delineated the mechanism by which hIP induces STAT3 phosphorylations in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. Stimulation of endogenous hIP by its specific agonist, cicaprost, resulted in STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Cicaprost-induced STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations were resistant to pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment, suggesting that these responses were mediated through PTX-insensitive G proteins. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 MAPK, were shown to be phosphorylated by cicaprost in a time- and concentration-dependent manner via PTX-insensitive G proteins. The levels of the interaction between STAT3, ERK and JNK were enhanced by cicaprost treatment. The involvement of Raf-1, MEK1/2 and JNK in cicaprost-induced phosphorylations of STAT3 was illustrated by the use of their selective inhibitors. In contrast, p38 MAPK did not appear to be required. Similar observations were obtained with STAT1 upon stimulation by cicaprost. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that hIP activation by cicaprost can lead to STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylations via signaling pathways involving PTX-insensitive G proteins, ERK and JNK.","['Lo, Rico K H', 'Wise, Helen', 'Wong, Yung H']","['Lo RK', 'Wise H', 'Wong YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Neuroscience Center, and Biotechnology Research Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K8 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NE94J8CAMD (cicaprost)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epoprostenol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*physiology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/physiology', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol/agonists/*physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Serine/analysis', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/analysis']",2005/06/28 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(05)00100-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2006 Mar;18(3):307-17. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.05.001.

Applying this method to photodynamically stressed murine leukemia cells and mitochondria isolated from these cells, we identified and quantified PLOOHs derived from phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin. In terms of high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability, HPLC-EC(Hg) has a clear advantage over all other existing techniques for determining PLOOHs in complex biological systems.","['Korytowski, Witold', 'Niziolek, Magdalena', 'Girotti, Albert W']","['Korytowski W', 'Niziolek M', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow 30-387, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Glycerophospholipids)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', 'FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Electrochemistry/methods', 'Electrodes', 'Glycerophospholipids/*analysis', 'Lipid Peroxides/*analysis/radiation effects', 'Mercury/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*chemistry']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/10/18 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(05)00300-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2005 Aug 1;343(1):136-42. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.005.,,"['CA 72630/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TW 01386/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen transcripts that encoded components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system were coordinately overexpressed and stabilized in both malignant cell lines. This pathway plays an important role in regulating cell growth and the development of malignancy. Numerous additional transcripts that encode proteins involved in growth regulation, damage repair and stress responses, posttranscriptional gene expression, and mitochondrial metabolism were also coordinately up-regulated and stabilized.

However, elements of the host DNA repair machinery such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)-related protein kinase family system would play a role in the integration of viral DNA into the host DNA. Here, we show that a host PI-3K-related protein kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), plays a role in the specific integration of retroviral DNA and induction of retroviral diseases in vivo. DNA-PK-deficient scid mice inoculated with Friend leukemia virus (FLV) exhibited a random integration into their genomic DNA and expressed the viral envelope protein gp70. However, the specific integration of FLV at Spi-1 or Fli-1 sites did not occur in association with the significant resistance of scid mice to FLV-induced leukemogenesis. In contrast, the knockout of another member of the PI-3K-related protein kinase family, encoded by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, resulted in mice as sensitive to FLV-induced leukemogenesis as the wild type mice. FLV was specifically integrated into the DNA at Spi-1 and Fli-1 sites with significant expression of these transcription factors. These findings indicated that DNA-PK would be essential for controlling the in vivo integration of FLV at specific sites as well as the susceptibility to FLV-induced leukemogenesis.","['Hasegawa, Maki', 'Yamaguchi, Shuichi', 'Aizawa, Shiro', 'Ikeda, Hidetoshi', 'Tatsumi, Kouichi', 'Noda, Yuko', 'Hirokawa, Katsuiku', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Hasegawa M', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Aizawa S', 'Ikeda H', 'Tatsumi K', 'Noda Y', 'Hirokawa K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Aging and Developmental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 13-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/immunology', 'Genes, p53/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/immunology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Spleen/chemistry/immunology/virology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology', '*Virus Integration']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00063-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Aug;29(8):933-42. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.01.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise mechanism of apoptosis in such cancers has not been previously addressed. In this study, we used human Jurkat leukemia cell lines with defects in intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis induced by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We observed that Jurkat cells deficient in FADD or caspase-8 were partially resistant to apoptosis, while dominant-negative caspase-9 mutant cells were completely resistant to apoptosis. Use of caspase inhibitors confirmed these results. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 rendered the cells resistant to THC at early time points but not upon prolonged exposure. THC treatment led to loss of Deltapsi(m), in both wild-type and FADD-deficient Jurkat cells thereby suggesting that THC-induced intrinsic pathway was independent of FADD. THC treatment of wild-type Jurkat cells caused cytochrome c release, and cleavage of caspase-8, -9, -2, -10, and Bid. Caspase-2 inhibitor blocked THC-induced caspase-3 in wild-type Jurkat cells but not loss of Deltapsi(m). Together, these data suggest that the intrinsic pathway plays a more critical role in THC-induced apoptosis while the extrinsic pathway may facilitate apoptosis via cross-talk with the intrinsic pathway.","['Lombard, Catherine', 'Nagarkatti, Mitzi', 'Nagarkatti, Prakash S']","['Lombard C', 'Nagarkatti M', 'Nagarkatti PS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Virginia Campus, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dronabinol/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00061-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Aug;29(8):915-22. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.01.014.

Phorbol ester-induced maturation of K562 cells was accompanied by repositioning of down-regulated BCR/ABL genes closer to the nuclear membrane. This nuclear rearrangement could be connected with differentiation-related heterochromatinization of the amplified BCR-ABL locus, as demonstrated by increased histone H3(K9) dimethylation and decreased H3(K9) acetylation of B3A2 breakpoint. Topography of BCR/ABL in differentiated K562 cells was compared with other leukemic cell types: PMA-maturation of HL60 cells did not influence the nuclear positioning of individual BCR and ABL genes. Moreover, BCR and ABL genes in non-stimulated HL60 as well as in the bone marrow cells of CML patients, i.e. also BCR/ABL fusion genes, were positioned more interiorly in comparison with BCR/ABL multiple loci of K562 cells. Decreased expression of BCR/ABL gene was also found after cell stimulation by selectively pro-apoptotic agent etoposide and by ABL-RNAi leading to apoptosis. In order to compare the efficiency of selected experimental strategies, levels of Bcr/Abl and c-Abl proteins were determined and in all cases tested were reduced. In K562 cells the Bcr/Abl and c-Abl proteins were distributed homogeneously in both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm, while differentiation of K562 cells was characterized by a distinct pattern of Bcr/Abl and c-Abl proteins that were focally distributed rather in the cytoplasm while apoptotic population was completely absent of Bcr/Abl and c-Abl signals.","['Bartova, Eva', 'Harnicarova, Andrea', 'Pachernik, Jiri', 'Kozubek, Stanislav']","['Bartova E', 'Harnicarova A', 'Pachernik J', 'Kozubek S']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '56937-68-9 (phorbolol myristate acetate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA Interference/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00055-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Aug;29(8):901-13. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.01.011.

Using bisulfite PCR methods, we have explored the prevalence of methylation of this pathway in a cohort of children with ALL (N=20), and compared these results with those observed in a group of adult patients (N=53). P73 was methylated in 4 (20%) pediatric patients, P15 in 3 (15%), and P57KIP2 in 2 (10%). These compared to 14 (26%), p=0.5, 16 (30%), p=0.04 and 20 (37%), p=0.04, respectively in adult patients. Methylation of two or more genes was not observed in any pediatric patient, but in 15 (28%) adult patients (p=0.003). Poor survival of adult patients was associated with methylation of > or =2 genes (p=0.003). These results indicate that differences in DNA methylation of specific molecular pathways may contribute to the prognostic differences known to occur between pediatric and adult patients with ALL.","['Canalli, Andreia A', 'Yang, Hui', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Hoshino, Koyu', 'Sanchez-Gonzalez, Blanca', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Canalli AA', 'Yang H', 'Jeha S', 'Hoshino K', 'Sanchez-Gonzalez B', 'Brandt M', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (CDKN1C protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00046-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Aug;29(8):881-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.11.023.

It is understood that before initiating cell differentiation, PMA treatment must first induce an inhibition of cell growth. Since the initial biochemical and molecular events that are associated with this growth inhibition have not been characterized, the present study was carried out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the PMA-induced growth arrest of THP-1 cells. Our results indicate that PMA inhibits THP-1 cells at G1-phase of the cell cycle, via a complex mechanism associated with the modulation of the expression of several cell cycle regulators, initiated by the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA and protein were upregulated 24 h post PMA treatment as demonstrated by ribonuclease protection assay and Western blotting, respectively. Because these cells lack functional p53, this effect was independent of p53 activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the PMA-induced activation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter was driven by the specific protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor through Sp1-binding sites. Additionally, our study demonstrates that PMA-induces the upregulation of p21 through a protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated ROS-dependent signaling mechanism involving MAP kinase activation.","['Traore, Kassim', 'Trush, Michael A', 'George, Matthew Jr', 'Spannhake, Ernst Wm', 'Anderson, Winston', 'Asseffa, Amha']","['Traore K', 'Trush MA', 'George M Jr', 'Spannhake EW', 'Anderson W', 'Asseffa A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, Howard University, Washington, DC, USA. ktraore@jhsph.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '56937-68-9 (phorbolol myristate acetate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'CDC2-CDC28 Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00045-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Aug;29(8):863-79. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.12.011.

When one drug elicits a response in tumour cells resulting in resistance to a large variety of chemically unrelated drugs, this is called multidrug-resistance (MDR). ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters contribute to drug resistance via ATP-dependent drug efflux. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by MDR1 gene, confers resistance to certain anticancer agents. The development of agents able to modulate MDR mediated by Pgp and ABC transporters remained a major goal for the past 10 years. Immunosuppressors, cyclosporin A (CSA) in particular, were shown to modulate Pgp activity in laboratory models and entered very early into clinical trials for reversal of MDR. The proof of reversing activity of CSA was found in phase II studies with myeloma and acute leukaemia. In phase III studies, the results were less convincing regarding the response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival were detected in advanced refractory myeloma. The non-immunosuppressive derivative PSC833 was then extensively studied. This compound shows 10-fold higher potency in reversal of MDR mediated by Pgp. Results from clinical trials with this modulator are still emerging and the notable finding was the need to reduce the dose of anticancer agent used in combination with it. Other effects of CSA and PSC833 on MDR have been described. These two molecules have been shown to have an action on the metabolism of ceramide which stands as second messenger of anticancer agents-induced apoptosis. PSC833 stimulates de novo ceramide synthesis and enhances cell death induced by anticancer agents, such as camptothecins and anthracyclines. In addition, ceramide glycosylation and storage in some cell lines have been described to play a crucial role in resistance to anticancer drugs. CSA is able to inhibit ceramide glucosylation and modulate MDR phenotype. The emergence of other modulators with several ABC protein targets like VX710 are of clinical interest in malignancies expressing several efflux pumps.","['Aouali, Nassera', 'Eddabra, Lahcen', 'Macadre, Jerome', 'Morjani, Hamid']","['Aouali N', 'Eddabra L', 'Macadre J', 'Morjani H']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Department of Cancer Genetique, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '3KG76X4KJK (biricodar)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis', 'Cyclosporine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/metabolism/therapeutic use']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(05)00086-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2005 Oct;56(1):61-70. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.12.010.,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Controversy exists, however, as to whether a cranial boost in addition to TBI is necessary to prevent central nervous system (CNS) recurrences in these high-risk cases. Previous national trials have included a cranial boost in the absence of data to justify its use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess risk of CNS recurrence in ALL patients treated with TBI, to identify subsets of these high-risk patients at an increased or decreased risk of CNS recurrence after TBI, and to investigate whether regimens with higher doses of cranial irradiation further reduce the risk of CNS recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Charts of 67 consecutively treated patients with ALL who received TBI before HSCT were reviewed. Data including patient demographics, clinical features at presentation, conditioning regimen, donor source, use of a cranial boost, remission stage at transplant, histologic subtype, cytogenetics, and extramedullary site of presentation were retrospectively collected and correlated with the risk of subsequent CNS recurrence. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 30 (45%) patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 8 (12%) were alive with recurrence of leukemia, 7 (10.5%) had recurrent ALL but with successful salvage, 7 (11%) died subsequent to recurrence, 14 (21%) died from complications related to HCST, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up (1.5%). Of the patients who recurred after HSCT, the relapses were hematologic in 13 (57%), CNS with or without simultaneous marrow involvement in 3 (13%), and other sites in 7 (30%). Forty-one (61%) patients did not receive an extracranial boost of irradiation with TBI. Two of these patients (4.9%) suffered CNS failures compared with 1 of 26 (3.8%) who received a cranial boost (p = 0.84). None of the 40 patients who presented only with hematologic disease developed a CNS recurrence despite the fact that only 13 of 40 of these patients received a cranial boost after TBI. Cranial boost was therefore not associated with a reduction in CNS recurrence, especially in patients with only hematologic disease at presentation for which there were no failures regardless of the use of additional cranial radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients.","['Alexander, Brian M', 'Wechsler, Daniel', 'Braun, Thomas M', 'Levine, John', 'Herman, Joseph', 'Yanik, Gregory', 'Hutchinson, Raymond', 'Pierce, Lori J']","['Alexander BM', 'Wechsler D', 'Braun TM', 'Levine J', 'Herman J', 'Yanik G', 'Hutchinson R', 'Pierce LJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/12/28 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(05)00706-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Nov 15;63(4):1191-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.04.020.

Effective strategies are needed to deal with the tolerogenic properties of many tumor antigens, and with the immunocompromised status of patients. We discuss different methods of generating tumor-specific T cells which are currently being evaluated in clinical practice, such as vaccination and adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific T cells. Finally, we shall discuss novel strategies in development, such as the adoptive transfer of T cell receptor (TCR) gene modified T cells to establish antigen-specific immunity in patients with leukemia and solid cancers. The transfer of validated high avidity TCRs, isolated from 'non-tolerant' repertoires or produced by in vitro affinity maturation, can serve to equip patient T cells with new anti-tumor specificities that are not naturally present in the autologous repertoire. TCR transfer into CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells can serve to harness the function of both helper and cytotoxic T cells for tumor elimination and establishment of long-term tumor immunity.","['Morris, Emma', 'Hart, Dan', 'Gao, Liquan', 'Tsallios, Aristotle', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Stauss, Hans']","['Morris E', 'Hart D', 'Gao L', 'Tsallios A', 'Xue SA', 'Stauss H']","['Department of Immunology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer/methods', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation']",2005/06/28 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)00030-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2005.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2006 Mar;20(2):61-9. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2005.05.001.

We previously raised a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), Ta60b mAb (IgG1kappa), specifically recognizing CD25, and an attempt was made here to produce a single chain Fv fragment (scFv) from this mAb as an initial step to development of scFv-based therapeutics. cDNA fragments encoding for the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of the Ta60b mAb were thus isolated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated cloning, and, an expression vector constructed to express Ta60b scFv fused with the maltose binding protein (MBP) in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. The soluble form of MBP-Ta60b fused scFv could be extracted and affinity-purified with an amylose/agarose column, allowing its immunoreactivity to be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), mixed hemadsorption assay, and fluorescence activated cell sorting. In addition, binding activity was studied by competitive ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The results showed that Ta60b scFv obtained from periplasm retains good reactivity, although its KD value was 4-fold lower than that of the whole Ta60b antibody, suggesting possible clinical use for treatment of patients with CD25-expressing tumors and also for enhancing anti-tumor immunity.","['Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Yoshikawa, Kazuhiro', 'Hayashi, Takeshi', 'Takasu, Syuntaro', 'Kawada, Yoichi', 'Uchida, Kazuo', 'Sato, Shigeki', 'Takahashi, Toshitada', 'Saga, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Muramatsu H', 'Yoshikawa K', 'Hayashi T', 'Takasu S', 'Kawada Y', 'Uchida K', 'Sato S', 'Takahashi T', 'Saga S', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Pathology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Aichi 480-1195, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00992-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.12.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2005 Jul 28;225(2):225-36. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.12.018.

However, the molecular pathways that trigger cell growth remain unclear in neuronal precursors. In the present studies, we used a retinal explant culture system to investigate the response of signal transducer and activator of transcription factors (STATs) to extrinsic factors during mouse retinal development. Retinas from embryonic and neonatal stages showed that STAT3 but not STAT1 was activated in response to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in distinct patterns. STAT3 activation was detected in the outermost retina layer in response to CNTF, LIF, FGF1, and IFN-alpha 24 hr after stimulation in postnatal day 1 (PN1) explants, but not FGF2, EGF, IFN-gamma, and retinoic acid (RA). Cytokine stimulation increased the number of cells incorporating BrdU and the labelled cells co-localized with phosphorylated STAT3, indicating that STAT3 may play an essential role in coupling extrinsic factors to retina precursor cell (RPC) proliferation. Furthermore, persistent expression of two neural precursor markers, Hes1 and Otx2 was detected in outer retinal layers and correlated with STAT3 activation by CNTF, suggesting that STAT3 activation may play a critical role in stimulating mitotic precursors. These results strongly support a model that STAT3-mediated signalling regulates precursor populations during mouse retina development.","['Zhang, Samuel Shao-Min', 'Liu, Mu-Gen', 'Kano, Arihiro', 'Zhang, Chun', 'Fu, Xin-Yuan', 'Barnstable, Colin J']","['Zhang SS', 'Liu MG', 'Kano A', 'Zhang C', 'Fu XY', 'Barnstable CJ']","['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Exp Eye Res,Experimental eye research,0370707,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Otx Transcription Factors)', '0 (Otx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Otx Transcription Factors', 'Retina/drug effects/*embryology/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2004/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4835(05)00028-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exer.2005.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Eye Res. 2005 Jul;81(1):103-15. doi: 10.1016/j.exer.2005.01.016.,,"['EY13607/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY13865/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the pathologic findings in a 13-year-old boy who died after a 6-year clinical history of progressive ataxia, extrapyramidal manifestations, and lower motor neuron abnormalities. Histological evaluation of the brain revealed widespread NII in most neurons. Marked loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurons in the dentate nucleus, red nucleus, and spinal cord anterior horns was accompanied by a modest astrocytosis. Because of the abundance of NII and the absence of a relationship between NII and neuronal loss or microglial activation, we conclude that loss of cerebellar, brainstem, and spinal cord neurons reflects selective neuronal vulnerability. NII were immunoreactive for ubiquitin, glucocorticoid receptor, and SUMO-1, a small, ubiquitin-like protein purportedly involved in protein transport and gene transcription. NII were non-reactive for polyglutamine (1C2), TATA binding protein, promyelocytic leukemia protein, heat shock protein 90, tau, alpha-synuclein, neurofilament, and beta amyloid. The moderate ubiquitin and strong SUMO-1 staining of NII in juvenile cases is the reverse of the pattern noted in adult diseases, suggesting the two age groups are pathogenically distinct. We suggest that juvenile NIID is a spinocerebellar brainstem ataxic disease possibly related to an abnormality in SUMOylation.","['McFadden, Kathryn', 'Hamilton, Ronald L', 'Insalaco, Sam J', 'Lavine, Lawrence', 'Al-Mateen, Majeed', 'Wang, Guoji', 'Wiley, Clayton A']","['McFadden K', 'Hamilton RL', 'Insalaco SJ', 'Lavine L', 'Al-Mateen M', 'Wang G', 'Wiley CA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. mcfaddenka@msx.upmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Crystallins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (SNCA protein, human)', '0 (Synucleins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (alpha-Synuclein)', '0 (tau Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Brain/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Crystallins/metabolism', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', '*Neurodegenerative Diseases/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurofilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptides/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Synucleins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'alpha-Synuclein', 'tau Proteins/metabolism']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnen/64.6.545 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2005 Jun;64(6):545-52. doi: 10.1093/jnen/64.6.545.,,"['K24 MH001717/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH064921/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 MH01717/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1402362,,['NIHMS8896'],,,,,,

Any resultant ALV-J viral isolates to be characterised by neutralisation cross testing in order to determine antigenic relationships to overseas isolates of ALV-J. STUDY DESIGN: Samples of blood, feather pulp, albumen and tumours were obtained from broiler breeder flocks which represented four genetic strains of meat chickens being grown in Victoria, South Australia, NSW and Queensland. Dead and ailing birds were necropsied on farm and samples were collected for microscopic and virological examinations. Virus isolation was carried out in C/O and DF-1 CEF cultures and ALV group specific antigen was detected in culture lysates using AC-ELISA. Micro-neutralisation assay was used for antigenic characterisation of selected isolates. Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured cells, tumours and feather pulp. ALV-J envelope sequences were amplified by PCR using specific ALV-J primers while antibodies against ALV-J were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 62 ALV-J isolates were recovered and confirmed by PCR from 15 (31.3%) of 48 breeder flocks tested. Antibody to ALV-J was detected in 20 (47.6%) of the 42 flocks tested. Characteristic lesions of myeloid leukosis caused by ALV-J were found in affected flocks. The gross pathological lesions were characterised by skeletal myelocytomas located on the inner sternum and ribs, neoplastic enlargement of the liver, and in some cases gross tumour involvement of the spleen, kidney, trachea, skeletal muscles, bone marrow, skin and gonads. Microscopically, the tumours consisted of immature granulated myelocytes, and were present as focal or diffuse infiltrations in the affected organs. Virus micro-neutralisation assays demonstrated antigenic variation among Australian isolates and to overseas strains of ALV-J. CONCLUSION: ALV-J infection was prevalent in Australian broiler breeder flocks during 2001 to 2003. Australian isolates of ALV-J show a degree of antigenic variation when compared to overseas isolates.","['Bagust, T J', 'Fenton, S P', 'Reddy, M R']","['Bagust TJ', 'Fenton SP', 'Reddy MR']","['School of Veterinary Science, the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Avian Leukosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', '*Chickens', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Muscle, Skeletal/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Trachea/virology']",2005/06/28 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/06/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-0813.2004.tb12163.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2004 Nov;82(11):701-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.2004.tb12163.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Planning such studies requires establishing a sample size that will ensure adequate statistical power. For microarray analyses, false discovery rate (FDR) is considered to be an appropriate error measure. Several FDR-controlling procedures have been developed. How these procedures perform for such analyses has not been evaluated thoroughly under realistic assumptions. In order to develop a method of determining sample sizes for these procedures, it needs to be established whether these procedures really control the FDR below the pre-specified level so that the determined sample size indeed provides adequate power. To answer this question, we first conducted simulation studies. Our simulation results showed that these procedures do control the FDR at most situations but under-control the FDR when the proportion of positive genes is small, the most likely scenarios. Thus, these existing procedures can overestimate the power and underestimate the sample size. Accordingly, we developed a simulation-based method to provide more accurate estimates for power and sample size.","['Li, Shuying S', 'Bigler, Jeannette', 'Lampe, Johanna W', 'Potter, John D', 'Feng, Ziding']","['Li SS', 'Bigler J', 'Lampe JW', 'Potter JD', 'Feng Z']","['Cancer Prevention Research Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. sli@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Sample Size']",2005/06/25 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.2119 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2005 Aug 15;24(15):2267-80. doi: 10.1002/sim.2119.,,"['P01 CA53996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA72035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U0186368/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,

In contrast, mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt3 (Flt3-TKD mutations) are less frequent (approximately 7%), and there are only limited data on the frequency of recently demonstrated activating Flt3 point mutation at codon 592 (Flt3-V592A mutation). We evaluated a new approach for rapid screening of Flt3-TKD and Flt3-V592A mutations using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle in a group of 122 patients. Based on individual Flt3-TKD mutations, we designed patient-specific primers to perform a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). We also used a model system with MonoMac-6 cells carrying the Flt3-V592A mutation to establish a mutation-specific real-time PCR approach also for this molecular aberration. We identified 9 cases (8%) of Flt3-TKD mutations (5 cases of mutation D835Y, 3 cases of mutation D835H, and 1 case of mutation Del836), and no cases of Flt3-V592A mutation. Screening for Flt3-TKD mutations with fluorescent probes is equivalent to conventional screening using standard PCR followed by EcoRV restriction. We present a real-time PCR protocol that can be used for MRD analyses based on individual Flt3-TKD mutations. Examples of MRD analyses are presented for all 3 subtypes of Flt3-TKD mutation identified in this study.

AIM: To measure dCK expression in tumour cells from different origins. METHOD: A rabbit antihuman dCK antibody was used for the immunocytochemical detection of dCK expression in three leukaemic cell lines (HL60, U937, and CCRF-CEM) and 97 patient samples (paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), retinoblastoma, paediatric brain tumours, and adult non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)). RESULTS: CCRF-CEM, U937, and HL60 cells stained positively for dCK and the degree of expression correlated with dCK activity. dCK expression varied between tumour types and between individual patients within one tumour type. dCK was located predominantly in the cytoplasm. The staining intensity was scored as negative (0), low (1+), intermediate (2+), or high (3+). Expression of dCK was high in AML blasts. In contrast, brain tumour samples expressed low amounts of dCK. dCK staining ranged from low (1+) to high (3+) in ALL blasts, retinoblastoma, and NSCLC tissue samples. Staining was consistent (interobserver variability, 88%; kappa = 0.83) and specific. Western blotting detected the dCK protein appropriately at 30 kDa, without additional bands. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocytochemistry is an effective and reliable method for determining the expression of dCK in patient samples and requires little tumour material. This method enables large scale screening of dCK expression in tumour samples.","['Hubeek, I', 'Peters, G J', 'Broekhuizen, A J F', 'Talianidis, I', 'Sigmond, J', 'Gibson, B E S', 'Creutzig, U', 'Giaccone, G', 'Kaspers, G J L']","['Hubeek I', 'Peters GJ', 'Broekhuizen AJ', 'Talianidis I', 'Sigmond J', 'Gibson BE', 'Creutzig U', 'Giaccone G', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Centre, De Boelelaan 1117, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Brain Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/enzymology', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Retinal Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Retinoblastoma/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/25 09:00,2005/09/07 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['58/7/695 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2004.023861 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2005 Jul;58(7):695-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2004.023861.,,,,,,PMC1770710,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the functional effect of a novel Rho-kinase inhibitor, H-1152 [(S)-(+)-2-methyl-1-[(4-methyl-5-isoquinolinyl)sulfonyl]homopiperazine], both in vitro and in vivo as well as to demonstrate the expression of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) in the rat corpus cavernosum (CC), by using a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay to measure their mRNA expression. Cumulative addition of H-1152 (0.001-3 microM) or Y-27632 [0.01-30 microM; (R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide] caused sustained relaxations of precontracted CC strips, which were not affected by inhibition of the nitric oxide signaling pathway. Addition of H-1152 (0.1 microM), Y-27632 (1 microM), or sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.1 microM) caused rightward shifts in the curves to phenylephrine (PE), but it had little effect on the contractions mediated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). It is noteworthy that when H-1152 or Y-27632 was combined with SNP, a marked synergistic inhibition was noted both on PE- and EFS-induced contractions. Intraperitoneal administration of H-1152 (100 nmol/kg) had a discrete effect on mean arterial pressure and significantly enhanced erectile responses evoked by stimulation of the cavernous nerve. The mRNA expression for PDZ-RhoGEF, p115RhoGEF, and leukemia-associated RhoGEF in cavernosal segments was visualized by electrophoresis on agarose gel. The results indicate that H-1152 is a powerful Rho-kinase inhibitor, giving rise to its therapeutic potential in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The regulator of G-protein signaling-containing RhoGEFs may represent key components of the molecular mechanisms associated with the abnormal function of the cavernosal smooth muscle.","['Teixeira, Cleber E', 'Ying, Zhekang', 'Webb, R Clinton']","['Teixeira CE', 'Ying Z', 'Webb RC']","['Department of Physiology, Medical College of Georgia, 1120 15th St., CA-3101, Augusta, GA 30912-3000, USA. cteixeira@mail.mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (2-methyl-1-((4-methyl-5-isoquinolinyl)sulfonyl)homopiperazine)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '138381-45-0 (Y 27632)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/pharmacology', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Penis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'rho-Associated Kinases']",2005/06/25 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.105.086041 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.105.086041 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2005 Oct;315(1):155-62. doi: 10.1124/jpet.105.086041.

DLX4 is a member of Distal-less (DLX) family of HBX genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that abnormal expression of DLX4 is present in several types of human tumors, such as breast cancer, leukemia and colon cancer. In the present study, we investigated DLX4 mRNA and protein expression in both normal placental tissues and human choriocarcinoma cell lines. Also, using RNA interference (RNAi) technique, we knocked down the expression of DLX4 and examined apoptosis in JEG-3 cells. Our studies demonstrated that DLX4 RNAi inhibited DLX4 mRNA expression and decreased DLX4 protein mass specifically and effectively, potentially enhancing apoptosis. Moreover, we examined expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8, and found that both caspases were increased after DLX4 knockdown. However, DLX4 RNAi did not influence Bax expression in JEG-3 cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that DLX4 may be involved in the survival of human choriocarcinoma cells, which may be mediated by the inhibition of apoptosis. The detailed mechanism needs further investigation.","['Sun, Y', 'Lu, X', 'Yin, L', 'Zhao, F', 'Feng, Y']","['Sun Y', 'Lu X', 'Yin L', 'Zhao F', 'Feng Y']","['Hospital of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Fudan University, 419 Fangxie Road, Shanghai 200011, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Placenta,Placenta,8006349,"['0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choriocarcinoma/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Placenta/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2005/06/25 09:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2004/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0143-4004(05)00119-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.placenta.2005.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Placenta. 2006 Apr-May;27(4-5):375-83. doi: 10.1016/j.placenta.2005.03.007.

This oscillation is also mirrored in the platelets and reticulocytes which oscillate with the same period. Cyclical neutropenia has an animal counterpart in the grey collie. Using the mathematical model of the hematopoietic system of Colijn and Mackey [A mathematical model of hematopoiesis: I. Periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia. Companion paper to the present paper.] we have determined what parameters are necessary to mimic laboratory and clinical data on untreated grey collies and humans, and also what changes in these parameters are necessary to fit data during treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Compared to the normal steady-state values, we found that the major parameter changes that mimic untreated cyclical neutropenia correspond to a decreased amplification (increased apoptosis) within the proliferating neutrophil precursor compartment, and a decrease in the maximal rate of re-entry into the proliferative phase of the stem cell compartment. For the data obtained during G-CSF treatment, good fits were obtained only when parameters were altered that would imply that G-CSF led to higher amplification (lower rate of apoptosis) in the proliferating neutrophil precursors, and a elevated rate of differentiation into the neutrophil line.","['Colijn, Caroline', 'Mackey, Michael C']","['Colijn C', 'Mackey MC']","['Department of Mathematics and Centre for Nonlinear Dynamics, McGill University, 3655 Promenade Sir William Osler, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Dog Diseases/*blood/drug therapy', 'Dogs', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutropenia/*blood/drug therapy/veterinary', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Reticulocytes/pathology']",2005/06/25 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2004/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5193(05)00155-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.03.034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2005 Nov 21;237(2):133-46. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.03.034.

Periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia.,117-32,"Periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia (PCML) is an interesting dynamical disease of the hematopoietic system in which oscillating levels of circulating leukocytes, platelets and/or reticulocytes are observed. Typically all of these three differentiated cell types have the same oscillation period, but the relation of the oscillation mean and amplitude to the normal levels is variable. Given the appearance of the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome in all of the nucleated progeny of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the most parsimonious conclusion is that chronic myelogenous leukemia, and its periodic variant, arise from derangements partially involving the dynamics of the stem cells. Here, we have synthesized several previous mathematical models of HSC dynamics, and models for the regulation of neutrophils, platelets and erythrocytes into a comprehensive model for the regulation of the hematopoietic system. Based on estimates of parameters for a typical normal human, we have systematically explored the changes in some of these parameters necessary to account for the quantitative data on leukocyte, platelet and reticulocyte cycling in 11 patients with PCML. Our results indicate that the critical model parameter changes required to simulate the PCML patient data are an increase in the amplification in the leukocyte line, an increase in the differentiation rate from the stem cell compartment into the leukocyte line, and the rate of apoptosis in the stem cell compartment. Our model system is particularly sensitive to changes in stem cell apoptosis rates, suggesting that changes in the numbers of proliferating stem cells may be important in generating PCML.","['Colijn, Caroline', 'Mackey, Michael C']","['Colijn C', 'Mackey MC']","['Department of Mathematics and Centre for Nonlinear Dynamics, McGill University, 3655 Promenade Sir William Osler, Montreal, Que., Canada H3G 1Y6. ccolijn@cnd.mcgill.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Reticulocytes/pathology']",2005/06/25 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2004/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5193(05)00154-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.03.033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2005 Nov 21;237(2):117-32. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.03.033.

The median age at the time of diagnosis is 60-65 years, and the large majority of elderly patients usually receive less intensive chemotherapy or only supportive therapy due to the high treatment-related mortality when using intensive therapy for elderly individuals. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches to improve the treatment in younger patients and to make AML-directed therapy with acceptable toxicity possible in elderly individuals. Angiogenesis seems to be important both for leukemogenesis and susceptibility to intensive chemotherapy, and antiangiogenic strategies are therefore considered for the treatment of AML. The two proangiogenic mediators vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8, (IL-8, also referred to as CXCL8) seem to be important in human AML: VEGF is released at increased levels due to interactions between AML cells and neighboring nonleukemic cells, whereas IL-8 is released at high levels by native human AML cells. Thus, VEGF as a therapeutic target in AML is suggested both by experimental and clinical observations, whereas IL-8 as a target is mainly suggested by experimental evidence. In the present review we describe and discuss (i) the angioregulatory network of soluble mediators in AML, including both the systemic levels and local release by native human AML cells; and (ii) various therapeutic approaches to target VEGF and IL-8. Although single angioregulatory mediators can be targeted, it should be emphasized that the final effect of soluble mediators on angioregulation is determined by a complex angioregulatory network that varies between AML patients, and the final effect of targeting single mediators may therefore differ between patient subsets.","['Hatfield, Kimberley J', 'Olsnes, Astrid M', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Hatfield KJ', 'Olsnes AM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*drug effects/physiology/*therapeutic use']",2005/06/25 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009054064651 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2005 Jun;5(4):229-48. doi: 10.2174/1568009054064651.,222,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This investment has already given some benefits since some of these inhibitors show potent chemotherapeutic efficacy against a wide range of tumours such as non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of pancreas, bladder cancer, leukaemia and some solid tumours. In fact a few of them have already been approved for the clinical treatment of some kinds of cancer. All aspects of RNR inhibition and corresponding inhibitors are the subjects of this review.

The fusion protein may not therefore have an oncogenic capability beyond these progenitors. To assess whether EWS-ERG can be a tumour initiator in cells other than mesenchymal cells, we have analysed Ews-ERG fusion protein function in a cellular environment not typical of that found in human cancers, namely, committed lymphoid cells. We have used Ews-ERG invertor mice having an inverted ERG cDNA cassette flanked by loxP sites knocked in the Ews intron 8, crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Rag1 gene to give conditional, lymphoid-specific expression of the fusion protein. Clonal T cell neoplasias arose in these mice. This conditional Ews gene fusion model of tumourigenesis shows that Ews-ERG can cause haematopoietic tumours and the precursor cells are committed cells. Thus, Ews-ERG can function in cells that do not have to be pluripotent progenitors or mesenchymal cells.","['Codrington, Rosalind', 'Pannell, Richard', 'Forster, Alan', 'Drynan, Lesley F', 'Daser, Angelika', 'Lobato, Nati', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Rabbitts, Terence H']","['Codrington R', 'Pannell R', 'Forster A', 'Drynan LF', 'Daser A', 'Lobato N', 'Metzler M', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (EWS-ERG fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Thymoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism']",2005/06/25 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/06/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['04-PLBI-RA-0909R2 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pbio.0030242 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2005 Aug;3(8):e242. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030242.

METHODS: Gamma delta T-cell malignancies were detected based on flow cytometric demonstration of an abnormal T-cell population staining positive with T-cell receptor gamma delta and confirmed by morphologic and clinical reviews. Clinical data were obtained through chart review and discussion with the patients' physicians. RESULTS: Blood or bone marrow involvement was present in all patients. Hepatosplenic and cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphomas had an aggressive clinical course, whereas the gamma delta T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemias had an indolent course. Expressions of CD5, CD8, CD16, and CD57 differed in gamma delta T-cell LGL leukemia compared with hepatosplenic and cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma delta T-cell malignancies have a poor prognosis with the exception of gamma delta T-cell LGL leukemia (indolent process). Because CD57 expression is specific for gamma delta T-cell LGL leukemias, expression of this antigen may be associated with a more indolent clinical course.

METHODS: Fifty-four patients with AML/MDS were seen for pretreatment evaluation of their cognitive function and symptoms. Fifty percent of the sample was reevaluated 1 month later, when response to protocol chemotherapy was assessed. RESULTS: A significant proportion of patients had impaired cognitive function prior to the institution of chemotherapy. Sixty-five percent of patients also experienced significant fatigue. Levels of the circulating cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were elevated highly compared with normal controls. Higher IL-6 levels were associated with poorer executive function, whereas higher IL-8 levels were associated with better memory performance. IL-6, IL-1RA, and TNF-alpha levels were related to ratings of fatigue. Fatigue and cognitive dysfunction were unrelated. Hemoglobin levels were not associated significantly with either cognitive dysfunction or fatigue. Patients who obtained a complete response tended to have better fine motor control at baseline and lower circulating IL-1 levels. Treatment did not have a significant impact on cognition, although fatigue levels tended to increase. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AML/MDS are highly symptomatic and experience cognitive impairment and fatigue before the initiation of their treatment. The current results indicated a correlation between these symptoms and levels of circulating cytokines, providing some support to the hypothesis that cancer-related symptoms are related at least in part to cytokine-immunologic activation. Elucidation of immunologic correlates of symptoms will allow for targeted interventions.","['Meyers, Christina A', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Meyers CA', 'Albitar M', 'Estey E']","['Department of Neurooncology, The University of Texas M.

The outcome of patients undergoing second salvage therapy in relation to complete response (CR) rates and survival has not been documented. The authors analyzed the outcome of patients with AML undergoing second salvage therapy, and identified prognostic factors associated with response and survival. METHODS: The records of 594 patients with AML undergoing second salvage therapy from 1980 until 2004 were reviewed. The patient median age was 50 years. Salvage therapy included allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 74 patients, standard-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) combinations in 30 patients, high-dose ara-C combinations in 171 patients, non-ara-C combinations in 73 patients, and Phase I-II single agents in 246 patients. RESULTS: Overall, 76 patients (13%) achieved CR. The median CR duration was 7 months. The median survival was 1.5 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 8%. A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for CR identified the following 6 independent adverse factors: first CR duration < 6 months; second CR duration < 6 months; salvage therapy not including allogeneic SCT; non-inversion 16 AML; platelet counts < 50 x 10(9)/L, and leukocytosis > 50 x 10(9)/L. Patients were divided into low-risk (1-2 adverse factors; 8%), intermediate 1 (3 factors; 20%), intermediate 2 (4 factors; 38%), and high-risk groups (5-6 factors; 33%) with respective CR rates of 54%, 26%, 8%, and 0%. The respective 1-year survival rates were 36%, 21%, 6%, and 1%. A multivariate analysis for survival identified the following 7 independent adverse factors: first CR duration < 12 months; second CR duration < 6 months; bilirubin level > or = 1 mg/dL; albumin level < 3 g/dL; age > 60 years; bone marrow blasts > or = 50%; and year of therapy before 1991.

NK cell cytotoxicity is triggered by failure to recognize the appropriate HLA class I ligand on target cells. Recently, it has been shown that HLA class I ligand incompatibility in the graft-versus-host (GvH) direction is associated with a better outcome in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Since KIR genotypes are very diverse in the population, we explored whether or not the donor KIR genotype could affect the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect in the related HLA-identical HSCT setting. We determined the KIR and HLA genotypes of 65 HLA-identical patient-donor siblings. We found that the presence of two activating KIRs, 2DS1 and 2DS2, in the donor was significantly associated with a decreased leukemic relapse rate (P=0.03; OR=0.18; 95% CI: 0.037-0.88). Moreover, the probability of relapse at 5 years was significantly lower for patients who received a graft from a donor with the 2DS1(+)2DS2(+) genotype than for those who received a transplant from other donors (17 vs 63%, respectively; P=0.018). In conclusion, this study suggests that a joint effect of these two selected activating KIRs in the donor might confer some protection against leukemic relapse.","['Verheyden, S', 'Schots, R', 'Duquet, W', 'Demanet, C']","['Verheyden S', 'Schots R', 'Duquet W', 'Demanet C']","['HLA Laboratory, Academisch ziekenhuis-Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (KIR2DS2 protein, human)', '0 (KRT2 protein, human)', '0 (Keratin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Keratin-2', 'Keratins', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403839 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403839 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1446-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403839.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1446-1451.']",,,,,

We analyzed six such lymphomas for transforming events. The HLs were combined in two cases with follicular lymphoma (FL), and in one case each with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In the HL/FL and HL/MCL combinations, BCL2/IGH and CCND1/IGH translocations, respectively, were detected in both the HL and NHL. No mutations were found in the tumor suppressor genes FAS, NFKBIA and ATM. The HL/DLBCL case harbored clonal replacement mutations of the TP53 gene on both alleles exclusively in the DLBCL. In conclusion, we present the first examples of molecularly verified IgH-associated translocations in HL, which also show that BCL2/IGH or CCND1/IGH translocations can represent early steps in the pathogenesis of composite HL/FL or HL/MCL. The restriction of the TP53 mutations to the DLBCL in the HL/DLBCL case exemplifies a late transforming event that presumably happened in the germinal center and affected the fate of a common lymphoma precursor cell towards development of a DLBCL.","['Schmitz, R', 'Renne, C', 'Rosenquist, R', 'Tinguely, M', 'Distler, V', 'Menestrina, F', 'Lestani, M', 'Stankovic, T', 'Austen, B', 'Brauninger, A', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Kuppers, R']","['Schmitz R', 'Renne C', 'Rosenquist R', 'Tinguely M', 'Distler V', 'Menestrina F', 'Lestani M', 'Stankovic T', 'Austen B', 'Brauninger A', 'Hansmann ML', 'Kuppers R']","['Institute for Cell Biology (Tumor Research), University of Duisburg-Essen Medical School, Essen, Germany. roland.schmitz@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', '*Mutation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403841 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403841 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1452-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403841.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1452-1458.']",,,,,

In the majority of cases, different proportions of tumor cells expressed bcl-2, CD10 and Ki67 in LNs and BMs. Tumor cells in the BM showed ongoing somatic hypermutation of the IgV(H) genes; the distribution of these mutations was highly consistent with antigen selection. The topology of the genealogical trees revealed that different subclones populate the LN and BM and BM infiltration may occur at different points of the clonal evolution of FL. Early descendants of the original tumor clone and derivatives of diversified tumor clones may invade the BM.

We sought to determine whether the sample source and methodology used to measure protein expression affect the results obtained. To determine the importance of sample source, we used Western blotting to compare the expression of eight proteins and phosphoproteins in the leukemia blast-enriched fraction of 118 blood- and 108 marrow-derived samples, including 37 paired samples. To determine the importance of methodology, the expression of five proteins was measured in 20 paired samples by Western blotting, laser scanning cytometry (LSC), and flow cytometry. The mean expression and range of expression in blood- and marrow-derived samples were statistically identical for all eight proteins. Expression measurements for the 37 paired blood and marrow samples also had very high statistical correlation. The LSC and flow cytometry data had the highest concordance when compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnoff D-stats (range of R values, 0.8-1.0). High concordance was also observed between the LSC and flow cytometry results when the percentage of cells positive for expression was dichotomized into positive or negative expression. However, there was less correlation between LSC and flow cytometry when the actual percentages of positive cells were compared. The majority of discordant situations involved samples that were positive by flow cytometry but negative by LSC. The correlation between Western blotting signal intensity and the percentage of expression-positive cells measured by LSC or flow cytometry varied by protein but was limited when there was little heterogeneity in expression by either method. In conclusion, provided that leukemia blast-enriched fractions were analyzed, the blood- and marrow-derived samples had identical protein expression. There was good concordance of results between flow cytometry and LSC, which share similar technology, but more limited correlation between these methods and Western blotting.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Womble, M', 'Cade, J S', 'Lemker, E', 'Qiu, Y H']","['Kornblau SM', 'Womble M', 'Cade JS', 'Lemker E', 'Qiu YH']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4095, USA. skornbla@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Laser Scanning Cytometry/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*analysis/*metabolism']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/10/21 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403845 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403845 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Sep;19(9):1550-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403845.,,"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In analogy with Flt3 alterations, NPM1 mutations are mostly detectable in AML with normal karyotype and their recognition may be relevant to identify distinct response to treatment. Hence, in addition to conventional karyotyping and RT-PCR of fusion genes, combined analysis of both Flt3 and NPM1 mutations will be increasingly relevant in the genetic diagnosis work-up of AML. We developed a multiplex RT-PCR assay followed by capillary electrophoresis to simultaneously analyze NPM1 and Flt3 gene alterations (NFmPCR assay). The assay was validated in leukemic cell RNAs extracted from 38 AML patients, which had been previously characterized for Flt3 status by conventional RT-PCR. Direct sequencing of NPM1 RT-PCR products was carried out in 15 cases to verify results obtained by capillary electrophoresis.

Graft-versus-host disease and its treatment with steroids are the main risk factors; underlying diagnosis, age and gender are further risk factors. It has been speculated that low baseline bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with AVN posttransplant. Furthermore, rapid bone loss with consecutive microarchitectural changes might prone patients to AVN. METHODS: In a single-center prospective cohort study, 255 patients undergoing allogeneic SCT for CML, AML, MDS, and ALL were followed for at least 5 years. We measured BMD (spine, femoral neck, total body) and body indices (body weight, body mass index, body composition determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) at baseline. Annual changes of BMD and body indices were prospectively observed for 5 years. Incidence of hip AVN necessitating total arthroplasty (severe adverse event) was determined. Univariate and multifactorial nominal logistic as well as Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed. RESULTS: Severe adverse events occurred in nine patients (5-year cumulative incidence rate 6.9%). Baseline BMD and body indices were within normal limits. Rapid and intense bone loss occurred, especially during the first year, accompanied by loss of body and especially muscle mass. AVN occurrence was not associated with BMD or body indices at baseline neither with prospectively observed changes of BMD or body indices. CONCLUSIONS: AVN is a devastating frequent complication of allogeneous SCT. Allogeneous SCT is followed by dramatic changes in BMD and body composition. However, low BMD and rapid bone loss per se do not dispose patients to AVN occurrence.","['Schulte, Claudia M S', 'Beelen, Dietrich W']","['Schulte CM', 'Beelen DW']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122 Essen, Germany. claudia.schulte@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Body Mass Index', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200506270-00018 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000164353.86447.db [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2005 Jun 27;79(12):1748-55. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000164353.86447.db.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center study. MR was evaluated using the real-time RT-PCR method for the detection of bcr-abl transcripts. RESULTS: In the first group, 133 of 158 (84%) pts were in the first chronic phase of CML, and the corresponding figures were 33 of 49 (67%) pts in group 2 and 19 of 29 (64%) in group 3 (P<0.05).

This investigation examines the degree of vector ellipticity of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) in the home, with regard to the adverse health effects reportedly associated with ELF-MFs, for instance childhood leukaemia. Tri-axial measurements of the magnitude and phase of the 0-3000 Hz magnetic fields, produced by 226 domestic mains-fed appliances of 32 different types, were carried out in 16 homes in Worcestershire in the summer of 2004. Magnetic field strengths were low, with average (RMS) values of 0.03 +/- 0.02 microT across all residences. In contrast, background field ellipticities were high, on average 47 +/- 11%. Microwave and electric ovens produced the highest ellipticities: mean respective values of 21 +/- 21% and 21 +/- 17% were observed 20 cm away from these appliances. There was a negative correlation between field strength and field polarization, which we attribute to the higher relative field contribution close to each individual (single-phase) appliance. The measurements demonstrate that domestic magnetic fields are extremely complex and cannot simply be characterized by traditional measurements such as time-weighted average or peak exposure levels. We conclude that ellipticity should become a relevant metric for future epidemiological studies of health and ELF-MF exposure.","['Ainsbury, Elizabeth A', 'Conein, Emma', 'Henshaw, Denis L']","['Ainsbury EA', 'Conein E', 'Henshaw DL']","['H H Wills Physics Laboratory, University of Bristol, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol BS8 1TL, UK.

Inactivation of the Apaf-1 gene is implicated in disease progression and chemoresistance of some malignancies. In this study, we attempted to clarify the role of Apaf-1 in leukemogenesis. Apaf-1 mRNA levels were below the detection limit or very low in 5 of 20 human leukemia cell lines (25%) and 5 of 12 primary acute myeloblastic leukemia cells (42%). There were no gross structural abnormalities in the Apaf-1 gene in these samples. Expression of factors regulating Apaf-1 transcription, such as E2F-1, p53, and Sp-1, did not differ between Apaf-1-positive and Apaf-1-negative cells. Methylation of CpG in the region between +87 and +128 of the Apaf-1 gene was almost exclusively observed in Apaf-1-defective cell lines. Treatment of these cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation, restored the expression of Apaf-1. Furthermore, we showed that the region between +87 and +128 could act as a repressor element by recruiting corepressors such as methylated DNA-binding domain 2 and histone deacetylase 1 upon methylation. Overexpression of Dnmt1, a mammalian maintenance DNA methyltransferase, was associated with Apaf-1 gene methylation. DNAs from Dnmt1-overexpressing cells were more resistant to digestion with methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII than those from cells with low Dnmt1 expression, suggesting that Dnmt1 mediates aberrant methylation of multiple genes. In conclusion, methylation silencing is a mechanism of the inactivation of Apaf-1 in acute leukemia, and Dnmt1 overexpression may underlie hypermethylation of the Apaf-1 gene.","['Furukawa, Yutaka', 'Sutheesophon, Krittaya', 'Wada, Taeko', 'Nishimura, Miki', 'Saito, Yasushi', 'Ishii, Hideshi', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Furukawa Y', 'Sutheesophon K', 'Wada T', 'Nishimura M', 'Saito Y', 'Ishii H', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Minamikawachi-machi, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['3/6/325 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-04-0105 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2005 Jun;3(6):325-34. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-04-0105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, human cells and tissues appear capable of metabolically incorporating Neu5Gc from exogenous sources, including dietary red meat and dairy products. All normal humans studied are now shown to have circulating Abs against Neu5Gc, with marked differences in isotype levels. The question arises whether such Abs can adversely affect Neu5Gc-expressing human cells or tissues. In this study, we show that although normal human PBMC do not incorporate Neu5Gc during in vitro incubation, activated T cells do. Primary human leukemia cells and human leukemic cell lines are even more efficient at incorporation. Human sera containing naturally high levels of anti-Neu5Gc IgG Abs (hereafter abbreviated GcIg) deposited complement on Neu5Gc-expressing leukemic cells and activated T cells, but not on normal cells. The binding of GcIg resulted in complement-mediated cytotoxicity, which was inhibited by heat inactivation. Low anti-Neu5Gc IgG-containing human sera did not mediate any of these effects. Mixed killing assays confirmed the 15-fold selective killing of leukemic cells over PBMC by GcIg following Neu5Gc feeding. This approach could potentially serve as novel way to target malignant cells for death in vivo using either natural Abs or anti-Neu5Gc Abs prepared for this purpose. Further studies are needed to determine whether deposition of natural GcIg and complement can also target healthy proliferating immune cells for death in vivo following incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc.","['Nguyen, Dzung H', 'Tangvoranuntakul, Pam', 'Varki, Ajit']","['Nguyen DH', 'Tangvoranuntakul P', 'Varki A']","['Glycobiology Research and Training Center, and Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Neuraminic Acids)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neuraminic Acids/immunology/metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/chemistry/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['175/1/228 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.175.1.228 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Jul 1;175(1):228-36. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.1.228.,,"['R01CA38701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM32373/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first step, we analyzed agreement of morphologic diagnosis between Japanese and German hematologists. Blood and bone marrow slides of 129 patients diagnosed with FAB-RA, FAB-RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), or aplastic anemia were selected randomly and evaluated separately by each group. The agreements of diagnoses according to FAB and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications were 98.4% and 83.8%, respectively. Second, we compared clinical features between 131 Japanese and 597 German patients with FAB-RA. Japanese patients were significantly younger than German patients. Japanese patients had more severe cytopenias. However, prognosis of Japanese patients was significantly more favorable than that of German patients. Japanese patients had a significantly lower cumulative risk of acute leukemia evolution than did German patients. Frequency of WHO-RA in Japanese patients with FAB-RA was significantly higher than that in German patients.

The development of Myc-induced lymphoid tumors has been well studied and supports this model. Myc can be upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its exact role in myeloid leukemogenesis is unclear. To study its role in AML, we used a murine stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviral gene transfer/transplantation system to broadly express Myc in the bone marrow of mice either alone or in combination with antiapoptotic mutations. Myc expression in the context either of Arf/Ink4a loss or Bcl-2 coexpression induced a mixture of acute myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias (AML+ALL). In the absence of antiapoptotic mutations however, all mice transplanted with MSCV-Myc (100%, n = 110) developed AML exclusively. MSCV-Myc-induced AML was polyclonal, readily transplantable, possessed an intact Arf-p53 pathway, and did not display cytogenetic abnormalities by spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis. Lastly, we found that Myc preferentially stimulated the growth of myeloid progenitor cells in methylcellulose. These data provide the first direct evidence that Myc is a critical downstream effector of myeloid leukemogenesis and suggest that myeloid progenitors are intrinsically resistant to Myc-induced apoptosis.","['Luo, Hui', 'Li, Qing', ""O'Neal, Julie"", 'Kreisel, Friederike', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Tomasson, Michael H']","['Luo H', 'Li Q', ""O'Neal J"", 'Kreisel F', 'Le Beau MM', 'Tomasson MH']","['Department of Medicine and Genetics, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylcellulose/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67240-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0734 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2452-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0734.

We found that ZAP-70+ CLL cells expressed activated heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with high binding affinity for Hsp90 inhibitors, such as 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG), whereas normal lymphocytes or ZAP-70- CLL cells expressed nonactivated Hsp90. Activated Hsp90 bound and stabilized ZAP-70, which behaved like an Hsp90 client protein only in CLL cells. Treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) induced ZAP-70 degradation and apoptosis in CLL cells but not in T cells, and also impaired B-cell receptor signaling in leukemia cells. Transduction of ZAP-70- CLL cells with an adenovirus encoding ZAP-70 activated Hsp90 and specifically rendered the leukemia cells sensitive to 17-AAG. These data indicate that Hsp90 is necessary for ZAP-70 expression and activity; that ZAP-70 is unique among Hsp90 clients, in that its chaperone-dependency is conditional on the cell type in which it is expressed; and also that ZAP-70 is required for cell survival and signaling in CLL. Additionally, ZAP-70 expression in CLL cells confers markedly heightened sensitivity to 17-AAG or 17-DMAG, suggesting that these or other Hsp90 inhibitors could be valuable therapeutically in patients with aggressive CLL.","['Castro, Januario E', 'Prada, Carlos E', 'Loria, Olivier', 'Kamal, Adeela', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Burrows, Francis J', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Castro JE', 'Prada CE', 'Loria O', 'Kamal A', 'Chen L', 'Burrows FJ', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores University of California San Diego (UCSD) Cancer Center, University of California, CA 92093-0960, USA. je-castro@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lac Operon', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67246-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-1099 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2506-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1099.

Originally developed as a general cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, flavopiridol is a potent transcriptional suppressor through the inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb; CDK9/cyclin T). P-TEFb phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II to promote transcriptional elongation. Because most CLL cells are not actively cycling, and their viability is dependent upon the continuous expression of antiapoptotic proteins, we hypothesized that flavopiridol induces apoptosis in CLL cells through the transcriptional down-regulation of such proteins. This study demonstrated that flavopiridol inhibited the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II in primary CLL cells and reduced RNA synthesis. This was associated with a decline of the transcripts and the levels of short-lived antiapoptotic proteins such as myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), and resulted in the induction of apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein level remained stable, although its mRNA was consistently reduced, suggesting that the outcome of transcriptional inhibition by flavopiridol is governed by the intrinsic stability of the individual transcripts and proteins. The dependence of CLL-cell survival on short-lived oncoproteins may provide the biochemical basis for the therapeutic index in response to flavopiridol.","['Chen, Rong', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William']","['Chen R', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67247-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-04-1678 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2513-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1678.

Another 16 normal donors' marrow samples were taken as controls. Immunocytochemical method (APAAP) and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) fluorescence were used simultaneously on cytospins of nucleated cells from these patients. Then, the ratios of IGF-IR positive cells and apoptosis cells in all nucleated cells were counted separately. The results showed that (1) there was a higher IGF-IR expression rate (56.8 +/- 14.3)% in nucleated cells of MDS marrow than that in normal marrow (40.4 +/- 9.6)% (P < 0.01). Also IGF-IR positive rate in AML marrow (86.8 +/- 13.8)% was significantly higher than that in normal marrow (P < 0.01).

The expression of PAC-1 in group I was higher than that in control group (P < 0.01), the expression of PAC-1 in group II was lower than that in control group (P > 0.01), There was no significant difference in expression of CD62p and PAC-1 between group III and control group (P > 0.01), and no significant difference was found between AL group with megakaryocyte malignant pathological changes and AL group without megakaryocyte malignant pathological changes before platelet activated by ADP (P > 0.01). After platelet activated by ADP, the expression of PAC-1 in the former was lower than that in the latter (P < 0.01). It is concluded that (1) high level activated platelet in peripheral blood of AL patients show that interaction between activated platelet and leukemia cells can be one of reason resulting in widespread hemorrhage and infiltration AL patiens; (2) the decrease of number and activted function of platelet at the first stage of AL patients may be caused by malignant hyperplasia of leukemia cells and damage of megakaryopoiesis in bone marrow.","['Luo, Wen-Da', 'Chen, Bao-Guo', 'Men, Zhe-Feng', 'Li, Bo-Li', 'Zhu, Min', 'Guo, Qun-Yi']","['Luo WD', 'Chen BG', 'Men ZF', 'Li BL', 'Zhu M', 'Guo QY']","['Department of Hematology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Linhai 31700, China.

To explore the feasibility and safety of clinical therapy application of peripheral blood derived DC cultured ex vivo, and analyze the influence of DC-inducing-immunotherapy upon long-term survival of ANLL patients accepted autologous bone marrow transplantation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of 13 ANLL patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation were collected by using CS3000Plus. DC immunotherapy was administered after cultivation of PBMNC ex vivo for 2 weeks, desease-free survival time was observed after therapy for long time follow-up. The results showed that no any severe adverse event associated with DC therapy was observed, the survival analysis of Kaplan-Meier suggested that five year survival rate was 75.52% in DC group while 45.71% in non-DC group.

B-cell antigen expression was found in 52 out of 56 patients with Ph(+)ALL. 54.4% (43/79) patients had additional chromosome abnormalities including chromosome 7, double Ph and plus 8, etc. Complete remission (CR) rate of Ph(+)ALL and Ph(+)MAL was 57.0%, none of Ph(+)AML achieved CR. Median overall survival of Ph(+)ALL, Ph(+)MAL and Ph(+)AML were 10, 10 and 2.5 months respectively. It is concluded that Ph(+)AL has highly heterogeneity involving various differentiated stages of immature leukemic cells. Since the poor prognosis associated with this kind of AL, early diagnosis with MIC classification is a prerequisite to take more effective conditioning regimen and prospectively consideration of allogeneic stem cell transplantation to improve prognosis.","['Qiu, Jing-Ying', 'Zhu, Wei', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Chen, Shan-Shan', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Shi, Hui-Ling', 'Shi, Yan', 'He, Qi', 'Dang, Hui', 'Wang, De-Bing', 'Lu, Dao-Pei']","['Qiu JY', 'Zhu W', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen SS', 'Jiang B', 'Shi HL', 'Shi Y', 'He Q', 'Dang H', 'Wang DB', 'Lu DP']","['Institute of Hematology, People Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Remission Induction']",2005/06/24 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)03-0358-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jun;13(3):358-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between November 1999 and June 2000, 2,900 patients, between 9-17 years of age were screened for the presence of anemia in our Adolescent Outpatient Clinic. Tanner's scale of sexual maturation was used to categorize genital development. Those patients diagnosed with anemia were further examined for bone age, history of pica, parasitosis and gastrointestinal symptoms. Complete blood count showed anemia in 44 patients. Twenty one patients (15 girls and 6 boys) were diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, 19 (15 girls and 4 boys) were diagnosed with anemia associated with infections, 3 (two girls and one boy) were carriers for beta-thalasemia and one girl had acute myeloblastic leukemia. Laboratory parameters alone were not enough in the diagnosis of iron deficiency, but age, sex, growth rate and sexual maturation stage in the pubertal period must be taken into consideration. We suggest that the reason for the lower rate of iron deficiency anemia in our patients, than expected for this age group, could be due to our patient population being more aware and careful about a balanced diet compared to the feeding behaviour of the general population in Turkey. Further studies that include lower socio-economic groups are necessary to conclude the prevalance of iron deficiency anemia among adolescents.","['Derman, Orhan', 'Okstuz-Kanbur, Nuray', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Klink, Ero']","['Derman O', 'Okstuz-Kanbur N', 'Yenicesu I', 'Klink E']","['Adolescent Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey. drderman@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Adolesc Med Health,International journal of adolescent medicine and health,8506960,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Health Services', 'Age Factors', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/complications/*epidemiology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2005/06/24 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/ijamh.2005.17.2.179 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Adolesc Med Health. 2005 Apr-Jun;17(2):179-86. doi: 10.1515/ijamh.2005.17.2.179.,,,,['Int J Adolesc Med Health. 2005 Apr-Jun;17(2):96-7.

Its significance in the recent era of effective therapy with imatinib mesylate is unknown. METHODS: The current study evaluated the significance of the degree of pretreatment myelofibrosis on response and survival with imatinib therapy in patients with newly diagnosed CML. The study group comprised 198 patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive, chronic-phase CML treated with imatinib mesylate therapy. They were analyzed for the prognostic significance of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis. RESULTS: Severe reticulin (Grade 3-4) fibrosis was observed in 75 patients (38%): Grade 3 in 46 (23%) patients and Grade 4 in 29 (15%) patients. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of a complete cytogenetic response in patients with Grade 4 reticulin fibrosis (76% vs. 89%; P = 0.07), and a significantly worse survival (estimated 3-year survival rate of 87% vs. 97%; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although the prognostic significance of severe reticulin fibrosis in patients with newly diagnosed CML receiving imatinib therapy was better, 15% of patients with Grade 4 reticulin fibrosis still had a worse outcome.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Wierda, William', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Faderl S', 'Wierda W', 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Traditionally, the term 'MPD' included chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). At present, these four disorders are referred to as 'classic' MPD and are distinguished from a spectrum of other MPD-like clinicopathologic entities that are operationally classified as 'atypical' MPD. The oncogenic mutations(s) in classic MPD are unknown except for CML, which is associated with an activating mutation (Bcr/Abl) of the gene encoding for the Abl cytoplasmic protein kinase (PTK). In the last 3 months, a somatic point mutation of JAK2 (JAK2(V617F)), the gene encoding for another cytoplasmic PTK was reported in the majority of patients with PV and approximately half of those with either ET or MMM. The same mutation was also found in a small number of patients with either atypical MPD or the myelodysplastic syndrome but not in normal controls, germline tissue including T lymphocytes, and patients with secondary erythrocytosis. In vitro, JAK2(V617F) was associated with constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2 and its downstream effectors as well as induction of erythropoietin hypersensitivity in cell lines. In vivo, murine bone marrow transduced with a retrovirus containing JAK2(V617F) induced erythrocytosis in the transplanted mice. Taken together, these observations suggest that JAK2(V617F) is an acquired myeloid lineage-specific mutation that engenders a pathogenetic relevance for the PV phenotype in MPD.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Tefferi A', 'Gilliland DG']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/chemistry', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/06/23 09:00,2006/06/22 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['1872 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Aug;4(8):1053-6.

Pro-apoptosis with arsenic trioxide has recently been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach. Exisulind is another potentially pro-apoptotic agent, and therefore, we investigated its influence on proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis in two sAML/MDS cell lines, one de-novo AML cell line and healthy CD34+ bone marrow cells. Treatment of sAML/MDS cells with Exisulind clearly inhibited colony formation in the CFU-assays. Interestingly, Exisulind did not alter the percentages of sAML/MDS cells in G1-, G2-, M- or S-phase, but reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in this cell type. Exisulind had no effect on de-novo AML or normal CD34+ cells. We detected increased c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity in sAML/MDS cells treated with Exisulind. Adding a specific JNK-inhibitor to Exisulind-treated sAML/MDS cells partly abrogated apoptosis, thus proving that Exisulind-mediated apoptosis in sAML/MDS cells is dependent on JNK activation. We conclude that JNK is one mediator of apoptosis in sAML/MDS cells treated with Exisulind. Moreover, our data strongly suggests to explore the potential use of Exisulind as a novel, pro-apoptotic therapy for patients with MDS and sAML/MDS.","['Czibere, Akos', 'Prall, Wolf C', 'Zerbini, Luiz F', 'Grall, Franck', 'Craigie, Eve C', 'Ulrich, Slif D', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles A N', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Libermann, Towia A', 'Aivado, Manuel']","['Czibere A', 'Prall WC', 'Zerbini LF', 'Grall F', 'Craigie EC', 'Ulrich SD', 'Giagounidis AA', 'Haas R', 'Libermann TA', 'Aivado M']","['BIDMC Genomics Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. aczibere@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'K619IIG2R9 (sulindac sulfone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/23 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1722 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.6.1722 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Jun;4(6):812-7. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.6.1722.

Tax is also believed to be implicated in leukemogenesis because of its ability to immortalize primary cells in vitro. To gain insight into the molecular pathways mediating the activities of this important gene, we identified cellular proteins interacting with Tax. By means of a two-hybrid approach, we show that Tax specifically interacts with MSX2, a general repressor of gene expression. GST pull-down experiments and co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed binding specificity. Furthermore, the N-terminal residues 1-79 of MSX2 are required for binding, whereas the C-terminal residues 201-267 of MSX2 do not play a critical role. Whereas the oncogenic potential of Tax in primary cells was only slightly affected by overexpression of MSX2, the other function of Tax, namely LTR-dependent transcriptional activation, was inhibited by MSX2 in human HeLa and bovine B-lymphoblastoid (BL3) cell lines. This MSX2 repression function can be counteracted by overexpression of transcription factors CREB2 and RAP74. The Tax/MSX2 interplay thus results in repression of viral transcriptional activation possibly acting as a regulatory feedback loop. Importantly, this viral gene silencing is not strictly associated with a concomitant loss of Tax oncogenicity as measured by its ability to immortalize primary cells. And interestingly, MSX2 also interacts with and inhibits the transactivation function of the related Tax1 protein encoded by the Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1).","['Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Lefebvre, Laurent', 'Collete, Delphine', 'Debacq, Christophe', 'Urbain, Patrice', 'Heremans, Hubertine', 'Jauniaux, Jean-Claude', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Willems, Luc', 'Kettmann, Richard']","['Twizere JC', 'Lefebvre L', 'Collete D', 'Debacq C', 'Urbain P', 'Heremans H', 'Jauniaux JC', 'Burny A', 'Willems L', 'Kettmann R']","['Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MSX2 protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (transcription factor TFIIF)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcription Factors, TFII/physiology']",2005/06/23 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)56409-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M503674200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Aug 19;280(33):29804-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M503674200.

An increased incidence of leukemia and lymphoma has been observed in workers exposed to ethylene oxide. However, contradictory findings exist regarding its ability to induce other tumor types, such as breast cancer. We characterized the genotoxicity of ethylene oxide by means of the alkaline version of comet assay in in vitro systems, in order to investigate the hypothesized role of this substance in the development of breast cancer. For this study, we used primary and secondary cultures of lymphoblasts (well-known target cells of the genotoxicity of ethylene oxide), breast epithelial cells (hypothesized target), peripheral blood lymphocytes (cells commonly used in biomonitoring), and of keratinocytes and cervical epithelial cells. DNA damage was measured and expressed as tail DNA, tail length, and tail moment. In the concentration range 0-100 microM, ethylene oxide induced a dose-dependent increase of DNA damage in the investigated cell types without notable cytotoxicity. A statistically significant increase of DNA damage could be observed after treatment with 20 microM ethylene oxide in lymphoblasts (51% increase of tail moment over the background), breast epithelial cells (26% increase) and peripheral lymphocytes (71% increase). In keratinocytes (5% increase) and cervical epithelial cells (5% increase) significant DNA damage could not be detected at this dose, but at higher concentrations (50-100 microM), such an increase was observed. These results are indicative of an increased sensitivity of breast epithelial cells towards genotoxic insults of ethylene oxide. Our observations provide additional data to evaluate the hypothesis that exposure to ethylene oxide may play a role in breast cancer, and the findings may contribute to the development of screening tests for monitoring an early response to genotoxic insults in occupational settings.","['Adam, Balazs', 'Bardos, Helga', 'Adany, Roza']","['Adam B', 'Bardos H', 'Adany R']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, P.O.

The mechanisms by which LTB4 contributes to neutrophil survival are still unclear and the present work aims at identifying intracellular pathways underlying this effect. Inhibition of human neutrophil apoptosis by LTB4 was abrogated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor wortmannin and by the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, inhibitors of p38 MAPK, Jak2/3 and Src did not hinder the anti-apoptotic effect of LTB4. We also investigated the effects of members of the Bcl-2 family as they play a crucial role in the regulation of programmed cell death. When neutrophils were incubated with LTB4 for 1 to 6 h, the mRNA levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 were upregulated approximately 2-fold, while those of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were downregulated 3- to 4-fold, as determined by real-time PCR. Accordingly, Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Mcl-1 was upregulated in presence of LTB4, while flow cytometric analysis revealed that Bax protein was downregulated. Furthermore, the modulatory effects of LTB4 on Mcl-1 and Bax proteins were abolished in the presence of either wortmannin or PD98059. Taken together, these results demonstrate the participation of PI3-K and MEK/ERK kinases, as well as regulatory apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 and Bax, in the anti-apoptotic effects of LTB4 in human neutrophils.","['Petrin, Darlaine', 'Turcotte, Sylvie', 'Gilbert, Annie-Kim', 'Rola-Pleszczynski, Marek', 'Stankova, Jana']","['Petrin D', 'Turcotte S', 'Gilbert AK', 'Rola-Pleszczynski M', 'Stankova J']","['Immunology Division, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke, 3001, North 12th Avenue, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada J1H 5N4.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/drug effects/*physiology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukotriene B4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Wortmannin', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2005/06/23 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(05)00129-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.05.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2006 Apr;18(4):479-87. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.05.021.

Serum samples from, approximately, 30 randomly selected cows from 134 herds were tested for antibodies against BLV, MAP and NC using commercially available ELISA test kits, while 5 unvaccinated cattle over 6 months of age were tested for antibodies to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). For analyzing the time (in days) to culling of cows after the blood testing, a two-step approach was utilized, non-parametric (Kaplan-Meier survival graphs) visualization and then semi-parametric survival modelling (Cox proportional hazards model), while controlling for confounding variables and adjusting for within herd clustering. For all reasons of culling, MAP-seropositive cows had a 1.38 (1.05-1.81, 95% C.I.) times increased hazard of culling compared to MAP-seronegative cows. Seropositivity for the other pathogens was not associated with an increased risk of overall culling. Among cows that were culled because of either decreased reproductive efficiency or decreased milk production or mastitis, MAP-seropositive cows were associated with 1.55 (1.12-2.15, 95% C.I.) times increased hazard compared to MAP-seronegative cows. Among cows that were culled because of reproductive inefficiency, NC-seropositive cows had a 1.43 (1.15-1.79, 95% C.I.) times greater hazard than NC-seronegative cows. Among cows that were culled because of decreased milk production, cows in BVDV-seropositive herds had a 1.86 (1.28-2.70, 95% C.I.) times increased hazard compared to cows in BVDV-seronegative herds. BLV-seropositive cows did not have an increased risk of reason-specific culling as compared to BLV-seronegative cows. No significant interaction on culling among seropositivity for the pathogens was detected, but only a limited number of cows tested seropositive for multiple pathogens. Results from our research will help in better understanding the economic impacts of these pathogens and justification for their control.","['Tiwari, Ashwani', 'VanLeeuwen, John A', 'Dohoo, Ian R', 'Stryhn, Henrik', 'Keefe, Greg P', 'Haddad, Joao P']","['Tiwari A', 'VanLeeuwen JA', 'Dohoo IR', 'Stryhn H', 'Keefe GP', 'Haddad JP']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, 550, University Avenue, Charlottetown, PEI, Canada C1A4P3. atiwari@upei.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Canada', 'Cattle/*microbiology/*virology', 'Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis/*isolation & purification', 'Neospora/*isolation & purification', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/06/23 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2004/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1135(05)00187-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2005 Aug 30;109(3-4):147-58. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.05.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to develop non-viral transfection methods that could transform patient tumor cells into cancer vaccines, paving the way for rapid production of autologous cell-based vaccines. METHODS: As the extended culture and expansion of most patient tumor cells is not possible, we sought to first evaluate a new technology that combines electroporation and chemical transfection in order to determine if plasmid-based gene vectors could be instantaneously delivered to the nucleus, and to determine if gene expression was possible in a cell-cycle independent manner. We tested cultured cell lines, a primary murine tumor, and primary human leukemia cells from diagnostic work-up for transgene expression, using both RFP and CD137L expression vectors. RESULTS: Combined electroporation-transfection directly delivered plasmid DNA to the nucleus of transfected cells, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy and real-time PCR analysis of isolated nuclei. Expression of protein from plasmid vectors could be detected as early as two hours post transfection. However, the kinetics of gene expression from plasmid-based vectors in tumor cell lines indicated that optimal gene expression was still dependent on cell division. We then tested to see if pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) would also display the rapid gene expression kinetics of tumor cells lines, determining gene expression 24 hours after transfection. Six of 12 specimens showed greater than 17% transgene expression, and all samples showed at least some transgene expression. CONCLUSION: Given that transgene expression could be detected in a majority of primary tumor samples analyzed within hours, direct electroporation-based transfection of primary leukemia holds the potential to generate patient-specific cancer vaccines. Plasmid-based gene therapy represents a simple means to generate cell-based cancer vaccines and does not require the extensive infrastructure of a virus-based vector system.","['Gershan, Jill A', 'Johnson, Bryon D', 'Weber, James', 'Schauer, Dennis W', 'Natalia, Natalia', 'Behnke, Stephanie', 'Burns, Karen', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Warwick, Anne B', 'Orentas, Rimas J']","['Gershan JA', 'Johnson BD', 'Weber J', 'Schauer DW', 'Natalia N', 'Behnke S', 'Burns K', 'Maloney KW', 'Warwick AB', 'Orentas RJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, The Children's Research Institute, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. jgershan@mail.mcw.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Genet Vaccines Ther,Genetic vaccines and therapy,101178414,,,,2005/06/23 09:00,2005/06/23 09:01,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:01 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-0556-3-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-0556-3-4 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Vaccines Ther. 2005 Jun 21;3(1):4. doi: 10.1186/1479-0556-3-4.,,,20050621,,,PMC1182385,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a continuous activation of AP-2alpha in mastocytomas and mast cell leukemia and its transient upregulation during c-Kit dependent early steps of normal mast cell differentiation.","['Welker, P', 'Wanner, R', 'Zuberbier, T', 'Groneberg, D A', 'Henz, B M']","['Welker P', 'Wanner R', 'Zuberbier T', 'Groneberg DA', 'Henz BM']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite School of Medicine, Free University and Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Tryptases']",2005/06/23 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ALL811 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00811.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2005 Aug;60(8):1046-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00811.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They do not measure the ability of a protein to induce type I allergic reactions. Therefore, a biological assay was established that is based on the cellular mechanisms of allergies in order to assess the cross-linking capacity of allergens. METHODS: Rat basophilic leukaemia cells were transfected with cDNA coding for the human high affinity IgE receptor chains. The surface expression of the IgE-binding alpha-chain was detected by FACS analysis and the functional integration of the 'humanized' receptors into the signal transduction cascade was addressed by intracellular calcium mobilization. Mediator release was measured in response to human IgE and a variety of cross-linking allergen preparations. RESULTS: Several clones were obtained that were able to bind allergen-specific human IgE. The results of the biological assay were compared with those obtained by immunochemical methods. The biological assay was used to determine the potency of allergen extracts, including highly diluted products that cannot be analysed by conventional methods. CONCLUSION: A stable 'humanized' basophil cell line was established that will be a useful tool for the standardization and batch control of allergen extracts. Because of its high sensitivity, it can also be used to detect minute quantities of potentially allergenic proteins, e.g. in processed foods. In addition, the test may support the development of novel allergy vaccines, such as recombinant hypoallergenic molecules.","['Vogel, L', 'Luttkopf, D', 'Hatahet, L', 'Haustein, D', 'Vieths, S']","['Vogel L', 'Luttkopf D', 'Hatahet L', 'Haustein D', 'Vieths S']","['Department of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Allergens/*analysis/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Basophils/immunology', '*Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Immunologic Techniques', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/immunology', 'Reference Standards', 'Transfection']",2005/06/23 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ALL803 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00803.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2005 Aug;60(8):1021-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00803.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They represent a major active component of the plant extract and are often known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. Previously, we demonstrated that Ligaria cuneifolia (R et P) Tiegh. (Loranthaceae) extracts inhibit proliferation of murine mitogen-activated lymphocytes as well as murine T leukaemia (LB) and breast tumor cells (MMT). The aim of this study was to assess the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of three separate flavonoid fractions derived from L. cuneifolia whole extract (aqueous, methanolic and ethyl acetate) on normal and tumor cells. This was performed as a bio-guided approach leading to the isolation and identification of the active compounds responsible for the effects observed with the whole extract. Results showed that the three fractions differed in the amount and type of compounds found. Only the ethyl acetate flavonoid fraction (100 microg/ml) was able to inhibit significantly the proliferation of Con A stimulated splenocytes or LB and MMT cells. Inhibition of proliferation was mediated by apoptosis as determined by morphology and DNA hypodiploidy. The ethyl acetate fraction modified mRNA expression of IL-2, IL-10 and TGF-beta, while the methanol fraction only modified IL-10 mRNA on LB cells. Our results show that the ethyl acetate flavonoid fraction contains the most active compound/s and is the potential candidate to isolate the active compound/s responsible for the effects observed with L. cuneifolia whole extract.","['Cerda Zolezzi, Paula', 'Fernandez, Teresa', 'Aulicino, Paula', 'Cavaliere, Victoria', 'Greczanik, Sofia', 'Caldas Lopes, Eloisi', 'Wagner, Marcelo', 'Ricco, Rafael', 'Gurni, Alberto', 'Hajos, Silvia', 'Alvarez, Elida']","['Cerda Zolezzi P', 'Fernandez T', 'Aulicino P', 'Cavaliere V', 'Greczanik S', 'Caldas Lopes E', 'Wagner M', 'Ricco R', 'Gurni A', 'Hajos S', 'Alvarez E']","['Catedra de Inmunologia, Instituto de Estudios de la Inmunidad Humoral - Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Republica Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'Diploidy', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Loranthaceae/*chemistry', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects']",2005/06/23 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(05)00038-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2005.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2005;209(10):737-49. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2005.03.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms regulating mesoderm commitment to hematopoietic lineages remain poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that the development kinetics and growth factor responsiveness of hematopoietic precursors derived from embryonic stem cells (ES cells) is similar to that found in the yolk sac, indicating that the onset of hematopoiesis within the embryoid bodies (EBs) parallels that found in the embryo. Furthermore, in vitro differentiation of ES cells to hematopoietic cells is valuable for establishment of therapeutic clone against a variety of hematological disorders. Despite the identification of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors in EBs, a subset of more primitive progenitors, identical to the high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) derived from human and murine hematopoietic tissues, have not been clearly identified regarding particular their replating potential in vitro. HPP-CFC is among the most primitive hematopoietic multipotent precursors cultured in vitro. In this study, our aim was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo hematopoietic capacity of HPP-CFC within the day 12 EBs, rather than the expansion of more committed progenitors. In this study the HPP-CFC could be detected within EBs differentiated for 5 to 14 days of murine ES cells, but the development dynamics of the HPP-CFC differed greatly among distinct serum lots. Qualitatively HPP-CFC is capable of forming secondary colonies. As to our expectation the ES cells-derived HPP-CFC demonstrated similar regeneration capacity to those from yolk sac, giving rise to secondary granulocyte, erythrocyte, macrophage and mast cells, however largely differed from the counterparts of adult bone marrow. In addition, by RT-PCR ES cells-derived HPP-CFC were found to express transcription factors associated closely with stem cell proliferation including SCL, GATA-2 and AML1 as well as various receptors of hematopoietic growth factors such as c-kit, GM-CSF receptor and interleukin 3 receptor et al. Finally, in order to understand the in vivo hematopoietic capacity of the ES cells-derived HPP-CFC, spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assay was performed. Nevertheless, typical CFU-S was not observed after transplantation of the day 12 EB cells or HPP-CFC colonies into lethally irradiated adult murine. In conclusion the HPP-CFC differentiated from murine ES cells displayed robust hematopoietic activity in vitro, however their in vivo reconstitution ability was not detected. The difference between in vitro and in vivo hematopoietic activities of ES cells-derived primitive hematopoietic precursors deserves further investigation.","['Liu, Bing', 'Hou, Chun-Mei', 'Wu, Ying', 'Zhang, Shuang-Xi', 'Mao, Ning']","['Liu B', 'Hou CM', 'Wu Y', 'Zhang SX', 'Mao N']","['Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,9426463,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2005/06/23 09:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2005/06/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao. 2003 May;19(3):312-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few patients bank their sperm. The authors evaluated by questionnaire the psychological impact of sperm cryopreservation. METHODS: The authors cryopreserved the sperm of 111 patients with cancer for free at the Yokohama City University (Yokohama, Japan). For the current study, questionnaires were mailed to 66 patients whose sperm had been cryopreserved. Fifty-one patients (77.3%) with testicular carcinomas (n = 24), leukemia or malignant lymphoma (n = 19), or other cancers (n = 8) answered the questionnaire. The average age at collection and the period of sperm cryopreservation were 30.1 +/- 6.0 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 3.3 +/- 2.2 years, respectively. RESULTS: Many patients were informed of the deleterious effects of cancer chemotherapy and worried about infertility in the future. However, only half of the patients banked their sperm on their own initiative. Other patients followed their physician's instruction. Eighty percent of patients replied that sperm cryopreservation helped in the battle against cancer. Sperm banking especially was found to encourage every patient who banked sperm on their own initiative. After cancer chemotherapy, 70% of patients wanted to have a child. However, 60% of patients were worried about infertility in spite of having their sperm cryopreserved. No patients wanted to use cryopreserved sperm for fathering children if their spermatogenesis was restored. Sperm cryopreservation invigorated many patients with cancer after cancer treatments. The majority of patients recommended sperm cryopreservation to other cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sperm cryopreservation encouraged young patients with cancer during and after cancer treatment. It should be recommended for all young patients with cancer. However, sperm cryopreservation did not eliminate their fear of infertility.","['Saito, Kazuo', 'Suzuki, Kotaro', 'Iwasaki, Akira', 'Yumura, Yasushi', 'Kubota, Yoshinobu']","['Saito K', 'Suzuki K', 'Iwasaki A', 'Yumura Y', 'Kubota Y']","['Department of Urology and Kidney Transplantation, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57 Urafune, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 232-0024, Japan. zxb07166@nifty.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*psychology/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', '*Semen Preservation', 'Sperm Banks/statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2005/06/22 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21185 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Aug 1;104(3):521-4. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21185.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,

Nevertheless, only 20-30% of patients with AML achieve long-term disease-free survival after SCT. The most common cause of treatment failure is relapse. Additionally, mortality rates are significantly increased by therapy-related causes such as toxicity of chemotherapy and complications of SCT. Including radioimmunotherapies in the treatment of AML and myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) allows for the achievement of a pronounced antileukaemic effect for the reduction of relapse rates on the one hand. On the other hand, no increase of acute toxicity and later complications should be induced. These effects are important for the primary reduction of tumour cells as well as for the myeloablative conditioning before SCT. This paper provides a systematic and critical review of the currently used radionuclides and immunoconjugates for the treatment of AML and MDS and summarizes the literature on primary tumour cell reductive radioimmunotherapies on the one hand and conditioning radioimmunotherapies before SCT on the other hand.","['Buchmann, I', 'Meyer, R G', 'Herr, W', 'Helisch, A', 'Bartenstein, P']","['Buchmann I', 'Meyer RG', 'Herr W', 'Helisch A', 'Bartenstein P']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Universitatsklinikum Mainz, Langenbeckstr. 1, 55101 Mainz. buchmann@nuklear.klinik.uni-mainz.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

METHODS: Seventy-two cases of t(8;21) AML were analyzed retrospectively, including features of morphology, initial blood cells, cytogenetic G-banding karyotype, immunophenotype, AML1/ETO fusion gene and clinical outcome. In order to compare the characteristics of patients with additional chromosomal abnormalities with those with t(8;21) alone, these patients were divided into two groups according to their karyotype as follows: Group A included patients with t(8;21) alone; Group B included patients with additional aberrations. RESULTS: According to FAB classification, there were 65 cases of M2, 5 cases of M4 and 2 of M5. Cytogenetically, 45 cases (62.5%) were accompanied by additional chromosomal abnormalities. The main additional aberrations included -Y, +4, del(9q). There were no obvious differences between these two groups in their features of age distribution, bone marrow blast cells, Auer rods, eosinophilia, immunophenotype, as well as central nervous system leukemia occurrence and complete remission rate of induction, but a male prevalence and a lower initial WBC were observed in Group B.

METHODS: From Mar 2000 to Jul 2004, 32 patients with Ph+ ALL were treated by Allo-HSCT, and the follow up ended at Dec 30.2004 with medium of 13 months. Of whom, 24 were male, and 8 were female. Twenty-three patients have been transplanted in CR1, 9 patients beyond CR1 (1 in CR2, 8 in refractory or relapse status). Twelve cases received HSCT from identical sibling donor, 4 unrelated Cord Blood Transplantation (CBT), 3 HSCT from matched unrelated donor (MUD), and 13 HSCT from mismatched related donor (MMRD), of which, 6 cases were M(BCR/ABL) subtype, and 20 m(BCR/ABL) subtype. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and relapse incidence (RI), and the factors were compared by means of the Log-rank test. Simultaneous effect of multiple covariates were estimated with Cox model. RESULTS: Of all the 32 cases engrafted, 4-year OS was 57.19%, LFS 37.09%, and RI 56.36%. In univariate prognostic analysis model, the OS was higher in CR1 group pre-HSCT than that in non-CR1 group (74.50% vs 22.22%, P=0.0046), LFS was higher (49.06% vs 11.11%, P=0.0057), RI was lower (44.80% vs 84.76%, P=0.0157); the OS was higher in M(BCR/ABL) group than that in m(BCR/ABL) group (100% vs 40.91%, P=0.0318), LFS was higher (75% vs 17.72%, P=0.0057), RI was lower (25% vs 77.88, P=0.0116); OS was similar in HLA MM RD group to that in HLA identical group (52.65% vs 55.56%, P=0.6247), LFS was similar (45.12% vs 30.00%, P=0.8315), and RI was also similar (50.77% vs 60.62%, P=0.8217). In multiple covariate analysis model, the BCR/ABL type was the risk factor of LFS [P=0.005, Exp(B)=9.971] and RI (P=0.006, Exp(B)=9.488), the status of disease pre-HSCT and BCR/ABL subtype was the risk factor of OS [P was 0.010 and 0.038, Exp(B) was 4.532 and 37.537 respectively]. CONCLUSION: We had better do HSCT in CR1 to treat Ph+ ALL, if patient is refractory to chemotherapy, we can try STI571, and HSCT should be done as soon as possible if the patients get CR. Mismatched related donor is considered as regular donor for Ph+ ALL patients without identical donors. We should pay more attention to monitoring and prophylaxis of relapse in m(BCR/ABL) patients after HSCT.","['Xu, Lan-ping', 'Huang, Xiao-jun', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Chen, Huan', 'Liu, Dai-hong', 'Zhang, Yao-chen', 'Chen, Yu-hong', 'Han, Wei', 'Gao, Zhi-yong', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Xu LP', 'Huang XJ', 'Liu KY', 'Chen H', 'Liu DH', 'Zhang YC', 'Chen YH', 'Han W', 'Gao ZY', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

At the last follow-up, the number of patients in molecular or cytogenetic remission was 29 and 13, respectively. Overall survival and progression-free survival after relapse were 53.6% (95% CI: 42.9--64.2) and 52% (95% CI: 41-63) at 5 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, survival was significantly related to CML phase at relapse (cytogenetic or chronic phase vs advanced phases) and time from transplant to relapse (<1 vs >or=1 year). Patients with no adverse factors had a better survival compared with patients with one or two adverse features (65 vs 35 vs 0%, respectively). We conclude that a significant proportion of CML patients that relapse after transplantation can regain complete and long-lasting remissions with one or more salvage therapies.

To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.","['Rossi, Derrick J', 'Bryder, David', 'Zahn, Jacob M', 'Ahlenius, Henrik', 'Sonu, Rebecca', 'Wagers, Amy J', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Rossi DJ', 'Bryder D', 'Zahn JM', 'Ahlenius H', 'Sonu R', 'Wagers AJ', 'Weissman IL']","['Department of Pathology and Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. drossi@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transplantation', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Software', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/06/22 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['0503280102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0503280102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Jun 28;102(26):9194-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0503280102.

A number of studies have attempted to identify risk factors for neutropenia and its consequences to develop predictive models capable of identifying patients at greater risk for such complications and to guide more effective and cost-effective applications of the colony-stimulating factors. A systematic review of the literature showed that age, performance status, nutritional status, chemotherapy dose intensity, and low baseline blood cell counts were associated with the risk of severe and febrile neutropenia or reduced chemotherapy dose intensity in multivariate analysis in two or more studies. Similarly, age, diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma, high temperature or low blood pressure at admission, and i.v. site infection along with low blood cell counts and organ dysfunction were associated with serious medical complications of febrile neutropenia, including bacteremia and death. The available risk model studies, however, had several limitations, including retrospective analyses of small study populations lacking independent validation, frequent missing values, and differences in the predictive factors considered.

Here, we report that musculin/MyoR is expressed in adult kidney side population (SP) cells and can regulate their function. SP phenotype can be used to purify stem cell-rich fractions. Microarray analysis clarified that musculin/MyoR was exclusively expressed in kidney SP cells, and the cells resided in the renal interstitial space. Musculin/MyoR-positive cells were decreased in acute renal failure, but infusion of kidney SP cells increased musculin/MyoR-positive cells and improved renal function. Kidney SP cells in reversible acute renal failure expressed a high level of renoprotective factors and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but not in irreversible chronic renal failure. In cultured kidney SP cells, LIF stimulated gene expression of renoprotective factors, and down-regulation of musculin/MyoR augmented LIF-induced gene expression. Our results suggest that musculin/MyoR may play important roles not only in developmental processes but also in regenerative processes in adult tissue.","['Hishikawa, Keiichi', 'Marumo, Takeshi', 'Miura, Shigeki', 'Nakanishi, Asato', 'Matsuzaki, Yumi', 'Shibata, Katsunori', 'Ichiyanagi, Tomoko', 'Kohike, Hiroko', 'Komori, Takuya', 'Takahashi, Ichiro', 'Takase, Osamu', 'Imai, Naohiko', 'Yoshikawa, Masahiro', 'Inowa, Toshihiko', 'Hayashi, Matsuhiko', 'Nakaki, Toshio', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Okano, Hideyuki', 'Fujita, Toshiro']","['Hishikawa K', 'Marumo T', 'Miura S', 'Nakanishi A', 'Matsuzaki Y', 'Shibata K', 'Ichiyanagi T', 'Kohike H', 'Komori T', 'Takahashi I', 'Takase O', 'Imai N', 'Yoshikawa M', 'Inowa T', 'Hayashi M', 'Nakaki T', 'Nakauchi H', 'Okano H', 'Fujita T']","['Department of Clinical Renal Regeneration, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. hishikawa-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Ostn protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kidney/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Regeneration/drug effects/*physiology', 'Renal Insufficiency/metabolism/physiopathology/therapy', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism']",2005/06/22 09:00,2005/08/23 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200412167 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200412167 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2005 Jun 20;169(6):921-8. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200412167.,,,,,,PMC2171631,,,,,,,,

Development of safe and effective MDR reversing agents is an important approach in the clinic. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of CJX1, an amlodipine derivative, on the inhibition of P-gp function and P-gp-mediated MDR in K562/DOX cells and parental K562 cells. Based on the flow cytometric technology, the uptake, accumulation and efflux of rhodamine123 (Rh123) were detected in these cells by measuring Rh123-associated mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The effects of CJX1 on the doxorubicin cytotoxicity were evaluated by assaying for MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction and the reversal fold (RF) values. The DNA content, percentage of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were monitored with flow cytometry. Intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin was also assessed by the determination of doxorubicin-associated MFI. Verapamil was employed as a comparative agent. Incubation of K562/DOX cells with CJX1 caused a marked increase in uptake and a notable decrease in efflux of Rh123, No such results were found in parental K562 cells. The inhibitory effect of the agent of P-gp function was reversible, but it persisted at least for 90 min after removal of 2.5 microM CJX1 from incubation medium. The doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and cell cycle perturbations were significantly potentiated by CJX1. The intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin was enhanced in the presence of various concentrations of CJX1. The CJX1 exhibited potent effects in vitro in the reversal of P-gp-mediated MDR, suggesting that the compound may become a candidate of effective MDR reversing agent in cancer chemotherapy.","['Ji, Bian-Sheng', 'He, Ling', 'Liu, Guo-Qing']","['Ji BS', 'He L', 'Liu GQ']","[""Department of Pharmacology, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing 210009, The People's Republic of China. jibianshen@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CJX1, amlodipine derivative)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '1J444QC288 (Amlodipine)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amlodipine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Time Factors', 'Verapamil']",2005/06/22 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2004/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(05)00451-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2004.12.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2005 Sep 16;77(18):2221-32. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2004.12.050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sequenced the translocation breakpoints of 56 patients with childhood ALL or AML harboring t(12;21), t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), and t(1;19), and demonstrated, with the notable exception of t(1;19), that these rearrangements are commonly detected in the neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards) of the cases. These findings show that most childhood leukemias begin before birth and that maternal and perinatal exposures such as chemical and infectious agents are likely to be critical. Indeed, we have reported that exposure to indoor pesticides during pregnancy and the first year of life raises leukemia risk, but that later exposures do not. We have also examined aberrant gene methylation in different cytogenetic subgroups and have found striking differences between them, suggesting that epigenetic events are also important in the development of some forms of childhood leukemia. Further, at least two studies now show that the inactivating NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO1) C609T polymorphism is positively associated with leukemias arising in the first 1-2 years of life and polymorphisms in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been associated with adult and childhood ALL. Thus, low folate intake and compounds that are detoxified by NQO1 may be important in elevating leukemia risk in children. Finally, we are exploring the use of proteomics to subclassify leukemia, because cytogenetic analysis is costly and time-consuming. Several proteins have been identified that may serve as useful biomarkers for rapidly identifying different forms of childhood leukemia.","['Smith, Martyn T', 'McHale, Cliona M', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Zheng, Shichun', 'Gunn, Laura', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Smith MT', 'McHale CM', 'Wiemels JL', 'Zhang L', 'Wiencke JK', 'Zheng S', 'Gunn L', 'Skibola CF', 'Ma X', 'Buffler PA']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, 140 Warren Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA. martynts@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/06/22 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2004/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(05)00104-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2004.11.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2005 Aug 7;206(2):237-45. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2004.11.026.,55,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES0098137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Characteristic features of this model include sustained proliferation of T cells after initial stimulation, saturated T cell proliferation rate, and the possible elimination of cancer cells, independent of fixed-point stability. In addition, we use numerical simulations to examine the effects of varying initial cell concentrations on the likelihood of a successful transplant. Among the observed trends, we note that higher initial concentrations of donor-derived, anti-host T cells slightly favor the chance of success, while higher initial concentrations of general host blood cells more significantly favor the chance of success. These observations lead to the hypothesis that anti-host T cells benefit from stimulation by general host blood cells, which induce them to proliferate to sufficient levels to eliminate cancer.","['DeConde, Rob', 'Kim, Peter S', 'Levy, Doron', 'Lee, Peter P']","['DeConde R', 'Kim PS', 'Levy D', 'Lee PP']","['Stanford Medical Informatics, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. rdeconde@smi.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['*Computer Simulation', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', '*Models, Immunological', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2005/06/22 09:00,2005/12/20 09:00,['2005/06/22 09:00'],"['2004/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5193(05)00075-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2005 Sep 7;236(1):39-59. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.02.015.

Motexafin gadolinium (MGd) is a synthetic expanded porphyrin that selectively accumulates in tumor cells and oxidizes various intracellular metabolites, including ascorbate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, glutathione, and protein thiols, to generate reactive oxygen species in a process known as futile redox cycling. The rationale for its use in hematologic malignancies is that, like naturally occurring porphyrins, it tends to concentrate selectively in cancer cells, and it has a novel mechanism of action of inducing redox stress and triggering apoptosis in a broad range of malignancies. MGd induces apoptosis in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and highly resistant myeloma cell lines. Furthermore, MGd is additive or synergistic with ionizing radiation, several chemotherapy agents, and rituximab in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Through gene expression profiling, various stress-related genes are upregulated in response to MGd, including genes encoding metallothioneins, heat shock proteins, and heme oxygenase. Preliminary results from clinical trials with MGd in hematopoietic malignancies have shown that it is well tolerated, with minimal hematologic side effects in both; it has single agent activity in very heavily pretreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia /small lymphocytic lymphoma patients, and it has induced prompt complete remissions in combination with 90Yttrium-ibritumomab (Y-90 Zevalin; Biogen Idec Inc., Cambridge, MA) for relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the first two cohorts of patients enrolled.

To further characterize the function of GATA-2, we examined the cellular turnover mechanism of GATA-2. In P815 cells, the half-life of endogenous GATA-2 was found to be as short as 30 min after cycloheximide treatment. This short half-life was reproducible in other hematopoietic and neuroblastoma cell lines with moderate variation. We also found that ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation markedly represses the GATA-2 protein level by facilitating the degradation process. Since treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or clasto-Lactacystin substantially abrogated the effects of cycloheximide and UV-C irradiation and increased the expression level of both endogenous and transfected GATA-2, the degradation of GATA-2 seems to occur through the proteasome pathway. Structure-function analyses with the GAL4-DNA binding domain (GBD)-GATA-2 fusion protein and GATA-2 deletion mutants suggested that the protein degradation regulatory elements of GATA-2 reside in three regions, two of which overlap with the transactivation domain. We also detected poly ubiquitinated forms of GATA-2.

This mechanism is dysregulated in CML and we have developed a self-renewal assay for CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage) which demonstrates that, in CML, the PI (proliferative index) of the myeloid progenitor cell population is increased.

Although autotransplantation of germ cells holds promise for restoring fertility, contamination by leukemic cells may induce relapse. In this study, we isolated germ cells from leukemic mice by FACS sorting. The cell population in the high forward-scatter and low side-scatter regions of dissociated testicular cells from leukemic mice were analyzed by staining for MHC class I heavy chain (H-2K/H-2D) and for CD45. Cells that did not stain positively for H-2K/H-2D and CD45 were sorted as the germ cell-enriched fraction. The sorted germ cell-enriched fractions were transplanted into the testes of recipient mice exposed to alkylating agents. Transplanted germ cells colonized, and recipient mice survived. Normal progeny were produced by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm obtained from recipient testes. When unsorted germ cells from leukemic mice were transplanted into recipient testes, all recipient mice developed leukemia. The successful birth of offspring from recipient mice without transmission of leukemia to the recipients indicates the potential of autotransplantation of germ cells sorted by FACS to treat infertility secondary to anticancer treatment for childhood leukemia.","['Fujita, Kazutoshi', 'Ohta, Hiroshi', 'Tsujimura, Akira', 'Takao, Tetsuya', 'Miyagawa, Yasushi', 'Takada, Shingo', 'Matsumiya, Kiyomi', 'Wakayama, Teruhiko', 'Okuyama, Akihiko']","['Fujita K', 'Ohta H', 'Tsujimura A', 'Takao T', 'Miyagawa Y', 'Takada S', 'Matsumiya K', 'Wakayama T', 'Okuyama A']","['Department of Urology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.

To investigate if Rac3 contributes to normal or malignant cell function, we generated rac3 null mutants through gene targeting. These mice were viable, fertile, and lacked an obvious external phenotype. This shows Rac3 function is dispensable for embryonic development. Bcr/Abl is a deregulated tyrosine kinase that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia and Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in humans. Vav1, a hematopoiesis-specific exchange factor for Rac, was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in primary lymphomas from Bcr/Abl P190 transgenic mice, suggesting inappropriate Rac activation. rac3 is expressed in these malignant hematopoietic cells. Using lysates from BCR/ABL transgenic mice that express or lack rac3, we detected the presence of activated Rac3 but not Rac1 or Rac2 in the malignant precursor B-lineage lymphoblasts. In addition, in female P190 BCR/ABL transgenic mice, lack of rac3 was associated with a longer average survival. These data are the first to directly show a stimulatory role for Rac in leukemia in vivo. Moreover, our data suggest that interference with Rac3 activity, for example, by using geranyl-geranyltransferase inhibitors, may provide a positive clinical benefit for patients with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Cho, Young Jin', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Kaartinen, Vesa', 'Haataja, Leena', 'de Curtis, Ivan', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Cho YJ', 'Zhang B', 'Kaartinen V', 'Haataja L', 'de Curtis I', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology Ms#54, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['EC 3.6.1.- (Rac3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Targeting', '*Genes, abl', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/13/5777 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.13.5777-5785.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Jul;25(13):5777-85. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.13.5777-5785.2005.,,"['CA90321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL071945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL071945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL060231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL060231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1157002,,,,,,,,

We now show that the HAT activity of p300 can also be required for down-regulation of transcription by a DNA binding repressor protein. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), originally identified as a fusion with retinoic acid receptor alpha in rare cases of all-trans-retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia, is a transcriptional repressor that recruits histone deacetylase-containing corepressor complexes to specific DNA binding sites. PLZF associates with p300 in vivo, and its ability to repress transcription is specifically dependent on HAT activity of p300 and acetylation of lysines in its C-terminal C2-H2 zinc finger motif. An acetylation site mutant of PLZF does not repress transcription and is functionally deficient in a colony suppression assay despite retaining its abilities to interact with corepressor/histone deacetylase complexes.

Here we demonstrate that in leukemia cells, NF-kappaB activation by the HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) MS-275 and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid was associated with hyperacetylation and nuclear translocation of RelA/p65. The latter events, as well as the association of RelA/p65 with IkappaBalpha, were strikingly diminished by either coadministration of the IkappaBalpha phosphorylation inhibitor Bay 11-7082 (Bay) or transfection with an IkappaBalpha superrepressor. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by pharmacological inhibitors or genetic strategies markedly potentiated apoptosis induced by HDACIs, and this was accompanied by enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, downregulation of Mn-superoxide dismutase and XIAP, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activation. Conversely, N-acetyl L-cysteine blocked apoptosis induced by Bay/HDACIs by abrogating ROS generation. Inhibition of JNK1 activation attenuated Bay/HDACI lethality without affecting NF-kappaB inactivation and ROS generation. Finally, XIAP overexpression dramatically protected cells against the Bay/HDACI regimen but failed to prevent ROS production and JNK1 activation. Together, these data suggest that HDACIs promote the accumulation of acetylated RelA/p65 in the nucleus, leading to NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, interference with these events by either pharmacological or genetic means leads to a dramatic increase in HDACI-mediated lethality through enhanced oxidative damage, downregulation of NF-kappaB-dependent antiapoptotic proteins, and stress-related JNK1 activation.","['Dai, Yun', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', '*Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'U937 Cells', 'Vorinostat', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/13/5429 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.13.5429-5444.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Jul;25(13):5429-44. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.13.5429-5444.2005.,,"['CA-63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1156999,,,,,,,,

Here we show that NPM acts as a cellular p53 negative regulator to protect normal and malignant hematopoietic cells from stress-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of NPM suppresses stress-induced apoptosis in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent myeloid cell line MO7e and the lymphoblast HSC536 cells derived from a Fanconi anemia (FA) patient. In addition, suppression of NPM expression by small interfering RNA targeting NPM in normal lymphoblasts and FA-associated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells increases DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, overexpression of the mutant NPMDeltaC, which lacks the p53-interacting domain, fails to confer cellular resistance to stress-induced apoptosis, suggesting that NPM protects cells from apoptotic cell death through a mechanism involving p53. Indeed, using the genetically matched p53 wild-type (WT) and null mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, we demonstrate that forced expression of NPM protects against ionizing irradiation (IR)-induced apoptosis of WT but not p53-null BM cells. Moreover, NPM inhibits IR-induced p53 transactivation, and interacts with p53 in hematopoietic cells. Thus, these results indicate an important role for NPM in regulation of p53-dependent apoptotic response and implicate a potential effect in cancer therapy.","['Li, June', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Sejas, Daniel P', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Li J', 'Zhang X', 'Sejas DP', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/*genetics']",2005/06/21 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00191-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Dec;29(12):1415-23. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.05.005.

An increasing number of genetic aberrations, such as chromosomal translocations that alter the function of transcription regulatory factors, has been identified as the cause of AML and shown to act by deregulating gene programming at both the genetic and epigenetic level. While the genetic aberrations occurring in acute myeloid leukemia are fairly well understood, we have only recently become aware of the epigenetic deregulation associated with leukemia, in particular with myeloid leukemias. The deposition of epigenetic ""marks"" on chromatin - post-translational modifications of nucleosomal proteins and methylation of particular DNA sequences - is accomplished by enzymes, which are often embedded in multi-subunit ""machineries"" that have acquired aberrant functionalities during leukemogenesis. These enzymes are targets for so-called ""epi-drugs"". Indeed, recent results indicate that epi-drugs may constitute an entirely novel type of anti-cancer drugs with unanticipated potential. Proof-of-principle comes from studies with histone deacetylase inhibitors, promising novel anti-cancer drugs.

To explore the requirement for polyQ tracks in educing such cellular responses, we examined whether a non-polyQ protein can deposit as nuclear aggregates and elicit similar responses. We report that a protein chimera (GFP170*) composed of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to an internal fragment of the Golgi Complex Protein (GCP-170) forms nuclear aggregates analogous to those formed by polyQ proteins. Like the polyQ nuclear aggregates, GFP170* inclusions recruit molecular chaperones and proteasomal components, alter nuclear structures containing the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), recruit transcriptional factors such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p53, repress p53 transcriptional activity, and induce cell death.

The international scoring system to help discriminate between CLL and other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders lists this as the first of 5 criteria worth 1 point each. In the present study, 30 cases of CLL were studied for surface and cytoplasmic Ig expression. 23 of these 30 (76.7%) cases were positive for sIg. Of these 23, 14 cases (60.9%) showed moderate to bright sIg expression. All of these 23 cases were positive for CD5 and CD23; all were negative for CD10 and only 6 (26.1%) were positive for FMC7. 27 of 30 (90.0%) cases expressed cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (cIg) compared to 5% reported by others. This shows that cytoplasmic Ig occurs in a much greater percentage of cases than reported previously. 23 of 30 (76.7%) cases showed positivity for both surface and cytoplasmic Ig, with 15 showing kappa light chain restriction and 8 showing lambda light chain restriction. Six expressed cytoplasmic Ig only, with 4 showing kappa light chain restriction and 2 showing lambda light chain restriction. One case expressed neither cytoplasmic nor surface Ig.

Stimulation with VP16, however, induces typical apoptosis in both cell lines. Necrosis in CEM cells, characterized by cell shrinkage and clustering, began within 5 min of treatment. Swelling of the mitochondria, lumpy chromatin condensation and intact plasma membranes were evident by electron microscopy. These A23187-mediated changes in CEM cells were suppressed by clonazepam or CGP37157, inhibitors of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. The changes, however, were not affected by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. In both CEM and HL60 cells, intra-cellular calcium increased with similar amplitude within 1 min of treatment with 2 microM A23187. Intra-mitochondrial calcium increased with clonazepam pre-treatment alone in both CEM and HL60 cells. However, intra-mitochondrial calcium did not change drastically in response to A23187 in CEM or HL60 cells, either untreated or pre-treated with clonazepam. A23187 induces necrosis in CEM cells concurrent with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is independent of the mitochondrial permeability transition, but affected by intra-mitochondrial calcium, while HL60 cells lack these early changes. Differences in the responses to A23187 between these two cell lines might derive from differences in the susceptibility of the mitochondrial membrane to rapid increases in intra-cellular calcium.","['Hamahata, Keigo', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Matsubara, Hiroshi', 'Okada, Masayuki', 'Imai, Tsuyoshi', 'Watanabe, Ken-ichiro', 'Toyokuni, Shin-ya', 'Ueno, Masaki', 'Wakabayashi, Shigeo', 'Katanosaka, Yuki', 'Akiba, Satoshi', 'Kubota, Masaru', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi']","['Hamahata K', 'Adachi S', 'Matsubara H', 'Okada M', 'Imai T', 'Watanabe K', 'Toyokuni SY', 'Ueno M', 'Wakabayashi S', 'Katanosaka Y', 'Akiba S', 'Kubota M', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiazepines)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5PE9FDE8GB (Clonazepam)', '75450-34-9 (CGP 37157)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Clonazepam/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Necrosis', 'Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Thiazepines/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/08/30 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(05)00415-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.04.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2005 Jun 15;516(3):187-96. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.04.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We constructed a nonviral, transposon-based vector system for the stable knockdown of PgP in chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines resistant to imatinib and doxorubicin. RESULTS: Using this strategy, PgP expression was completely knocked down 72 hours after vector inoculation and lasted for several months. Cellular efflux of the PgP substates rhodamine and doxorubicin was abolished. Vector-treated cells were resensitized to imatinib- and doxorubicin-induced cell death.

The second objective was to determine whether the rapid induction of ADD2 expression could be attributed to a novel erythroid-specific promoter. METHODS: Expression of mRNA was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. Primary erythroid precursors were isolated from normal human bone marrow using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Two model systems were compared: CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells induced to differentiate with erythropoietin and HEL cells induced to differentiate with hemin. 5'RACE analysis was performed using primary human erythroblasts as starting material. RESULTS: All three adducin genes showed different patterns of expression during erythropoietic differentiation of cultured CD34(+) stem cells. Levels of ADD3 mRNA were higher than levels of ADD2 mRNA at early stages of erythropoiesis. Expression of ADD2 was induced to very high levels (100 times baseline) in erythropoietin-stimulated cultures. 5'RACE analysis identified a novel starting exon and putative erythroid promoter for ADD2. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that expression of each adducin gene is regulated in a gene-specific manner during erythropoiesis.

Earlier recognition of the importance of bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironments has evolved into the recognition of specific niches that regulate stem cell pool size, proliferative status, mobilization, and differentiation. The discovery of the role of multiple hematopoietic growth factors and their receptors in the orchestration of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation has been followed by recognition of the importance of the Notch and Wnt pathways. The homeobox family of transcription factors serve as master regulators of development and are increasingly found to be critical regulators of hematopoiesis. In parallel with this understanding of normal hematopoiesis has come a recognition that stem cell dysregulation at various levels is involved in leukemogenesis. Furthermore, the progression from chronic leukemia or myelodysplasia to acute leukemia involves accumulation of at least two mutational events that lead to enhancement of stem cell proliferation, or acquisition of stem cell behavior by a progenitor cell, coupled with maturation inhibition. Translocations resulting in development of oncogenic fusion genes are found in AML and the transforming potential of two of these, AML1-ETO and NUP98-HOXA9, will be discussed. Secondary, constitutively activating mutations of the Flt3 and c-kit receptors and of K- and N-ras are found with high frequency in AML, and the transforming potential of mutated FLT3 and the role of STAT5A activation in human stem cell transformation will be reviewed.","['Moore, Malcolm A S']",['Moore MA'],"['James Ewing Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. m-moore@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00209-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Jul;33(7):719-37. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.04.011.,214,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymph node samples from 11 healthy dogs were labeled to validate the specificity of antibodies and to formulate guidelines for interpretation of the results obtained from lymphoma samples. In normal lymph nodes, T-lymphocytes expressing CD3, CD4, or CD8 beta represented 59+/-11%, 43+/-8%, or 16+/-5% of the total cells, whereas B-lymphocytes expressing either CD21 or surface IgM (IgM) represented 37+/-9% or 14+/-5%, respectively. Small lymphocytes could be distinguished from large lymphocytes by forward light scatter. Of the patient samples 29 different breeds were represented with Golden and Labrador retriever being the most common. The lymphoma samples segregated into three groups based on CD antigen expression. Thirty cases predominantly expressed one or more combinations of CD79a, IgM, and CD21 representing a B-cell lineage. Three B-cell cases also expressed the stem cell antigen, CD34. Sixteen cases expressed one or more combinations of CD3, CD4, and CD8 consistent with a T-cell lineage and CD3+CD4+CD8--phenotype was the most common. Thirteen cases showed a mixed expression profile for T- and B-cell antigens and in three cases CD14 was highly expressed. Clinical response was poorest for T-cell lymphomas. Leukemic states occurred in all three phenotypes; but mixed cell cases had the greatest proportion. Dual immunofluorescence staining confirmed co-expression of T-cell (CD3) and B-cell antigens (CD79a or CD21) on neoplastic lymphocytes of six mixed cell cases. In one mixed cell case, dual immunostaining identified lymphocyte populations that stained mutually exclusive for CD79a and CD3. Six mixed cell lymphomas tested by PCR showed clonality for rearranged antigen receptor. Four cases that were CD79a+CD3+ had TCRgamma chain gene rearrangements, whereas two cases that were CD3+CD8+CD21+ had Ig heavy chain rearrangement. One case expressing multiple CD molecules (CD3+CD8+CD21+CD14+) was PCR negative for both Ig and TCRgamma gene rearrangement and could not be classified into a B- or T-cell lineage. We show for the first time co-expression of B- and T-cell markers on lymphoma cells that had specific T- or B-cell gene rearrangements. These findings suggest that aberrant CD molecule expression is not an uncommon finding in canine lymphomas and is a useful diagnostic marker for malignancy.","['Wilkerson, M J', 'Dolce, K', 'Koopman, T', 'Shuman, W', 'Chun, R', 'Garrett, L', 'Barber, L', 'Avery, A']","['Wilkerson MJ', 'Dolce K', 'Koopman T', 'Shuman W', 'Chun R', 'Garrett L', 'Barber L', 'Avery A']","['Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA. wilkersn@vet.ksu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dog Diseases/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2004/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(05)00068-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2005.02.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2005 Jul 15;106(3-4):179-96. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2005.02.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Together, our results were (1) paclitaxel mainly induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cells (p<0.001); (2) time (p<0.001)- and dose-dependent (p<0.001) apoptosis of HL-60 cells was induced by paclitaxel; (3) in HL-60 cells, z-VAD-fmk blocked paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (12 h: p<0.001; 24 h: p<0.01; 48 h: p<0.01; 72 h: p<0.001) and caspase-3 activation (12 h: p<0.05; 24 h: p<0.01; 48 h: p<0.01; 72 h: p<0.01).

These syncytia result from the fusion of infected cells with uninfected cells. Due to the intrinsic difficulty of infecting cells with cell-free HTLV-I virions, syncytium formation has become an important tool in the study of HTLV-I infection and transmission. Since most HTLV-I-based cell fusion assays rely on the use of non-T cells, the aim of this study was to optimize a new HTLV-I-induced cell fusion assay in which HTLV-I-infected T cell lines are co-cultured with T cells that have been transfected with an HTLV-I long terminal repeat (LTR) luciferase reporter construct. We demonstrate that co-culture of various HTLV-I-infected T cells with different transfected T cell lines resulted in induction of luciferase activity. Cell-to-cell contact and expression of the viral gp46 envelope protein was crucial for this induction while other cell surface proteins (including HSC70) did not have a significant effect. This quantitative assay was shown to be very sensitive. In this assay, the cell fusion-mediated activation of NF-kappaB and the HTLV-I LTR occurred through previously described Tax-dependent signaling pathways. This assay also showed that cell fusion could activate Tax-inducible cellular promoters. These results thus demonstrate that this new quantitative HTLV-I-dependent cell fusion assay is versatile, highly sensitive, and can provide an important tool to investigate cellular promoter activation and intrinsic signaling cascades that modulate cellular gene expression.","['Pare, Marie-Eve', 'Gauthier, Sonia', 'Landry, Sebastien', 'Sun, Jiangfeng', 'Legault, Eric', 'Leclerc, Denis', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Marriott, Susan J', 'Tremblay, Michel J', 'Barbeau, Benoit']","['Pare ME', 'Gauthier S', 'Landry S', 'Sun J', 'Legault E', 'Leclerc D', 'Tanaka Y', 'Marriott SJ', 'Tremblay MJ', 'Barbeau B']","['Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Virion/immunology']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00297-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.05.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Aug 1;338(2):309-22. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.05.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggested the therapeutic potential of cEPA as a leading anti-cancer compound that poisons pols.","['Yonezawa, Yuko', 'Hada, Takahiko', 'Uryu, Keisuke', 'Tsuzuki, Tsuyoshi', 'Eitsuka, Takahiro', 'Miyazawa, Teruo', 'Murakami-Nakai, Chikako', 'Yoshida, Hiromi', 'Mizushina, Yoshiyuki']","['Yonezawa Y', 'Hada T', 'Uryu K', 'Tsuzuki T', 'Eitsuka T', 'Miyazawa T', 'Murakami-Nakai C', 'Yoshida H', 'Mizushina Y']","['Laboratory of Food & Nutritional Sciences, Department of Nutritional Science, Kobe-Gakuin University, Nishi-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 651-2180, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 5.99.1.- (DNA Topoisomerases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase Inhibitors']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00321-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Aug 1;70(3):453-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.05.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of our experiments indicate that SLC22A16 is a mediator of doxorubicin uptake in cancer cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses show that SLC22A16 is expressed in primary samples taken from patients with acute leukemia. Xenopus oocytes injected with SLC22A16 cRNA import doxorubicin, a widely used anticancer drug for hematological malignancies, in a saturable and dose-dependent manner. The apparent Km value for doxorubicin import was 5.2+/-0.4 microM. In cytotoxic assays, stable transfectants of leukemic Jurkat cells overexpressing SLC22A16 cells became significantly more sensitive to doxorubicin (2 microM) treatment.

These hematopoietic cell line-derived DCs are highly pure and monotypic, and display the morphologic, phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of DCs generated from human donor-derived monocytes or CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. During differentiation into mature DCs, the cells exhibit de novo cell-surface expression of CD83, CD80, CD86, CD40, CD206, CD209, CD120a, CD120b, and intracellular synthesis of IL-10, increase their endocytotic capacity, and acquire characteristic stellate morphology. To further define the cells as DCs, cytosolic induction and upregulation of RelB and RelA (p65), transcription factors of the NF-kappaB/Rel family essential for differentiation and maturation of DCs, as well as upregulation of the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1, and the proteasome activator PA28alpha, components essential for efficient MHC class I peptide antigen processing, were demonstrated during differentiation of the cells. In contrast to the cell lines, the cell line-derived mature DCs are capable of stimulating allogeneic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, ultimately defining them as potent antigen-presenting cells. The approach to differentiate THP-1 and KG-1 cells into immature and mature DCs may serve as an experimental model to study molecular events and pathways that govern the differentiation of human malignant myeloid precursors, monocytes, and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells into DCs.","['Berges, Carsten', 'Naujokat, Cord', 'Tinapp, Sarah', 'Wieczorek, Hubert', 'Hoh, Alexandra', 'Sadeghi, Mahmoud', 'Opelz, Gerhard', 'Daniel, Volker']","['Berges C', 'Naujokat C', 'Tinapp S', 'Wieczorek H', 'Hoh A', 'Sadeghi M', 'Opelz G', 'Daniel V']","['Institute of Immunology, Department of Transplantation Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 305, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/immunology', '*Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)01180-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.171 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Aug 5;333(3):896-907. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.171.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New modular drug delivery systems were proposed consisting of a multiplying unit with the property of carrying several drug moieties and an addressing unity with high selectivity for target cells. Following this concept, two new fullerene-bis-pyropheophorbide a derivatives were synthesized: a mono-(FP1) and a hexa-adduct (FHP1). The photophysical characterization of the compounds revealed significantly different parameters related to the number of addends at the fullerene core. In this study, the derivatives were tested with regard to their intracellular uptake and photosensitizing activity towards human leukemia T-lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) in comparison with the free sensitizer, pyropheophorbide a. The C(60)-hexa-adduct FHP1 resulted to have a significative phototoxic activity (58% dead cell, after a dose of 400 mJ/cm(2), 688 nm) while the mono-adduct FP1 had a very low phototoxicity and only at higher light doses. The photosensitizing activity of the fullerene hexa-adduct, FHP1, resulted to be lower than that of pyropheophorbide a. The lesser intracellular concentration reached by the C(60)-hexa-adduct FHP1 is probably the reason for its lower phototoxicity with respect to pyropheophorbide a.","['Rancan, Fiorenza', 'Helmreich, Matthias', 'Molich, Andreas', 'Jux, Norbert', 'Hirsch, Andreas', 'Roder, Beate', 'Witt, Christian', 'Bohm, Fritz']","['Rancan F', 'Helmreich M', 'Molich A', 'Jux N', 'Hirsch A', 'Roder B', 'Witt C', 'Bohm F']","['Humboldt Universitat, Universitatsklinikum Charite, Hautklinik, Photobiologisches Labor, Berlin, Germany. fiorenaza.rancan@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Two other bisdioxopiperazine derivatives, probimane (Pro) and MST-16, were synthesized at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Cytotoxic activities and mechanisms of Raz (+)-steroisomer (ICRF-187, dexrazoxane), Pro and MST-16 against tumor cells were evaluated by MTT colorimetry, flow cytometry and karyotyping. RESULTS: Pro was cytotoxic to human tumor cell lines in vitro (IC50<50 microM for 48 h). Four human tumor cell lines (SCG-7901, K562, A549 and HL60) were susceptible to Pro at low inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values < 10 microM for 48 h). Although the IC50 against HeLa cell line of vincristine (VCR, 4.56 microM), doxorubicin (Dox, 1.12 microM) and 5-fluoruouracil (5-Fu, 0.232 microM) are lower than Pro (5.12 microM), ICRF-187 (129 microM) and MST-16 (26.4 microM), VCR, Dox and 5-Fu shows a low dose-related - high cytotoxic activity. Time-response studies showed that the cytotoxic effects of Pro are increased for 3 days in human tumor cells, whereas VCR, Dox and 5-Fu showed decreased cytotoxic action after 24 h. Cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and chromosome segregation blocking by Pro and MST-16 were noted. Although there was similar effects of Pro and MST-16 on chromosome segregation blocking action and cell cycle G2/M phase arrest at 1- 4 microM, cytotoxicity of Pro against tumor cells was higher than that of MST-16 in vitro by a factor of 3- 10 folds. Our data show that Pro may be more effective against lung cancer and leukemia while ICRF-187 and MST-16 shows similar IC50 values only against leukemia. CONCLUSION: It suggests that Pro has a wider spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human tumor cells than other bisdioxopiperazines, especially against solid tumors, and with a single cytotoxic pathway of Pro and MST-16 affecting chromosome segregation and leading also to cell G2/ M phase arrests, which finally reduces cell division rates. Pro may be more potent than MST-16 in cytotoxicity. High dose- and time- responses of Pro, when compared with VCR, 5-Fu and Dox, were seen that suggest a selectivity of Pro against tumor growth. Compounds of bisdioxopiperazines family may keep up their cytotoxic effects longer than many other anticancer drugs.","['Lu, Da Yong', 'Huang, Min', 'Xu, Cheng Hui', 'Yang, Wei Yi', 'Hu, Chao Xin', 'Lin, Li Ping', 'Tong, Lin Jiang', 'Li, Mei Hong', 'Lu, Wei', 'Zhang, Xiong Wen', 'Ding, Jian']","['Lu DY', 'Huang M', 'Xu CH', 'Yang WY', 'Hu CX', 'Lin LP', 'Tong LJ', 'Li MH', 'Lu W', 'Zhang XW', 'Ding J']","['School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200436, PR China. ludayong@sh163.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Pharmacol,BMC pharmacology,100967806,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '108093-90-9 (probimane)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'R1308VH37P (sobuzoxane)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chromosome Segregation/*drug effects', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Razoxane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",2005/06/21 09:00,2006/02/02 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2210-5-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2210-5-11 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pharmacol. 2005 Jun 20;5:11. doi: 10.1186/1471-2210-5-11.,,,20050620,,,PMC1180833,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed in 371 patients receiving 400 mg imatinib once daily during a phase III trial of imatinib vs interferon-alfa plus cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed CP CML. Covariates included age, weight, sex, ethnicity, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, white blood cell (WBC) count, liver function, and creatinine concentration. Blood samples for imatinib analysis were taken on treatment days 1 and 29. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was used for the population pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: Population mean estimates (95% confidence interval) at day 1 for apparent clearance (CL) and apparent volume of distribution (V) of imatinib were 14 (13-15) l h(-1) and 252 (237-267) l, respectively. Modelling suggested that CL decreased by 4 (3-5) l h(-1) from day 1 to day 29, whereas V remained unchanged. Interindividual variability in CL and V was 32% and 31%, respectively. Weight, Hb, and WBC count demonstrated small effects on CL and V. Doubling body weight or Hb or halving the WBC count was associated with a 12%, 86% and 8% increase in CL, respectively, and a 32%, 60% and 5% increase in V, respectively. Comedications showed no clear effects on imatinib CL.

In the same period, the role of apoptosis in the tumour process has also gained increasing importance. It is the purpose of this review to describe the apoptotic process, discuss selected papers in which apoptosis is examined in cells exposed to magnetic fields and describe the possible biophysical mechanisms responsible for changes in the apoptotic process in exposed cells. Despite some differences, as a whole, the literature seems to demonstrate that magnetic fields induce changes in apoptosis in cells exposed to different experimental protocols. In addition, the important role of ions, particularly of Ca2+, in the apoptotic process is also discussed, and one possible model for magnetic field action on apoptosis that brings together experimental observations of different nature is suggested and discussed.","['Santini, M T', 'Ferrante, A', 'Rainaldi, G', 'Indovina, P', 'Indovina, P L']","['Santini MT', 'Ferrante A', 'Rainaldi G', 'Indovina P', 'Indovina PL']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, Oncologia e Medicina Molecolare, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. santini@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/21 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2005/06/21 09:00'],"['2005/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000400029502 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2005 Jan;81(1):1-11. doi: 10.1080/09553000400029502.,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients (N = 9,796) were observed from the start of adjuvant treatment (53,080 patient-years). Cases of AML or MDS (AML/MDS) were reported, with disease characteristics. Incidence and cumulative risk were compared for possible risk factors, for assigned regimens, and for administered cumulative doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: In 7,110 patients treated with epirubicin-containing regimens (92% of whom also received cyclophosphamide), 8-year cumulative probability of AML/MDS was 0.55% (95% CI, 0.33% to 0.78%). The risk of developing AML/MDS increased in relation to planned epirubicin dose per cycle, planned epirubicin dose-intensity, and administered cumulative doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Patients with administered cumulative doses of both epirubicin and cyclophosphamide not exceeding those used in standard regimens (</= 720 mg/m(2) and </= 6,300 mg/m(2), respectively) had an 8-year cumulative probability of developing AML/MDS of 0.37% (95% CI, 0.13% to 0.61%) compared with 4.97% (95% CI, 2.06% to 7.87%) for patients administered higher cumulative doses of both epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with standard cumulative doses of adjuvant epirubicin (</= 720 mg/m(2)) and cyclophosphamide (</= 6,300 mg/m(2)) for early breast cancer have a lower probability of secondary leukemia than patients treated with higher cumulative doses. Increased risk of secondary leukemia must be considered when assessing the potential benefit to risk ratio of higher than standard doses.","['Praga, Claudio', 'Bergh, Jonas', 'Bliss, Judith', 'Bonneterre, Jacques', 'Cesana, Bruno', 'Coombes, R Charles', 'Fargeot, Pierre', 'Folin, Annika', 'Fumoleau, Pierre', 'Giuliani, Rosa', 'Kerbrat, Pierre', 'Hery, Michel', 'Nilsson, Jonas', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Piccart, Martine', 'Shepherd, Lois', 'Therasse, Patrick', 'Wils, Jacques', 'Rogers, David']","['Praga C', 'Bergh J', 'Bliss J', 'Bonneterre J', 'Cesana B', 'Coombes RC', 'Fargeot P', 'Folin A', 'Fumoleau P', 'Giuliani R', 'Kerbrat P', 'Hery M', 'Nilsson J', 'Onida F', 'Piccart M', 'Shepherd L', 'Therasse P', 'Wils J', 'Rogers D']","['Centre Oscar Lambret, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Epirubicin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors']",2005/06/18 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/18/4179 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 20;23(18):4179-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the efficacy of lintuzumab in combination with induction chemotherapy was compared with chemotherapy alone in adults with first relapsed or primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or primary resistant AML (duration of first response, zero to 12 months) were randomly assigned to receive either mitoxantrone 8 mg/m(2), etoposide 80 mg/m(2), and cytarabine 1 g/m(2) daily for 6 days (MEC) in combination with lintuzumab 12 mg/m(2), or MEC alone. Overall response, defined as the rate of complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), was the primary end point of the study, with additional analyses of survival time and toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were randomly assigned from November 1999 to April 2001. The percent CR plus CRp with MEC plus lintuzumab was 36% v 28% in patients treated with MEC alone (P = .28). The overall median survival was 156 days and was not different in the two arms of the study. Apart from mild antibody infusion-related toxicities (fever, chills, and hypotension), no differences in chemotherapy-related adverse effects, including hepatic and cardiac dysfunction, were observed with the addition of lintuzumab to induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The addition of lintuzumab to salvage induction chemotherapy was safe, but did not result in a statistically significant improvement in response rate or survival in patients with refractory/relapsed AML.","['Feldman, Eric J', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Stone, Richard', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Moore, Joseph', ""O'Connor, Julie"", 'Wedel, Nancy', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Miller, Carole', 'Chopra, Raj', 'Jurcic, Joseph C', 'Brown, Randy', 'Ehmann, W Christopher', 'Schulman, Philip', 'Frankel, Stanley R', 'De Angelo, Daniel', 'Scheinberg, David']","['Feldman EJ', 'Brandwein J', 'Stone R', 'Kalaycio M', 'Moore J', ""O'Connor J"", 'Wedel N', 'Roboz GJ', 'Miller C', 'Chopra R', 'Jurcic JC', 'Brown R', 'Ehmann WC', 'Schulman P', 'Frankel SR', 'De Angelo D', 'Scheinberg D']","['Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 525 E 68th St, New York, NY 10021, USA. ejf2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/18 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/18/4110 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.09.133 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 20;23(18):4110-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.09.133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study involved 35 patients with neoplasm of the hemopoietic system who underwent hemopoietic cell autotransplantation at the Hematology Clinic (Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland). The patients' nutrition status was assessed using body mass index (BMI) values, body mass components, concentration of albumin, and total protein in blood serum. The clinical status evaluation included duration of hematologic reconstruction, concentration of bilirubin, enzyme activity (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), severity of infections, and duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: Parenteral nutrition was required in 19 patients. Oral feeding was used in 16 patients. Symptoms of malnutrition on the day preceding the introduction of conditioning treatment were recorded only in patients requiring parenteral nutrition (31.6%). In the posttransplantation period, a statistically significant decrease in body mass was observed in both groups, whereas the share of fatty tissue in total body mass was significantly less in patients (men and women) fed parenterally. CONCLUSION: A supply of 25-30 kcal/kg and 1-1.5 g protein/kg/day as an element of parenteral nutrition (where 20%-30% of the energy requirement was covered by fats, 15%-20% by amino acids, and 50%-55% by glucose) helped prevent the development of malnutrition and restore the functions of the hemopoietic system at a level comparable to that for patients fed naturally.","['Skop, A', 'Kolarzyk, Emilia', 'Skotnicki, A B']","['Skop A', 'Kolarzyk E', 'Skotnicki AB']","['Department of Hygiene and Ecology, Jagiellonian University College of Medicine, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,JPEN.

AIMS: To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. METHODS: A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. RESULTS: A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv: 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). CONCLUSIONS: Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.","['Wing, S', 'Richardson, D B']","['Wing S', 'Richardson DB']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7400, USA. steve_wing@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Plutonium/toxicity', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/18 09:00,2005/07/26 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['62/7/465 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2005.019760 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2005 Jul;62(7):465-72. doi: 10.1136/oem.2005.019760.,,['R01/CCR412931/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States'],,,,PMC1741043,,,,,,,,

Stem cell leukemia/T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (SCL/TAL1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, plays key roles in controlling the development of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis during mouse development but its function in adult HSCs is still a matter of debate. We report here that the lentiviral-mediated enforced expression of TAL1 in human CD34+ cells marginally affects in vitro the differentiation of committed progenitors, whereas in vivo the repopulation capacity of the long-term SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mouse-repopulating cells (LT-SRCs) is enhanced. As a consequence, the production of SRC-derived multipotent progenitors as well as erythroid- and myeloid-differentiated cells is increased. Looking at the lymphoid compartment, constitutive TAL1-enforced expression impairs B- but not T-cell differentiation. Expression of a mutant TAL1 protein that cannot bind DNA specifically impairs human LT-SRC amplification, indicating a DNA-binding dependent effect of TAL1 on primitive cell populations. These results indicate that TAL1 expression level regulates immature human hematopoietic cell self-renewal and that this regulation requires TAL1 DNA-binding activity.","['Reynaud, Damien', 'Ravet, Emmanuel', 'Titeux, Monique', 'Mazurier, Frederic', 'Renia, Laurent', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt, Anne', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri', 'Pflumio, Francoise']","['Reynaud D', 'Ravet E', 'Titeux M', 'Mazurier F', 'Renia L', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt A', 'Romeo PH', 'Pflumio F']","['Department of Hematology, Institut Cochin, U567 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR 8104, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",2005/06/18 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67222-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0557 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2318-28. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0557.

Cooperativity between Sox4 and another gene, Mef2c, was subsequently confirmed in transplantation studies, in which deregulated Mef2c expression was shown to accelerate the myeloid leukemia induced by Sox4.

However, the identification of a parsimonious robust prediction model that performs consistently well on future independent data has not been successful due to the biased model selection from an extremely large number of candidate models during the classification model search and construction. Furthermore, common criteria of prediction model performance, such as classification error rates, do not provide a sensitive measure for evaluating performance of such astronomic competing models. Also, even though several different classification approaches have been utilized to tackle such classification problems, no direct comparison on these methods have been made. RESULTS: We introduce a novel measure for assessing the performance of a prediction model, the misclassification-penalized posterior (MiPP), the sum of the posterior classification probabilities penalized by the number of incorrectly classified samples. Using MiPP, we implement a forward step-wise cross-validated procedure to find our optimal prediction models with different numbers of features on a training set. Our final robust classification model and its dimension are determined based on a completely independent test dataset. This MiPP-based classification modeling approach enables us to identify the most parsimonious robust prediction models only with two or three features on well-known microarray datasets. These models show superior performance to other models in the literature that often have more than 40-100 features in their model construction.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, c-Abl expression is silenced by promoter methylation. In addition, the level of c-Abl needs to be tightly and constantly regulated due to its cytotoxicity and its rapid degradation after activation. Yet the regulation of c-Abl expression remains unclear. In an effort to gain better understanding of c-Abl function, we performed a glutathione S-transferase-Abl pull-down screen and identified TopBP1, a topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein that contains Brca1 C-terminal motifs and has been implicated in DNA damage response. Their physical interaction was verified by in vitro and in vivo assays with TopBP1 found as a substrate of Abl proteins. TopBP1 could repress the expression of c-Abl at both mRNA and protein levels. Reporter assays indicate that TopBP1 directly repressed the promoter activity of c-Abl. Furthermore, TopBP1 repressed expression of c-Abl through a novel mechanism that involved histone deacetylation and DNA methylation. This transcriptional repression was inhibited by c-Abl in a kinase-dependent manner. The dual antagonistic interplay between c-Abl and TopBP1 may also provide a mechanism for fine-tuning of c-Abl levels.","['Zeng, Li', 'Hu, Yuanyu', 'Li, Baojie']","['Zeng L', 'Hu Y', 'Li B']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Proteos, 61 Biopolis Drive, Singapore 138673.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TOPBP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/18 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)56505-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M503016200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Aug 12;280(32):29374-80. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M503016200.

Previously, we have demonstrated that As2O3 can induce p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) expression in A431 cells and then due to cellular cytotoxicity. Presently, we have clarified these signaling events and compared them with EGF. Using reporter assay, RT-PCR and Western blotting, we show that c-Src activation might be a prerequisite for As2O3-induced EGFR/Ras/Raf/ERK signaling. Furthermore, with the aids of 5'-deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that Sp1 binding sites, ranging from -64 to -84 bp, are essential for As2O3- or EGF-regulated p21 expression. Finally, our experiments utilizing cycloheximide prompt the suggestion that the stability of mRNA or protein also contributes to As2O3- or EGF-induced p21 expression. Taken together, we conclude that the Sp1 binding sites are required for As2O3-induced p21 gene transcription through c-Src/EGFR/Ras/Raf/ERK pathway. Furthermore, post-transcriptional or post-translational stabilization mechanism is also essential for As2O3-induced p21 expression.

Some authors have proposed that febrile cancer patients with low risk factors of bacteraemia could be managed at home with domiciliary antibiotic treatment. The objectives are: to determine the incidence of bacteraemia in our cancer patients who have febrile neutropenia; and to identify the low-risk factors so that the patients can be managed at home using domiciliary antibiotic treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical review of paediatric haemato-oncology disease admitted to our hospital in 2002 suffering from febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: We describe a total of 62 episodes of febrile neutropenia in 30 patients; 24 episodes in haematology patients and 38 episodes in oncology patients. High-risk criteria are age <1 year, poor bone-marrow recovery, chemotherapy within 10 days of the episode, rapid fast neutropenia, leukaemia in relapse, uncontrolled solid cancer, and cardiac or nephrology disease. Based on the number of risk-factors, patients with two or less risk-factors have an incidence of bacteraemia of 6.7% (1/16) and patients with three or more risk factors have an incidence of bacteraemia of 32.6% (15/46); p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of bacteraemia is similar to the reviewed literature; probability of bacteraemia increases with the number of individual risk factors, and patients with low risk of bacteraemia could be managed on an outpatient basis using domiciliary antibiotic treatment.","['Gala Peralta, Sandra', 'Cardesa Salzman, Teresa', 'Garcia Garcia, Juan Jose', 'Estella Aguado, Jesus', 'Gene Giralt, Amadeu', 'Luaces Cubells, Carles']","['Gala Peralta S', 'Cardesa Salzman T', 'Garcia Garcia JJ', 'Estella Aguado J', 'Gene Giralt A', 'Luaces Cubells C']","['Seccion de Urgencias, Servicio de Pediatria, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Espana. sgala@hsjbcn.org']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Risk Factors']",2005/06/18 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/06/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['13076200 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02708754 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2005 May;7(4):165-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02708754.,,,,,,,,,,Criterios de riesgo de bacteriemia en el paciente oncologico neutropenico febril pediatrico.,,,,

Seven patients with hairy cell leukemia were diagnosed between January 1990 till December 2003. Diagnosis in all the patients was established by bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsy along with TRAP. In two patients the diagnosis was supplemented by flowcytometry and in another two patients by splenectomy. Six patients were male while one was female. Mean age was 47.7 years (range 36-64). Most common presenting features were pallor and weakness (n=5). All patients had splenomegaly. Blood count at presentation revealed that one patient had bicytopenia, two had isolated thrombocytopenia, and three had pancytopenia. Treatment responses were evaluable in seven patients. Complete response was seen in six patients (85.7%). One patient died after two months due to sepsis while 3 (50%) patients relapsed. Those who relapsed received another course of CDA and have maintained remission with a median duration of response of 48 months (20-48).

This study analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 16 children with DS who developed neoplastic disorders. METHODS: All DS patients aged < 18 years of age with a diagnosis of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from 1990 to 2002 were included in this retrospective study. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients, including age at diagnosis, gender, initial hemogram, cytogenetic findings, immunophenotype, treatment regimen and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 9 patients (56%) had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mainly of the megakaryoblastic subtype. All 8 AML patients who had analyzable metaphase cells revealed clonal chromosomal abnormalities in addition to trisomy 21. Three of these patients developed MDS prior to the onset of AML. Of the 5 patients who underwent chemotherapy, 3 remained in remission with a survival time of 29, 59, and 109 months, and the remaining 2 died as a consequence of chemotherapy toxicity. Among the 6 patients (38%) who developed transient myeloproliferative disorder, 2 were lost to follow-up, 2 died from DS-associated congenital heart abnormalities and 2 survived without any AML changes. The remaining 1 patient (6%) who developed ALL was still in his first remission although this patient suffered profound chemotherapy complications during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that AML is the most common hematologic neoplasm in Taiwanese children with DS, especially megakaryoblastic leukemia. This finding is comparable to the reported results from related studies in different countries. Long-term remission of AML in DS patients can be achieved with appropriate treatment.","['Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Wu, En-Ting', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn']","['Chang HH', 'Lu MY', 'Jou ST', 'Lin KH', 'Tien HF', 'Wu ET', 'Lin DT']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2005 May;104(5):333-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 75 patients with untreated MM (29), relapsed MM (17), smoldering MM (12), and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (17) were studied. The proportion of PCs expressing CD45 was higher among those with early disease (MGUS or smoldering MM) compared to those with advanced disease (new or relapsed MM) (43 vs 22%; P=0.005). Among those with advanced disease, patients with bone lesions had a lower percentage of CD45-positive (CD45+) PCs; 14 vs 34% (P=0.02).

Acute-type ATL cells engrafted in the peripheral blood and in the lymph nodes of recipients at a high efficiency.

These cells infiltrated into recipients' liver, and formed nodular lesions, recapitulating the clinical feature of each patient. In contrast, in smoldering-type ATL cases, multiple clones of ATL cells engrafted efficiently in NOD/SCID/beta2m(null) mice. When smoldering-type ATL cells were retransplanted into secondary NOD/SCID/beta2m(null) recipients, single HTLV-I-infected clones became predominant, suggesting that clones with dominant proliferative activity can be competitively selected in this xenogeneic system.

We have found by real-time RT-PCR that Dlk1 mRNA levels were high in CD34(+) cells in 10 of 12 MDS samples compared with CD34(+) cells from 11 normals. Also, Dlk1 mRNA was elevated in mononuclear, low density bone marrow cells from 11/38 MDS patients, 5/11 AML M6 and 2/4 AML M7 samples. Furthermore, 5/6 erythroleukemia and 2/2 megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines highly expressed Dlk1 mRNA. Levels of Dlk1 mRNA markedly increased during megakaryocytic differentiation of both CMK megakaryoblasts as well as normal CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells. High serum levels of Dlk1 occurred in RA (4/10) and essential thrombocythemia (2/10) patients. Functional studies showed that forced expression of Dlk1 enhanced proliferation of K562 cells growing in 1% fetal bovine serum. Analysis of hematopoiesis of Dlk1 knockout mice suggested that Dlk1 contributed to granulocyte, megakaryocyte and B-cell clonogenic growth and was needed for generation of splenic B-cells. In summary, Dlk1 is overexpressed in selected samples of MDS (especially RA and RAEB) and AML (particularly M6, M7), and it appears to be associated with normal development of megakaryocytes and B cells.","['Sakajiri, S', ""O'kelly, J"", 'Yin, D', 'Miller, C W', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Oshimi, K', 'Shih, L-Y', 'Kim, K-H', 'Sul, H S', 'Jensen, C H', 'Teisner, B', 'Kawamata, N', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Sakajiri S', ""O'kelly J"", 'Yin D', 'Miller CW', 'Hofmann WK', 'Oshimi K', 'Shih LY', 'Kim KH', 'Sul HS', 'Jensen CH', 'Teisner B', 'Kawamata N', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycoproteins/blood/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403832 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403832 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1404-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403832.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1404-1410.']",,,,,

MUM1 expression is seen in various B-cell lymphomas and predicts an unfavorable outcome in some lymphoma subtypes. To elucidate its role in B-cell malignancies, we prepared MUM1-expressing Ba/F3 cells, which proliferated until higher cellular density than the parental cells, and performed cDNA microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression is regulated by MUM1. We found that the expression of four genes including FK506-binding protein 3 (FKBP3), the monokine induced by interferon-gamma(MIG), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule (Faim) and Zinc-finger protein 94 was altered in the MUM1-expressing cells. We then focused on MIG since its expression was immediately upregulated by MUM1. In reporter assays, MUM1 activated the MIG promoter in cooperation with PU.1, and the interaction between MUM1 and the MIG promoter sequence was confirmed. The expression of MIG was correlated with that of MUM1 in B-CLL cell lines, and treatment with neutralizing antibodies against MIG and its receptor, CXCR3, slightly inhibited the proliferation of two MUM1-expressing lines. These results suggest that MUM1 plays roles in the progression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia by regulating the expression of various genes including MIG.

To investigate their prognostic significance, we performed a meta-analysis of the four published studies that provided survival information according to the FLT3 status: ITD, TKD mutation, and wild type. The summary hazard ratios for disease-free survival (DFS) were 1.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58-2.23; P<0.001) for FLT3 mutations, 1.86 (95% CI: 1.52-2.29; P<0.001) for ITD, and 1.90 (95% CI: 1.40-2.60; P<0.001) for TKD mutation. The corresponding ratios for overall survival were 1.61 (95% CI: 1.37-1.89; P<0.001), 1.68 (95% CI: 1.39-2.03; P<0.001), and 1.37 (95% CI: 0.94-2.01; P=0.104). Neither white blood cell count at diagnosis nor cytogenetic risk category was a significant source of heterogeneity. These findings indicate that FLT3 mutations have an adverse effect on the outcome for AML, and that the negative impact of TKD mutation seems comparable to that of ITD with regard to DFS. Although it should be borne in mind that this meta-analysis was based on data abstracted from observational studies, these results may justify the risk-adapted therapeutic strategies for AML according to the FLT3 status.","['Yanada, M', 'Matsuo, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Yanada M', 'Matsuo K', 'Suzuki T', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. myanada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403838 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403838 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1345-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403838.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1345-1349.']",,,,,

Using dynamic in vivo confocal imaging, here we show that murine bone marrow contains unique anatomic regions defined by specialized endothelium. This vasculature expresses the adhesion molecule E-selectin and the chemoattractant stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in discrete, discontinuous areas that influence the homing of a variety of tumour cell lines. Disruption of the interactions between SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 inhibits the homing of Nalm-6 cells (an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line) to these vessels. Further studies revealed that circulating leukaemic cells can engraft around these vessels, suggesting that this molecularly distinct vasculature demarcates a microenvironment for early metastatic tumour spread in bone marrow. Finally, purified haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and lymphocytes also localize to the same microdomains, indicating that this vasculature might also function in benign states to demarcate specific portals for the entry of cells into the marrow space. Specialized vascular structures therefore appear to delineate a microenvironment with unique physiology that can be exploited by circulating malignant cells.","['Sipkins, Dorothy A', 'Wei, Xunbin', 'Wu, Juwell W', 'Runnels, Judith M', 'Cote, Daniel', 'Means, Terry K', 'Luster, Andrew D', 'Scadden, David T', 'Lin, Charles P']","['Sipkins DA', 'Wei X', 'Wu JW', 'Runnels JM', 'Cote D', 'Means TK', 'Luster AD', 'Scadden DT', 'Lin CP']","['Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. dsipkins1@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'E-Selectin/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Confocal/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Skull/cytology']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature03703 [pii]', '10.1038/nature03703 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2005 Jun 16;435(7044):969-73. doi: 10.1038/nature03703.,,"['P50 CA086355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB000664/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY014106/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA071345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2570168,,['NIHMS4383'],,,,,,

Moderate splenic enlargement with red pulp expansion due to lymphocytic infiltration was characteristic of LGL leukemia. Abnormal lymphocytes expressed cytotoxic granule proteins and were consistently CD45RO and CD5 negative in contrast to normal red pulp T cells. This infiltration respected anatomic boundaries with encroachment but no invasion of white pulp areas. Unlike in hairy cell leukemia, the main differential diagnosis for red pulp lymphocytosis, the white pulp was not only preserved in T-cell LGL leukemia but showed germinal center hyperplasia with expansion of the mantle zones. By comparison, T-PLL spleens showed marked red pulp lymphoid infiltration by medium-sized cells with irregular nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. T-PLL lymphocytes, unlike LGLs, were more invasive, infiltrating the spleen capsule as well as white pulp areas. T-cell prolymphocytes did not express cytotoxic granule proteins or NK-cell markers, were CD5+, CD45RO+ like normal spleen T cells, were CD2+, CD3+, CD45+, CD43+, TCRbeta+, but CD25-, CD30-, ALK-1-, TRAP-, DBA44-, and TdT-. Expression of CD4 and CD8 in these cells mirrored that of circulating T-PLL cells. These observations on the morphologic and immunohistochemical appearances of the spleen in T-cell LGL leukemia and T-PLL may aid diagnosis of these uncommon T-cell disorders, particularly T-cell LGL leukemia, where presentation may be cryptic and where unique pathognomonic features, are absent.","['Osuji, Nnenna', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Lampert, Irvin', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew']","['Osuji N', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D', 'Lampert I', 'Wotherspoon A']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital Foundation Trust/Institute of Cancer Research, London UK.

An important clinical observation is that imatinib can affect the function of normal nonmalignant cells resulting in myelosuppression in treated patients. This observation is supported by the recent findings suggesting that imatinib might affect mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells while leaving hematopoietic stem cells unaffected. Furthermore, the induction of a specific T cell response seems to be impaired in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib in contrast to patients receiving interferon-alpha. Recent studies demonstrate that in vitro exposure of mobilized human CD34(+) progenitors to imatinib inhibits their differentiation into dendritic cells. This is of importance as some of the therapeutic effects in the treatment of patients with CML are mediated by the induction of leukemia-specific T cell responses. Studies investigating the effects of imatinib on normal hematopoiesis are of interest because they might help us better understand the side effects observed clinically and might lead to the identification of novel therapeutic applications of the drug (e.g., in Bcr-Abl(-) myeloproliferative disorders and potentially as an immunomodulatory agent).","['Balabanov, Stefan', 'Appel, Silke', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Balabanov S', 'Appel S', 'Kanz L', 'Brossart P', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Klinik fur Onkologie, Hamatologie und KMT, Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Universitats-Klinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",2005/06/17 09:00,2006/11/14 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['1044/1/168 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1349.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Jun;1044:168-77. doi: 10.1196/annals.1349.022.,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the leukemogenic potential of various NUP98-Hox fusion genes alone and with MEIS1. All genes tested had a significant overlapping effect in bone marrow cells in vitro. However, not all formed strong leukemogenic NUP98 fusion genes; but together with overexpression of MEIS1, all induced myeloid leukemia. This phenomenon was also seen with NUP98 fusions containing only the homeodomain of the corresponding Hox protein. We then exploited the strong transforming potential of NUP98-HOXD13 and NUP98-HOXA10 to establish preleukemic myeloid lines composed of early myeloid progenitors with extensive in vitro self-renewal capacity, short-term myeloid repopulating activity, and low propensity for spontaneous leukemic conversion. We also showed that MEIS1 can efficiently induce their conversion to leukemic stem cells, thus providing a novel model for the study of leukemic progression. In contrast to the leukemogenic effect of most of the Hox genes tested, HOXB4 has the ability to increase the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells without disrupting normal differentiation. On the basis of the discovery that the leukemogenic gene HOXA9 can also expand hematopoietic stem cells, we compared the ability of NUP98-Hox fusions to that of HOXB4 to trigger HSC expansion in vitro. Our preliminary results indicate that the expanding potential of HOXB4 is retained and even augmented by fusion to NUP98. Moreover, even greater expansion may be possible using Abd-B-like Hox fusions genes.","['Abramovich, Carolina', 'Pineault, Nicolas', 'Ohta, Hideaki', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Abramovich C', 'Pineault N', 'Ohta H', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2005/06/17 09:00,2006/11/14 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['1044/1/109 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1349.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Jun;1044:109-16. doi: 10.1196/annals.1349.014.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept that only a subpopulation of rare cancer stem cells (CSCs) is responsible for maintenance of the neoplasm emerged nearly 50 years ago; however, conclusive proof for the existence of a CSC was obtained only relatively recently. The evidence for the existence of CSCs was first derived from the study of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), largely because of the availability of quantitative stem cell assays for the leukemic stem cell (LSC). These studies showed that only rare cells within the leukemic clone had the capacity to initiate AML growth after transplant into NOD/SCID mice, establishing the hierarchical organization of AML. Recent clonal-tracking studies showed that the LSC compartment is composed of different classes of LSCs, which can be distinguished on the basis of self-renewal potential. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the leukemogenic process as well as the design of more effective therapies to eliminate AML based on eradication of the LSCs.

We previously reported the identification of a high titer-specific immunoglobulin G response against two novel leukemia-associated antigens, CML28 and CML66, which correlated with immune-induced remission. The present studies characterize expression of CML28 and CML66 in primary hematopoietic tissues. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Specific monoclonal antibodies to CML28 and CML66 were developed and used to detect antigen expression in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia tissue on Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Expression patterns were confirmed by antigen-specific real-time PCR. RESULTS: Both CML28 and CML66 were highly expressed in leukemic blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and CML blast crisis but barely detectable in normal bone marrow, normal peripheral blood, or leukemic cells from patients with stable-phase CML. In contrast, purified CD34+ progenitors from normal individuals and patients with stable-phase CML expressed high levels of CML28 and CML66 transcript and protein. Immunohistochemical staining for CML66 confirmed rare staining of myeloid precursors in normal marrow and diffuse staining of myeloblastic cells in acute myelogenous leukemia and blast crisis CML marrows. CONCLUSIONS: The expression patterns of CML28 and CML66 are strikingly similar and suggest that antigen expression may play a role in shaping the post-DLI antibody repertoire. The CD34+ restricted pattern of expression of CML28 and CML66 is particularly relevant in light of the notion that DLI likely exerts its curative effect by targeting antigens present in self-renewing malignant progenitor populations in CML.","['Wu, Catherine J', 'Biernacki, Melinda', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Rogers, Shelby', 'Chen, Linyun', 'Yang, Xiao-Feng', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ritz, Jerome']","['Wu CJ', 'Biernacki M', 'Kutok JL', 'Rogers S', 'Chen L', 'Yang XF', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

The system was optimized using T-cell responses to autologous CD40-activated B cells (CD40-B) transfected with a cytomegalovirus pp65-encoding expression vector.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients had cytogenetic or molecular evidence of disease, despite treatment with imatinib mesylate for all except one patient, at the beginning of study. Hsp70PCs were purified from the leukopheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and were administered in eight weekly intradermal injections at 50 microg/dose without adjuvant. Clinical responses were assessed by bone marrow analysis before and after vaccinations. An IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay was used to estimate the effect of treatment on natural killer cells and T cells against CML. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated. The manufacturing of Hsp70PCs was successful and the administration was safe for all patients. Minimal or no side effects were reported. Clinical responses were seen in 13 of 20 patients as measured by cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells in metaphases and/or, when possible, the level of Bcr/Abl transcript by PCR. Immunologic responses were observed in 9 of 16 patients analyzed, characterized by an increase in the frequency of CML-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells and IFN-gamma-secreting natural killer cells in the blood.

It has greatest activity against CDK2/cyclin E, CDK7/cyclin H, and CDK9/cyclin T. Seliciclib induces apoptosis from all phases of the cell cycle in tumor cell lines, reduces tumor growth in xenografts in nude mice and is currently in phase II clinical trials. This study investigated the mechanism of cell death in multiple myeloma cells treated with seliciclib. In myeloma cells treated in vitro, seliciclib induced rapid dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation at these sites is crucial for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Inhibition of transcription would be predicted to exert its greatest effect on gene products where both mRNA and protein have short half-lives, resulting in rapid decline of the protein levels. One such gene product is the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1, crucial for the survival of a range of cell types including multiple myeloma. As hypothesized, following the inhibition of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, seliciclib caused rapid Mcl-1 down-regulation, which preceded the induction of apoptosis. The importance of Mcl-1 was confirmed by short interfering RNA, demonstrating that reducing Mcl-1 levels alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis. These results suggest that seliciclib causes myeloma cell death by disrupting the balance between cell survival and apoptosis through the inhibition of transcription and down-regulation of Mcl-1. This study provides the scientific rationale for the clinical development of seliciclib for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['MacCallum, David E', 'Melville, Jean', 'Frame, Sheelagh', 'Watt, Kathryn', 'Anderson, Sian', 'Gianella-Borradori, Athos', 'Lane, David P', 'Green, Simon R']","['MacCallum DE', 'Melville J', 'Frame S', 'Watt K', 'Anderson S', 'Gianella-Borradori A', 'Lane DP', 'Green SR']","['Cyclacel Ltd., Dundee Technopole, James Lindsay Place, Dundee, United Kingdom. dmaccallum@cyclacel.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '53-85-0 (Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Roscovitine', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/12/5399 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0233 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Jun 15;65(12):5399-407. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0233.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports showed that HIPK2 can signal cell death via p53, and independently of p53 by activating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway or mediating CtBP degradation. Here we demonstrate that human HIPK2 is small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1)-modified in vitro and in vivo at lysine residue 25, a SUMO consensus modification motif conserved in human and mouse HIPK family proteins. SUMO modification of HIPK2 altered neither its nuclear body localization nor its recruitment to promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies. However, SUMO-1 modification inhibited HIPK2-induced JNK activation and p53-independent antiproliferative function. HIPK2 with a mutated SUMO acceptor lysine residue was refractory to inhibition of HIPK2-mediated JNK activation by SUMO-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SUMO protease SuPr-1 interacts with HIPK2, and both proteins predominantly colocalize in promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies. SuPr-1 deconjugates SUMO-1 from HIPK2 in vitro and in vivo, which results in modestly increased HIPK2-induced JNK activity.

The leukemia dataset of Golub et al. 1 and the NCI60 dataset of Ross et al. 2 present multiclass classification problems where three tumour types and nine cell lines respectively must be identified. We apply an evolutionary algorithm to identify the near-optimal set of predictive genes that classify the data. We also examine the initial gene selection step whereby the most informative genes are selected from the genes assayed. RESULTS: In the absence of feature selection, classification accuracy on the training data is typically good, but not replicated on the testing data. Gene selection using the RankGene software 3 is shown to significantly improve performance on the testing data. Further, we show that the choice of feature selection criteria can have a significant effect on accuracy. The evolutionary algorithm is shown to perform stably across the space of possible parameter settings - indicating the robustness of the approach. We assess performance using a low variance estimation technique, and present an analysis of the genes most often selected as predictors. CONCLUSION: The computational methods we have developed perform robustly and accurately, and yield results in accord with clinical knowledge: A Z-score analysis of the genes most frequently selected identifies genes known to discriminate AML and Pre-T ALL leukemia. This study also confirms that significantly different sets of genes are found to be most discriminatory as the sample classes are refined.","['Jirapech-Umpai, Thanyaluk', 'Aitken, Stuart']","['Jirapech-Umpai T', 'Aitken S']","['School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9LE, United Kingdom. thanya@eng.cmu.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Software']",2005/06/17 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2004/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-6-148 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-6-148 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Jun 15;6:148. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-6-148.,,,20050615,,,PMC1181625,,,,,,,,

Cepharanthine has also been reported to have numerous pharmacological effects besides the inhibition of P-gp. It has also been found that cepharanthine enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin (ADM) and vincristine (VCR), and enhanced apoptosis induced by ADM and VCR of P-gp negative K562 cells.

To clarify the effects of TEL on megakaryocytic maturation as well as erythroid differentiation, we chose the human leukemia cell line UT-7/GM that differentiates into the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages by treatment with erythropoietin and thrombopoietin, respectively. Upon erythropoietin exposure, overexpressed TEL stimulated hemoglobin synthesis and accumulation of the erythroid differentiation-specific transcripts such as gamma-globin, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase-erythroid, and erythropoietin receptor. Moreover, the glycophorin A(+)/glycoprotein IIb(-) fraction appeared more rapidly in the TEL-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, overexpression of TEL was associated with lower levels of the megakaryocytic maturation-specific glycoprotein IIb and platelet factor 4 transcripts under the treatment with thrombopoietin. Consistently, the glycophorin A(-)/glycoprotein IIb(+) fraction increased more slowly in the TEL-overexpressing cells. Finally, expression of endogenous TEL proteins in UT-7/GM cells was down-regulated following erythropoietin and thrombopoietin exposure. All these data suggest that TEL may decide the fate of human erythrocyte/megakaryocyte common progenitors to differentiate towards the erythroid lineage and against the megakaryocytic lineage.","['Takahashi, Wataru', 'Sasaki, Ko', 'Kvomatsu, Norio', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Takahashi W', 'Sasaki K', 'Kvomatsu N', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, 880 Kitakobayashi, Shimotsuga-gun, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS052 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00052.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2005 Jun;96(6):340-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00052.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel treatment approaches include intrathecal liposomal Ara-C, the development of new cytotoxic compounds, signal transduction inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies for intrathecal or systemic use. Until data from multi-centre randomised trials are available, rationalisation of therapy should be done by stratifying patients to prognostic groups.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not berberine could affect arylamine NAT activity and gene expression (NAT mRNA) and the levels of NAT protein in mouse leukemia cells (L 1210). N-acetylated and non-N-acetylated AF were determined and quantited by using high performance liquid chromatography. NAT mRNA was determined and quantited by using RT-PCR. The levels of NAT protein were examined by western blotting and determined by using flow cytometry. Berberine displayed a dose-dependent inhibition to cytosolic NAT activity and intact mice leukemia cells. Time-course experiments indicated that N-acetylation of AF measured from intact mice leukemia cells were inhibited by berberine for up to 24 h. The NAT1 mRNA and NAT proteins in mouse leukemia cells were also inhibited by berberine. This report is the first demonstration, which showed berberine affect mice leukemia cells NAT activity, gene expression (NAT1 mRNA) and levels of NAT protein.","['Lin, S S', 'Chung, J G', 'Lin, J P', 'Chuang, J Y', 'Chang, W C', 'Wu, J Y', 'Tyan, Y S']","['Lin SS', 'Chung JG', 'Lin JP', 'Chuang JY', 'Chang WC', 'Wu JY', 'Tyan YS']","['Department of Radiological Technology, Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*drug effects', 'Berberine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Berberis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia L1210/prevention & control', 'Mice', '*Phytotherapy', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/06/17 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/06/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0944-7113(05)00033-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2003.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2005 May;12(5):351-8. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2003.11.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fusion product of a murine lymphoma cell and a leukemia virus-neutralizing antibody-producer host plasma cell formed spontaneously and secreting the specific antibody continuously.,1-40,"In the mid-1960s the #620 cell passage line of a murine lymphoma-leukemia was developed at the Section of Clinical Tumor Virology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, TX. The diploid lymphoma cells released a retrovirus and were antigenic in young adult Swiss (YAS) mice. Small lymphoma cell inocula were rejected with immunity acquired against large inocula of lymphoma cells. Tissue sections revealed the ""starry sky"" configurations. In one of the tissue cultures set up from lymphoma #620, a cell line consisting of large round poly- or tetraploid cells arose and was referred to as lymphoma cell line #818. The #818 cells grew in suspension cultures and in the form of large, lethal ascitic tumors in YAS mice. Diploid #620 lymphoma cells stained for retroviral antigens; #818 cells stained both for retroviral antigens and immunoglobulins. Fluids withdrawn from #818 cultures neutralized the leukemia virus in spleen focus assays. Immunoglobulin precipitated from #818 suspension culture fluids strongly and specifically neutralized the leukemia virus. The growth of #620 or #818 cells in YAS mice treated with rabbit anti-lymphoma cell immune sera was strongly inhibited but culture fluids of #818 cells showed weak and insignificant inhibition against leukemia-lymphoma #620 (in one experiment, unpublished). In two experiments #620 lymphoma cells were co-inoculated with immune spleen cells into the peritoneal cavities of YAS mice. The immune spleen cells derived from mice that rejected #620 cell inocula or were actively immunized with a photodynamically inactivated mouse leukemia virus vaccine. In the peritoneal cavities of mice co-inoculated with #620 cells and immune spleen cells, clones of large round cells emerged with tetra- or polyploid chromosomal modes. These cells stained for leukemia viral antigens and immunoglobulins. When passaged in YAS mice these cells induced lethal ascites tumors. It was concluded as early as in 1968-69 that an immune plasma cell can fuse with a lymphoma cell, if the lymphoma cell expresses retroviral antigens against which the plasma cell is producing a specific antibody. Some human lymphoma-leukemia cells express retroviral antigens and/or budding retroviral particles, whether due to the acquisition of new env sequences by incomplete resident endogenous retroviral genomes or due to the entry of exogenous retroviruses into lymphopoietic stem cells. In the Discussion illustrations are provided for the human cell line #778 established from a patient with ""lymphosarcoma cell leukemia"" in 1966. The malignant cells released unidentified retrovirus-like particles and fused with one another and with reactive lymphoid cells of the host. It should be investigated further if human lymphoma-leukemia cells could fuse with an immune plasma cell of the host and thus alter the clinical course of the disease.","['Sinkovics, J G']",['Sinkovics JG'],"[""Cancer Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital.

The mean lumbar puncture opening pressure was significantly higher after intrathecal therapy than before (22 +/- 8 vs. 15 +/- 9 cm H2O, P = 0.02) and higher than reported in age-matched children without leukemia. All CSF chemistries, cell count, and morphology were normal. The overall incidence of complications was 13.7%. Most were mild and resolved quickly, but significant neurologic complications did occur.

Patients were diagnosed between November 1995 and March 1997. All hospital encounters for these patients starting from the time of diagnosis to 3 years from diagnosis were identified using hospital administrative data. The patients were categorized into four diagnostic groups: lymphoid malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma), myeloid leukemias (acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia), central nervous system tumors, and solid tumors. Hospital charges and length of stay for patients in each diagnostic category were described. Predictive models for total resource consumption (total hospital charges) and intensive care use were derived. One hundred sixty-five of the 195 were admitted to Riley Hospital for Children at least once during the 3-year period following diagnosis. Among these 165, mean age at diagnosis was 6.9 years (minimum newborn, maximum 18.7 years). The ratio of boys to girls was 99:66 (1.5:1). The distribution of 165 diagnoses was as follows: 65 (39%) with lymphoid malignancy, 13 (8%) with myeloid leukemia, 36 (22%) with central nervous system tumors, and 51 (31%) with solid tumors. Sixty-two patients (38%) used the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at least once; 22 patients (13%) underwent stem cell transplantation. Sixty-five patients (39%) entered clinical trials. One hundred thirty-nine patients (84%) were alive at the end of 3 years. Three-year cumulative hospital charges were USD 16 million--almost USD 100,000/child hospitalized. Half of these charges were incurred in the first 4.5 months after diagnosis. Half of all hospital charges accrued to only 12.7% of patients; these patients were more likely to have a diagnosis of myeloid leukemia, to have undergone stem cell transplantation, and to have used the PICU. There were three independent predictors of hospital charges (log transformed): stem cell transplantation, PICU utilization, and death within 3 years of diagnosis. PICU utilization was predicted by tumor type (myeloid leukemia and central nervous system tumors were positive predictors of PICU utilization; lymphoid malignancy and solid tumors were negative predictors), stem cell transplantation, and death within 3 years of diagnosis. The authors conclude that hospitalization for childhood cancer is common, costly in the short term, and to some extent predictable. These data suggest that failures of current treatment not only lead to death but also add significantly to hospital resource utilization.","['Rosenman, Marc B', 'Vik, Terry', 'Hui, Siu L', 'Breitfeld, Philip P']","['Rosenman MB', 'Vik T', 'Hui SL', 'Breitfeld PP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospital Departments/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/07/28 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200506000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000168724.19025.a4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Jun;27(6):295-300. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000168724.19025.a4.,,['1T15 LM 07117/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Following exogenous infection and integration into the germ line, copies of these viruses can become fixed within the genome. The resulting endogenous proviral ""fossils"" represent a record of past retroviral infections and forms. Previous work in our laboratory has been directed at dissecting the extensive nonecotropic murine leukemia virus content of the mouse genome. One such provirus, hortulanus endogenous murine leukemia virus (HEMV), found in a single copy in the genome of Mus spicilegus, was remarkable for characteristics that suggested that it was ancient and related to the hypothetical common ancestor of murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) and other gammaretroviral species. In the present study, we have analyzed its functional properties. Transfection of a molecular clone of the HEMV provirus into mouse-derived cell lines revealed that it is replication competent. Furthermore, host range and interference studies revealed a strictly ecotropic host range and the use of a receptor distinct from those used by other classical MLVs. The identity of nucleotide sequence of the long terminal repeats (LTRs) further suggested that HEMV is a relatively recent insertion into the M. spicilegus genome at the distal end of chromosome 7. Although unique to M. spicilegus, its presence in a homozygous state in three individuals obtained from different regions implies that it has been present long enough to become fixed in this species. Exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of all regions of the HEMV genome supported the previously assigned ancestral position of HEMV relative to other MLV-related viruses. Thus, HEMV is a relatively recent introduction into the Mus germ line but is representative of a relatively ancestral MLV group.","['Tipper, Christopher H', 'Bencsics, Craig E', 'Coffin, John M']","['Tipper CH', 'Bencsics CE', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/classification/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Muridae', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/classification/*genetics']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/13/8316 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.13.8316-8329.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jul;79(13):8316-29. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.13.8316-8329.2005.,,"['R01 CA089441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 89441-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1143770,,,,,,,,

In contrast, HIV-1 Vif is unable to block inhibition mediated by APOBEC3 proteins expressed by several heterologous species, including mice. Here, we have asked whether the simple retrovirus murine leukemia virus (MLV) is sensitive to restriction by the cognate murine or heterologous, human APOBEC3 proteins. We demonstrate that MLV is highly sensitive to inhibition by human APOBEC3G and APOBEC3B but resistant to inhibition by murine APOBEC3 or by other human APOBEC3 proteins, including APOBEC3F. This sensitivity fully correlates with the ability of these proteins to be packaged into MLV virion particles: i.e., human APOBEC3G and APOBEC3B are packaged while murine APOBEC3 and human APOBEC3F are excluded. Moreover, this packaging in turn correlates with the differential ability of these APOBEC3 proteins to bind MLV Gag. Together, these data suggest that MLV Gag has evolved to avoid binding, and hence virion packaging, of the cognate murine APOBEC3 protein but that MLV infectivity is still restricted by certain heterologous APOBEC3 proteins that retain this ability. Moreover, these results suggest that APOBEC3 proteins may help prevent the zoonotic infection of humans by simple retroviruses and provide a mechanism for how simple retroviruses can avoid inhibition by APOBEC3 family members.","['Doehle, Brian P', 'Schafer, Alexandra', 'Wiegand, Heather L', 'Bogerd, Hal P', 'Cullen, Bryan R']","['Doehle BP', 'Schafer A', 'Wiegand HL', 'Bogerd HP', 'Cullen BR']","['Duke University Medical Center, Box 3025, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virion/drug effects/*physiology']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/13/8201 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.13.8201-8207.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jul;79(13):8201-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.13.8201-8207.2005.,,"['R01 AI057099/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI065301/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI57099/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI65301/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1143768,,,,,,,,

In agriculturally intensive regions, approximately 30% of dairy cows are BLV infected. Like the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), there is a lengthy period of viral quiescence after initial infection with BLV. Unlike HTLV, BLV resides predominantly in B cells. Lymphoma is observed in less than 10% of BLV-infected adult cattle. Although viremia is undetectable in vivo, BLV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells readily become productive when cultured in vitro. Productivity is markedly diminished when cultures are supplemented with bovine plasma. This inhibitory activity of bovine plasma has been attributed to the ""plasma blocking factor"" (PBF). Here, we describe the purification of a PBF whose activity was resistant to heating to 65 degrees C for 10 min and was attributable to a fibronectin-containing complex of approximately 320 kDa under nonreducing conditions. By use of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (mass spectrometry), a protein with a size of 220 kDa and a pI of 5.4 was identified as a member of the fibronectin group of molecules.

In an effort to localize these linkages, we digested deproteinized RNA from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles with RNase H in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to specific sites in viral RNA. The cleaved RNAs were then characterized by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. We found that fragments composed of nucleotides 1 to 754 were dimeric, with a linkage as thermostable as that between dimers of intact genomic RNA. In contrast, there was no stable linkage between fragments consisting of nucleotides 755 to 8332. Thus, the most stable linkage between monomers is on the 5' side of nucleotide 754. This conclusion is in agreement with earlier electron microscopic analyses of partially denatured viral RNAs and with our study (C. S. Hibbert, J. Mirro, and A. Rein, J. Virol. 78:10927-10938, 2004) of encapsidated nonviral mRNAs containing inserts of viral sequence. We obtained similar results with RNAs from immature MLV particles, in which the dimeric linkage is different from that in mature particles and has not previously been localized. The 5' and 3' fragments of cleaved RNA are all held together by thermolabile linkages, indicating the presence of tethering interactions between bases 5' and bases 3' of the cleavage site.

We studied the role of ICOS on alloreactive T cells in graft versus host disease (GVHD) and determined that ICOS expression was up-regulated on alloreactive T cells in recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with GVHD. We compared ICOS-/- T cells with wild-type (WT) T cells in 2 GVHD models. In both models, recipients of ICOS-/- T cells demonstrated significantly less GVHD morbidity and mortality, which was associated with less intestinal and hepatic GVHD but increased cutaneous GVHD. In addition, recipients of ICOS-/- donor T cells displayed a slight decrease in graft versus leukemia (GVL) activity. Further analysis of alloreactive ICOS-/- T cells showed no defect in activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and target organ infiltration. Recipients of ICOS-/- T cells had decreased serum levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), while interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 levels were increased, suggesting that alloreactive ICOS-/- T cells are skewed toward T helper-2 (Th2) differentiation. These data suggest a novel role for ICOS in the regulation of Th1/Th2 development of activated T cells. In conclusion, alloreactive ICOS-/- donor T cells induce less GVHD due to a Th2 immune deviation while GVL activity is slightly diminished.","['Hubbard, Vanessa M', 'Eng, Jeffrey M', 'Ramirez-Montagut, Teresa', 'Tjoe, Kartono H', 'Muriglan, Stephanie J', 'Kochman, Adam A', 'Terwey, Theis H', 'Willis, Lucy M', 'Schiro, Rafaella', 'Heller, Glen', 'Murphy, George F', 'Liu, Chen', 'Alpdogan, Onder', 'van den Brink, Marcel R M']","['Hubbard VM', 'Eng JM', 'Ramirez-Montagut T', 'Tjoe KH', 'Muriglan SJ', 'Kochman AA', 'Terwey TH', 'Willis LM', 'Schiro R', 'Heller G', 'Murphy GF', 'Liu C', 'Alpdogan O', 'van den Brink MR']","['Department of Medicine and ImmunologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Kettering 406D, Mailbox 111, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Icos protein, mouse)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)68581-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-01-0410 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Nov 1;106(9):3285-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0410.

We assessed the inhibitory concentration 50% for imatinib (IC50imatinib) in 62 patients with de novo chronic-phase CML as a predictor of molecular response. IC50imatinib was determined in pretherapy blood samples by measuring the in vitro imatinib-induced reduction of the phosphorylated form of the adaptor protein Crkl (CT10 regulator of kinase like). There was marked variability between patients, with IC50imatinib ranging from 0.375 to 1.8 microM (median, 0.6 microM). Patients with low IC50imatinib (IC50 < or = 0.6 microM; n = 36) had a 36% probability of achieving 2-log reduction in BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-abelson) by 3 months compared with 8% in patients with high IC50imatinib (n = 26) (P = .01). The IC50imatinib was also predictive of molecular response at 12 months, with 47% of patients in the low IC50imatinib group achieving 3-log reduction and 23% in the high IC50imatinib group (P = .03). The predictive power of IC50imatinib was particularly strong in patients with low Sokal scores. These data provide strong evidence that intrinsic sensitivity to imatinib is variable in previously untreated patients with CML, and the actual level of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition achieved is critical to imatinib response. The IC50imatinib potentially provides a new prognostic indicator for molecular response in patients treated with imatinib.","['White, Deborah', 'Saunders, Verity', 'Lyons, A Bruce', 'Branford, Susan', 'Grigg, Andrew', 'To, L Bik', 'Hughes, Timothy']","['White D', 'Saunders V', 'Lyons AB', 'Branford S', 'Grigg A', 'To LB', 'Hughes T']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) and Hanson Institute, Adelaide, Australia. deb.white@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67248-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-1103 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2520-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1103.

Polyclonal expansion of virus-infected T cells predisposes them to transformation. Constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the leukemic cells is essential for their growth and survival. Blocking NF-kappaB has been shown to be a potential strategy to treat ATL. We tested this approach using a novel NF-kappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), and also examined its application to chemoprevention by selective purging of the HTLV-1-infected cells. DHMEQ inhibited NF-kappaB activation in primary ATL cells and cell lines derived from them and induced apoptotic cell death. NF-kappaB inhibition down-regulated expression of genes involved in antiapoptosis or cell-cycle progression. DHMEQ protected severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice inoculated with HTLV-1-transformed cells from death. In addition, DHMEQ selectively targeted HTLV-1-infected cells in the peripheral blood of virus carriers in vitro, resulting in a decreased number of infected cells. We conclude that NF-kappaB is a potential molecular target for treatment and prevention of ATL. As a potent NF-kappaB inhibitor, DHMEQ is a promising compound allowing the translation of this strategy into clinical medicine.","['Watanabe, Mariko', 'Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Shoda, Momoko', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Aizawa, Shigemi', 'Maruyama-Nagai, Masae', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Koga, Shin', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Kikuchi, Hiroshi', 'Uozumi, Kimiharu', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Higashihara, Masaaki', 'Umezawa, Kazuo', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Horie, Ryouichi']","['Watanabe M', 'Ohsugi T', 'Shoda M', 'Ishida T', 'Aizawa S', 'Maruyama-Nagai M', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Koga S', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Okayama A', 'Kikuchi H', 'Uozumi K', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Higashihara M', 'Umezawa K', 'Watanabe T', 'Horie R']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*prevention & control/virology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Weight', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proviruses', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67241-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3646 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2462-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3646.

Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve prognosis. Recently, we showed that FLT3 is highly expressed in MLL rearranged ALL (MLL). Here we demonstrate FLT3 expression in infants with MLL (n = 41) to be significantly higher compared to both infant (n = 8; P < .001) and noninfant patients with ALL (n = 23; P = .001) carrying germline MLL genes. Furthermore, leukemic cells from infants with MLL were significantly more sensitive to the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor PKC412 (N-benzoyl staurosporine) than noninfant ALL cells, and at least as sensitive as internal tandem duplication-positive (ITD+) AML cells. Surprisingly, activation loop mutations only occurred in about 3% (1 of 36) of the cases and no FLT3/ITDs were observed. However, measuring FLT3 phosphorylation in infants with MLL expressing varying levels of wild-type FLT3 revealed that high-level FLT3 expression is associated with ligand-independent FLT3 activation. This suggests that infant MLL cells displaying activated FLT3 as a result of overexpression can be targeted by FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412. However, at concentrations of PKC412 minimally required to fully inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation, the cytotoxic effects were only fractional. Thus, PKC412-induced apoptosis in infant MLL cells is unlikely to be a consequence of FLT3 inhibition alone but may involve inhibition of multiple other kinases by this drug.","['Stam, Ronald W', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'Nollau, Peter', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'van der Voort, Ella', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'de Lorenzo, Paola', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Stam RW', 'den Boer ML', 'Schneider P', 'Nollau P', 'Horstmann M', 'Beverloo HB', 'van der Voort E', 'Valsecchi MG', 'de Lorenzo P', 'Sallan SE', 'Armstrong SA', 'Pieters R']","[""Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ligands', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67243-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3667 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 1;106(7):2484-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3667.

In the present study, the activity of sapphyrins as anticancer agents in hematopoietic-derived tumor cells was explored. It was found that a dihydroxylated water-soluble sapphyrin derivative (PCI-2000) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in a wide variety of tumor cell lines including lymphoma (Ramos, DHL-4, and HF-1), leukemia (Jurkat and HL-60), and myeloma (8226/S, 1-310, C2E3, and 1-414). PCI-2000 triggers an apoptotic pathway in these tumor cells as shown by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; activation of caspases 9, 8, and 3; cleavage of the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and Annexin V binding. Apoptosis can be partially inhibited by overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 or treatment with benzyloxycarbonyl-valine-alanine-aspartic acid-fluoromethylketone, a cell-permeable caspase inhibitor. Both PCI-2000 and PCI-2010, a tetrahydroxy bis-carbamate derivative of PCI-2000, result in increased levels of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation resulted in a synergistic increase of PCI-2000 cytotoxicity. PCI-2010 showed less toxicity in mice than PCI-2000 and was active in slowing the growth of Ramos and HL-60 tumor xenografts in nude mice.

METHODS: HL60 cells were exposed to clinically achievable concentrations of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active metabolite of CPT-11, and blood sampled from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia in myeloid blast transformation treated with CPT-11. Gene expression changes were studied by cDNA microarray and correlated with biological responses by studying DNA distributions by flow cytometry. RESULTS: cDNA microarray analysis showed down-regulation and up-regulation of specific cell cycle-associated genes, consistent with loss of S-phase cells and temporary delay of G(1)-S-phase transition seen by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry showed that cells in S phase during SN-38 exposure underwent apoptosis, whereas cells in G(2)-M and G(1) were delayed in G(1) and entered S phase only 6 to 8 hours after drug removal, consistent with the observed changes in gene expression. Proapoptotic changes in gene transcription included down-regulation of antiapoptotic genes and up-regulation of proapoptotic genes. Many gene expression changes observed following in vitro SN-38 exposure were also seen following in vivo administration of 10 or 15 mg/m(2) CPT-11; notably, proapoptotic changes included reduced transcription of survivin pathway-associated genes and increased transcription of death receptor 5. CONCLUSION: CPT-11-induced changes in gene expression profiles in vitro and in vivo are consistent with temporary delay in G(1)-S transition and enhanced responsiveness to apoptosis, both of which may contribute to the synergistic interactions of this drug with antimetabolites.","['Minderman, Hans', 'Conroy, Jeffrey M', ""O'Loughlin, Kieran L"", 'McQuaid, Devin', 'Quinn, Paul', 'Li, Song', 'Pendyala, Lakshmi', 'Nowak, Norma J', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Minderman H', 'Conroy JM', ""O'Loughlin KL"", 'McQuaid D', 'Quinn P', 'Li S', 'Pendyala L', 'Nowak NJ', 'Baer MR']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. hans.minderman@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/6/885 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0048 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Jun;4(6):885-900. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0048.,,"['P30 CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA89938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to analyze the prognosis and treatment outcome of elderly AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 205 AML patients aged 65 years or older at our hospital. Prior to study initiation, we designated 13 variables to be analyzed for their impact on complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Induction regimen (standard chemotherapy) and good performance status (PS) (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0-1) independently influenced the achievement of CR. Multivariate analysis also determined five poor prognostic factors for OS: poor PS (score 2-4), presence of comorbidities, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (> or =2x upper normal limit), extreme leukocytosis (> or =100 x 10(9)/l) and marked thrombocytopenia (< or =20 x 10(9)/l). Age was not an independent contributing factor in terms of either CR attainment or OS duration. Low-risk patients, who possessed one or less non-leukocytosis poor prognostic factor, had significantly longer disease-free survival and OS than their high-risk counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly AML patients should be risk-stratified at diagnosis. Anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy would be the best therapeutic option for such patients.","['Chen, C-C', 'Yang, C-F', 'Yang, M-H', 'Lee, K-D', 'Kwang, W-K', 'You, J-Y', 'Yu, Y-B', 'Ho, C-H', 'Tzeng, C-H', 'Chau, W-K', 'Hsu, H-C', 'Gau, J-P']","['Chen CC', 'Yang CF', 'Yang MH', 'Lee KD', 'Kwang WK', 'You JY', 'Yu YB', 'Ho CH', 'Tzeng CH', 'Chau WK', 'Hsu HC', 'Gau JP']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)54953-5 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdi259 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2005 Aug;16(8):1366-73. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdi259.

Monkey ear skin fibroblasts (MESFs), monkey oviductal fibroblasts (MOFs), monkey follicular granulosa fibroblast-like (MFG) cells, monkey follicular granulosa epithelium-like (MFGE) cells, and clonally derived fibroblasts from MESF (CMESFs) were established and compared with the ability of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to support rESC growth. MESF, MOF, MFG, and CMESF cells, but not MFGE cells, were as good as or better than MEFs in supporting undifferentiated growth while maintaining the differentiation potential of the rESCs. In an effort to understand the unique properties of supportive feeder cells, expression levels for a number of candidate genes were examined. MOF, MESF, and MEF cells highly expressed leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, stem cell factor, transforming growth factor beta1, bone morphogenetic protein 4, and WNT3A, whereas WNT2, WNT4, and WNT5A were downregulated, compared with MFGE cells. Additionally, all monkey feeder cell lines expressed Dkk1 and LRP6, antagonists of the WNT signaling pathway, but not WNT1, WNT8B, or Dkk2. rESCs grown on homologous feeders maintained normal karyotypes, displayed the characteristics of ESCs, including morphology, alkaline phosphatase, Oct4, the cell surface markers stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3, SSEA-4, tumor-related antigen (TRA)-1-60, and TRA-1-81, and formed cystic embryoid bodies in vitro that included differentiated cells representing the three major germ layers.

Glutamate residue 426 in ECL6 was identified as critical for binding. However, binding to ECL6 was not sufficient for HTLV envelope-driven infection. Infection required two additional determinants located in ECL1 and ECL5, which otherwise did not influence HTLV envelope binding. Moreover the single N-glycosylation chain located in ECL1 was not required for HTLV infection.

Nuclear accumulation of the enzyme correlates inversely with cellular glycogen content. Although the glucose-induced export of MGS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is blocked by leptomycin B, and therefore mediated by CRM1, no nuclear export signal was identified in the sequence of the protein. Deletion analysis shows that the region comprising amino acids 555-633 of human MGS, which encompasses an Arg-rich cluster involved in the allosteric activation of the enzyme by Glc6P, is crucial for its nuclear concentration and aggregation. Mutation of these Arg residues, which desensitizes the enzyme towards Glc6P, interferes with its nuclear accumulation. In contrast, the known phosphorylation sites of MGS that regulate its activity are not involved in the control of its subcellular distribution. Nuclear human MGS co-localizes with the promyelocytic leukaemia oncoprotein and p80-coilin, a marker of Cajal bodies. The subnuclear distribution of MGS is altered by incubation with transcription inhibitors.

The PiT family members are conserved throughout all kingdoms and use either sodium (Na+) or proton (H+) gradients to transport P(i). Sequence logo analyses revealed that independent of their cation dependency these proteins harbor conserved signature sequences in their N- and C-terminal ends with the common core consensus sequence GANDVANA. With the exception of 10 proteins from extremophiles all 109 proteins analyzed carry an aspartic acid in one or both of the signature sequences. We changed either of the highly conserved aspartates, Asp28 and Asp506, in the N- and C-terminal signature sequences, respectively, of human PiT2 to asparagine and analyzed P(i) uptake function in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Both mutant proteins were expressed at the cell surface of the oocytes but exhibited knocked out NaP(i) transport function. Human PiT2 is also a retroviral receptor and we have previously shown that this function can be exploited as a control for proper processing and folding of mutant proteins. Both mutant transporters displayed wild-type receptor functions implying that their overall architecture is undisturbed. Thus the presence of an aspartic acid in either of the PiT family signature sequences is critical for the Na+-dependent P(i) transport function of human PiT2. The conservation of the aspartates among proteins using either Na+- or H+-gradients for P(i) transport suggests that they are involved in H+-dependent P(i) transport as well. Current results favor a membrane topology model in which the N- and C-terminal PiT family signature sequences are positioned in intra- and extracellular loops, respectively, suggesting that they are involved in related functions on either side of the membrane. The present data are in agreement with a possible role of the signature sequences in translocation of cations.","['Bottger, Pernille', 'Pedersen, Lene']","['Bottger P', 'Pedersen L']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 ((methyl)ammonium uptake carrier, Corynebacterium)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SLC20A2 protein, human)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Asparagine/genetics', 'Aspartic Acid/*genetics', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells/virology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Mutation', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', 'Symporters/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/06/16 09:00,2005/08/11 09:00,['2005/06/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJB4720 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04720.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2005 Jun;272(12):3060-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04720.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 21-year retrospective survey of feline lymphoma covering the period 1983-2003 was conducted with the patient database at the Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital (VMTH) at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. This period comprises the post-feline leukemia virus (FeLV) era. Feline lymphoma historically has been highly associated with retrovirus infection. Mass testing and elimination and quarantine programs beginning in the 1970s and vaccination programs in the 1980s dramatically reduced the subsequent FeLV infection rate among pet cats. The results of this survey confirm a significant decrease in the importance of FeLV-associated types of lymphoma in cats. In spite of this decrease in FeLV infection, the incidence of lymphoma in cats treated at the VMTH actually increased from 1982 to 2003.

Recent studies have elucidated a novel intracellular signaling pathway used by RhoA to elicit activation of serum response factor (SRF)-mediated transcription. In this pathway, activation of RhoA triggers nuclear translocation of the SRF co-activator, megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL). In assessing whether RhoA regulates transcription in neurons via this pathway, we have found that a constitutively active form of Tech (transcript-enriched in cortex and hippocampus), a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is expressed in forebrain neurons, stimulates SRF reporter activity in extracts of primary cortical cultures and induces nuclear translocation of MAL in cortical neurons. Both of these responses appear to be mediated by Tech's activation of RhoA as they are not mimicked by a mutant Tech construct lacking RhoA GEF activity and are blocked by C3 transferase, a selective inhibitor of RhoA. Furthermore, Tech-induced increases in SRF activity are suppressed by a dominant negative MAL construct. These findings demonstrate that RhoA signaling pathways are able to regulate transcription in neurons by triggering translocation of the SRF co-activator MAL.","['Tabuchi, Akiko', 'Estevez, Marcel', 'Henderson, Jennifer A', 'Marx, Ruth', 'Shiota, Jun', 'Nakano, Hiroyasu', 'Baraban, Jay M']","['Tabuchi A', 'Estevez M', 'Henderson JA', 'Marx R', 'Shiota J', 'Nakano H', 'Baraban JM']","['Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RBM15 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*physiology']",2005/06/15 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/06/15 09:00'],"['2005/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC3179 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03179.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2005 Jul;94(1):169-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03179.x.,,['DA0266/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant asparaginase (ASP) and steroid therapy has been shown to increase the incidence of TE. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)-ALL protocols use a combination of ASP and steroids during the postinduction intensification phase when high-risk (HR) patients receive thrice the steroid-dose given to standard-risk (SR) patients. We studied prospectively assembled cohorts of children treated on two consecutive DFCI-ALL protocols to define the risk factors for symptomatic TE. Ten (11%) of 91 patients developed symptomatic TE; eight (seven HR) during intensification. Seven (44%) of 16 older patients (>/=10 years) compared with three of 75 (4%) younger patients developed TE (P < 0.0001). Nine of 35 (26%) HR and one of 56 (2%) SR patients developed TE (P = 0.0006). Gender, ALL-immunophenotype, steroid-type or ASP dosing schedule did not alter the risk but older age and HR-disease were factors predisposing to TE associated with DFCI-ALL protocols.

LISA significantly reduced the number of erroneous prescriptions (zero of 144 with LISA vs. 54 of 144 without; P < 0.0001) without affecting the number of times subjects deliberately overrode the protocol (seven of 144 times using LISA and six of 144 without). Using LISA reduced the time taken by novices to reach a decision for each case but increased the time taken by experts. Thirty-five of 36 subjects said they would be likely to use the system if it were available. A system like LISA is likely to be acceptable to clinicians, and has the potential to increase protocol compliance and decrease prescribing errors while allowing clinicians to override the protocol in specific cases where sound reasons exist for doing so.","['Bury, Jonathan', 'Hurt, Chris', 'Roy, Anindita', 'Cheesman, Louise', 'Bradburn, Mike', 'Cross, Simon', 'Fox, John', 'Saha, Vaskar']","['Bury J', 'Hurt C', 'Roy A', 'Cheesman L', 'Bradburn M', 'Cross S', 'Fox J', 'Saha V']","['Academic Unit of Pathology, Division of Genomic Medicine, University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, UK. j.p.bury@sheffield.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods/standards', 'Cross-Over Studies', '*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', '*Internet', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2005/06/15 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/06/15 09:00'],"['2005/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5541 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05541.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Jun;129(6):746-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05541.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prednisolone is the most commonly used steroid, particularly in the maintenance phase of therapy. There is increasing evidence that, even in equipotent dosage for glucocorticoid effect, dexamethasone has enhanced lymphoblast cytotoxicity and penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) compared with prednisolone. Substitution of dexamethasone for prednisolone in the treatment of ALL might, therefore, result in improved event-free and overall survival. Children with newly diagnosed ALL were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone or prednisolone in the induction, consolidation (all received dexamethasone in intensification) and continuation phases of treatment. Among 1603 eligible randomized patients, those receiving dexamethasone had half the risk of isolated CNS relapse (P = 0.0007). Event-free survival was significantly improved with dexamethasone (84.2% vs. 75.6% at 5 years; P = 0.01), with no evidence of differing effects in any subgroup of patients. The use of 6.5 mg/m(2) dexamethasone throughout treatment for ALL led to a significant decrease in the risk of relapse for all risk-groups of patients and, despite the increased toxicity, should now be regarded as part of standard therapy for childhood ALL.","['Mitchell, C D', 'Richards, S M', 'Kinsey, S E', 'Lilleyman, J', 'Vora, A', 'Eden, T O B']","['Mitchell CD', 'Richards SM', 'Kinsey SE', 'Lilleyman J', 'Vora A', 'Eden TO']","['Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. chris.mitchell@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/15 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/06/15 09:00'],"['2005/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5509 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05509.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Jun;129(6):734-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05509.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Medical Research Council Childhood Leukaemia Working Party'],,

Because children with Down syndrome (DS) experience a 20-fold higher risk of leukemia than the general population, the authors evaluated whether periconceptional vitamin supplementation reduced the risk of leukemia in children with DS. METHODS: From 1997 to 2002, 158 children ages birth-18 years with DS and acute leukemia (n = 61 children with acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and n = 97 children with ALL) were enrolled through the Children's Oncology Group in North America. Children with DS alone (n = 173) were identified through the cases' pediatric clinics and frequency matched to cases on age. Mothers of cases and controls completed a telephone interview that included questions regarding vitamin supplement use in the periconceptional period and after knowledge of pregnancy. RESULTS: A decreased risk of leukemia was observed with vitamin supplementation in the periconceptional period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.39-1.00). When stratified by leukemia type, the reduced risk was observed for ALL (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.89), but not for AML (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.48-1.76). Compared with vitamin use in the periconceptional period, use only after knowledge of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of leukemia (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.00-2.58). This was observed for both ALL and AML. CONCLUSIONS: These data added to a growing body of evidence that suggests that periconceptional vitamin use may be protective in the development of certain childhood cancers.","['Ross, Julie A', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Olshan, Andrew F', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Roesler, Michelle']","['Ross JA', 'Blair CK', 'Olshan AF', 'Robison LL', 'Smith FO', 'Heerema NA', 'Roesler M']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. ross@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Vitamins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Preconception Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk', 'Vitamins/*therapeutic use']",2005/06/14 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21171 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jul 15;104(2):405-10. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21171.,,"['R01 CA075169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA75169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although socioeconomic status (SES) has been related to leukemia in some studies, this apparent association may be attributable to ascertainment or participation bias. This study was undertaken to determine whether there is a difference in incidence of childhood leukemia for different levels of SES, as measured by neighborhood income, in an unselected population case group. METHODS: All cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed in the years 1985-2001 were identified from population-based cancer registries in Canada. Postal codes for the place of residence at diagnosis were used to ascertain the census neighborhoods for cases. We constructed neighborhood-based income quintiles from census population data, and stratified the population at risk by sex and 5-year age groupings. Age-standardized incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. We used Poisson regression to compare incidence rate ratios (RRs) across income quintiles. RESULTS: A slightly lower relative risk of childhood leukemia was observed in the poorest quintile compared with the richest (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.80-0.95). The lower risk in the poorest quintile was restricted to acute lymphoid leukemia (0.86; 0.78-0.95) and was strengthened slightly by restriction to urban areas (0.83; 0.74-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that high SES is a true risk factor for childhood leukemia and that inconsistent results from other studies may be related to differences in case ascertainment or study participation.","['Borugian, Marilyn J', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Mezei, Gabor', 'Wilkins, Russell', 'Abanto, Zenaida', 'McBride, Mary L']","['Borugian MJ', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Mezei G', 'Wilkins R', 'Abanto Z', 'McBride ML']","['Cancer Control Research Program, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada. mborugian@bccrc.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Income/classification', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/economics/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Health/statistics & numerical data', '*Social Class', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Urban Health/statistics & numerical data']",2005/06/14 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001648-200507000-00015 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ede.0000164813.46859.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2005 Jul;16(4):526-31. doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000164813.46859.63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical value of ESR, CRP and LDH evaluation in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of treatment among children suffering from cancer. 100 children patients with acute leukaemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nephroblastoma and soft tissue sarcoma were included in the study, being compared to 30 healthy children of the control group. In oncological patients all the markers were estimated prospectively at 5 stages or the disease, i.e.: before treatment, during treatment -- in partial remission (PR) and after complete clinical remission was achieved (CR), after therapy and during the relapse or progression of cancer (PROG). The mean pre-treatment levels of analysed markers in cancer patients were significantly higher than in healthy children (p<0.001). The elevation of ESR, CRP and LDH was observed in 78.7, 50.8 and 72.1% of cases respectively. Good clinical response to antitumour therapy was paralleled with the significant decrease of pre-treatment ESR, CRP and LDH levels, but the values observed in CR, both while treatment and after therapy, did not return towards normal range. The progression of disease was accompanied by the increase of ESR, CRP and LDH levels, however only ESR and CRP values differed significantly in PROG as compared to the CR phase. Among analysed markers, only LDH level at diagnosis proved to be an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival rate. Three-year overall survival rate for patients with pre-treatment LDH level <1.5 x normal value (N) was 94% while for those with LDH >1.5 x N -- 67%. It has been demonstrated that ESR, CRP and LDH determinations in children suffering from cancer may serve as useful markers both in diagnostics and monitoring of the disease course. Moreover, the pre-treatment LDH level appeared to have an important role in prognosis of the overall survival rate.","['Bien, Ewa', 'Balcerska, Anna']","['Bien E', 'Balcerska A']","['Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii, Onkologii i Endokrynologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

The treatment with corticosteroids, methotrexate and irradiation may all cause reduction in bone mass. We assessed bone mineral density (BMD) and several parameters involved in bone formation in long-term survivors with a malignancy at completion of therapy. Total body and lumbar spine bone mineral densities (gram per cm2) were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in 40 patients (age 12-27 yr; median 17.5 yr; 21 with acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 19 with other malignancies) from 3 to 13.9 years (median 7 yr) after discontinuation of therapy. These results were compared with those from 473 healthy controls and expressed as a percentage of the age and sex-matched control values (mean and standard deviation). Serum levels of osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D, urinary concentrations of deoxypyridinoline were determined as well as several specific markers of bone turnover. RESULTS: The total BMD and in the lumbar spine were not significantly reduced in survivors of childhood malignancies compared to the control population. No correlation was found between the BMD values and the cumulative doses and time of corticosteroids, administered Mtx, irradiation, duration of treatment, age at diagnosis. Duration of follow-up showed correlation with lumbar spine BMD. Serum markers of bone formation and resorption were in the normal range (expressed as standard deviation score relative to the age and sex-matched healthy population), bone turnover was not disturbed at the time of the study.

METHODS: In the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study, a case-control study with incident cases and matched birth certificate controls, detailed written vaccination records were collected. A total of 323 cases aged 0-14 years at diagnosis and 409 controls were included in this analysis. All vaccinations were censored on the reference date (date of diagnosis for cases and the corresponding date for matched controls). Conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted, adjusting for potential confounding factors. A primary variable of interest is the number of administrations (doses) of various types of vaccines. RESULTS: Vaccinations against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and rubella were not associated with the risk of leukaemia. The odds ratio for each dose of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.96). Compared with children who received two or fewer doses of Hib vaccine, those who received three or more doses had a significantly reduced risk of childhood leukaemia (odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.94). The number of doses of hepatitis B vaccine received was not associated with leukaemia risk. CONCLUSIONS: Hib vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of childhood leukaemia. Future studies with detailed exposure assessment and large sample sizes are needed to further address the role of vaccinations in the etiology of childhood leukaemia.","['Ma, Xiaomei', 'Does, Monique B', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Russo, Carolyn', 'Wong, Alan', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Ma X', 'Does MB', 'Metayer C', 'Russo C', 'Wong A', 'Buffler PA']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8034, USA. xiaomei.ma@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxoid)', '0 (Haemophilus Vaccines)', '0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)', '0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Pertussis Vaccine)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)', '0 (Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria Toxoid/adverse effects/immunology', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Haemophilus Vaccines/adverse effects/immunology', 'Haemophilus influenzae type b/immunology', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/adverse effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*etiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine/adverse effects/immunology', 'Pertussis Vaccine/adverse effects/immunology', 'Poliomyelitis/immunology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Tetanus Toxoid/adverse effects/immunology', 'Vaccines/*adverse effects/immunology']",2005/06/14 09:00,2006/07/18 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyi113 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyi113 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2005 Oct;34(5):1100-9. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyi113.

Randomized studies comparing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) against standard chemotherapy have produced conflicting results. Dose-dense chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support seems to hold promise. The purpose of this multicenter, randomized trial was to compare failure-free and overall survival in patients with poor prognosis DLCL treated with high-dose sequential (HDS) chemotherapy followed by ASCT or an outpatient dose-dense chemotherapy regimen (MegaCEOP). DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2001, 130 DLCL patients, aged < or = 60 years, with intermediate-high or high-risk disease, according to the International Prognostic Index score, and/or bone marrow involvement were enrolled. Sixty were randomized to HDS chemotherapy plus high-dose mitoxantrone and melphalan with ASCT (arm A) and 66 to the MegaCEOP regimen (6-8 courses of an escalated dose of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin plus vincristine and prednisone with G-CSF every 2-weeks) (arm B); 4 patients were considered ineligible. RESULTS: The complete remission rate was 59% in arm A and 70% in arm B (p = 0.18). After a median follow-up of 78 months, the 6-year failure-free survival was 45% in arm A and 48% in arm B (hazard ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence intervals = 0.72-1.84, p = 0.56). The 5-year overall survival was 49% in arm A and 63% in arm B (hazard ratio = 1.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.98-2.85, p = 0.06). Two cases of secondary acute myeloid leukemia were observed after treatment in group A. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: HDS and ASCT as initial therapy for patients with poor-prognosis DLCL does not provide a benefit over that of outpatient dose-dense MegaCEOP chemotherapy.","['Vitolo, Umberto', 'Liberati, Anna Marina', 'Cabras, Maria Giuseppina', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Baldini, Luca', 'Boccomini, Carola', 'Brugiatelli, Maura', 'Calvi, Roberta', 'Ciccone, Giovannino', 'Genua, Angelo', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Parvis, Guido', 'Pavone, Enzo', 'Salvi, Flavia', 'Sborgia, Marco', 'Gallo, Eugenio']","['Vitolo U', 'Liberati AM', 'Cabras MG', 'Federico M', 'Angelucci E', 'Baldini L', 'Boccomini C', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Calvi R', 'Ciccone G', 'Genua A', 'Deliliers GL', 'Levis A', 'Parvis G', 'Pavone E', 'Salvi F', 'Sborgia M', 'Gallo E']","['Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

The anti-leukemic activity of NK cells against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts has been described, but very few data are available for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). The present study was designed to investigate whether: (i) NK effectors could be expanded from adult and pediatric ALL patients in complete remission; (ii) the signal transduction machinery of these cells was preserved; (iii) NK cells showed cytotoxic activity against autologous blasts; (iv) interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12 and IL-15 were able to increase lytic activity in our in vitro model; (v) any differences in cytotoxic activity could be found between expanded effectors from adult and pediatric patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We co-cultured patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the feeder cell line RPMI 8866 and analyzed the NK cells' expansion capacity by cell count and cytofluorimetric analyses. Signal transduction of expanded effector cells was evaluated by Western blot. 51Cr release assays, before and after stimulation with activating cytokines, were performed to analyze the cytotoxic potential of effector cells against tumor cell lines and autologous blast cells. Data were analyzed with t-tests for paired data. RESULTS: We obtained an average 40-fold increase in NK cells. Signal transduction through the CD16 receptor was preserved. Patients' expanded cells showed cytotoxic activity against target cell lines comparable to that of normal donors. More significantly, these cells also exerted a lytic effect against autologous blasts. In addition, incubating these effectors for 24 hours with IL-2 + IL-15 significantly increased this cytotoxic function. No differences in expansion and cytotoxic activity were found between pediatric and adult patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings document for the first time the possibility of expanding ex vivo cytotoxic effectors with autologous killing capacity from ALL patients in remission, and suggest a new potential immunotherapeutic strategy for the management of early disease recurrence or of residual disease.","['Torelli, Giovanni F', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Maggio, Roberta', 'Alfieri, Cecilia', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Foa, Robin']","['Torelli GF', 'Guarini A', 'Maggio R', 'Alfieri C', 'Vitale A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University of Rome La Sapienza, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. giovanni.torelli@uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/06/14 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Jun;90(6):785-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far 36 leukemia cell lines carrying the 11q23 translocation and MLL rearrangements, including two cell lines with t(6;11)(q27;q23) and an MLL-AF6 fusion gene have been described. We have established a new monocytic cell line with t(6;11), designated SHI-1, and herein describe its biological characteristics. DESIGN AND METHODS: Mononuclear cells isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5b) at relapse were inoculated and passaged by liquid culture. The biological features of the cell line were characterized by morphological assays, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), direct sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), clonogenic culture, quantitative fluorescent PCR, zymography, short tandem repeating sequences-PCR (STR-PCR), multiplex-FISH (M-FISH), and tumorigenic capacity in nude mice. RESULTS: The SHI-1 cell line has been maintained in continuous culture without any external cytokines for three years. The morphology and immunoprofile of the cells show typical features of monocytic lineage. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation accompanied by a deletion of 17p, which are the same abnormalities as were seen in the leukemia cells of this patient in relapse. The MLL-AF6 fusion transcript and the loss of one p53 allele were proven by chromosome painting, FISH and RT-PCR analysis in both SHI-1 cells and the primary leukemia cells. A point mutation of ATC-->ACC at codon 195 of exon 6 in another p53 allele was found by direct sequencing of DNA in SHI-1 cells as well as in the primary leukemia cells. Neither Epstein-Barr virus nor mycoplasma was detected in SHI-1 cells. Tumor masses were found in all sixteen mice 9-19 days after subcutaneous injection of SHI-1 cells. DNA fingerprinting confirmed the authenticity of the cell line. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: SHI-1 is a new monocytic leukemia cell line with the t(6;11) translocation, p53 gene alterations, and high tumorigenicity in nude mice. It could be a valuable tool in the study of leukemogenesis.","['Chen, Suning', 'Xue, Yongquan', 'Zhang, Xueguang', 'Wu, Yafang', 'Pan, Jinlan', 'Wang, Yong', 'Ceng, Jiannong']","['Chen S', 'Xue Y', 'Zhang X', 'Wu Y', 'Pan J', 'Wang Y', 'Ceng J']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Point Mutation', 'Recurrence', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/06/14 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Jun;90(6):766-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This aim was achieved using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay that allows the detection of NUP98 aberrations independently of the partner gene involved. DESIGN AND METHODS: Screening of 59 consecutive patients enrolled in the Austrian AML-BFM93 clinical trial was performed by dual-color FISH. In addition, 14 selected cases with various hematologic malignancies and 11p13-15 aberrations were analyzed. NUP98-positive cases were further investigated by fusion gene-specific FISH and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Among the 59 AML patients, one NUP98-NSD1 positive case (1.7%) was detected. Among the 14 selected patients, five new NUP98 positive cases were determined. Two cases showed an inv(11)(p15q22)/NUP98-DDX10 fusion, one each displayed a t(5;11)(q35;p15)/NUP98-NSD1 and a t(11;20)(p15;q12)/NUP98-TOP1 fusion, and one case with a putative new fusion partner gene at 3p24 was identified. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The observed frequency of 1.7% confirmed the low incidence of NUP98 rearrangements in childhood AML. The low occurrence of NUP98 rearrangements in selected samples with 11p13-15 alterations suggests the existence of variable chromosomal breakpoints and affected genes in this region. The identification of a new NUP98 fusion partner region confirms the evident promiscuity of NUP98. Thus, analysis of NUP98 aberrations by FISH seems to be the method of choice for determining the presence of these genetic lesions in unselected patients, and to confirm the involvement of NUP98 in cases with 11p15 aberrations.","['Nebral, Karin', 'Konig, Margit', 'Schmidt, Helmut H', 'Lutz, Dieter', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Brugger, Stefan', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Nebral K', 'Konig M', 'Schmidt HH', 'Lutz D', 'Sperr WR', 'Kalwak K', 'Brugger S', 'Dworzak MN', 'Haas OA', 'Strehl S']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/06/14 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Jun;90(6):746-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-asparaginase from Erwinia carotovora NCYC 1526 (ErA) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a two-step procedure comprising cation-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on immobilised L-asparagine. The enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme were investigated and the kinetic parameters (K(m), k(cat)) for a number of substrates were determined. Molecular modelling studies were also employed to create a model of ErA, based on the known structure of the Erwinia chrysanthemi enzyme. The molecular model was used to help interpret biochemical data concerning substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The kinetic parameters of selected substrates were determined at various pH values, and the pH-dependence profiles of V(max) and V(max)/K(m) were analyzed. The pH-dependence of V(max) shows one transition in the acidic pH range with pK(a)=5.4, and the pH-dependence of V(max)/K(m) exhibits two transitions with pK(a)=5.4 and 8.5. Based on analysis of alternative substrates and molecular modelling studies, it was concluded that the pK(a) at the acidic pH range corresponds to the active site residues Asp115 or Glu82, whereas the pK(a) observed at the alkaline pH range is not due to substrate amino group ionisation, but rather is the result of enzyme ionisation. The effect of temperature and viscosity on the catalytic activity of the enzyme was also investigated and it was concluded that the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction is relevant to structural transitions of the protein. Thermodynamic analysis of the activity data showed that the activation energies are dependent on the substrate, and entropy changes appear to be the main determinant contributing to substrate specificity.","['Kotzia, Georgia A', 'Labrou, Nikolaos E']","['Kotzia GA', 'Labrou NE']","['Laboratory of Enzyme Technology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, Iera Odos 75, 11855 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Biotechnol,Journal of biotechnology,8411927,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asparaginase/*analysis/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Catalysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', '*Models, Chemical', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pectobacterium carotovorum/*enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Temperature']",2005/06/14 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-1656(05)00180-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbiotec.2005.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biotechnol. 2005 Oct 10;119(4):309-23. doi: 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2005.04.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Blind randomized study. SETTING: University research laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Twenty-seven mature female mice. INTERVENTION(S): Single-dose anastrozole (25 mg/kg [0.75 mg]), recombinant FSH (5 IU/mL), and hCG (5 IU/mL) (n = 9); recombinant FSH (5 IU/mL) and hCG (5 IU/mL) (n = 9); or sterile saline (1 mL) (n = 9). The morning of finding the vaginal plug was designated as day 1 of embryonic development (E1). Three mice from each group were sacrificed on E1 and embryos aspirated from uterine tubes. The rest of the mice were sacrificed on E2.5-3 and uteruses removed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryo quality, endometrial histologic evaluation, and immunohistochemical analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor, laminin, and collagen IV staining. RESULT(S): Anastrozole use in FSH-induced cycles not only caused an increase in preimplantation receptivity and implantation but also supported release of implantation markers. The enhanced embryo development seen in this study would explain the higher implantation because embryo development is synchronized with endometrial development. CONCLUSION(S): In mice, the use of anastrozole in FSH-induced cycles has a positive effect on embryo quality and implantation. This effect might be species dependent, and human studies are needed.","['Karaer, Oznur', 'Vatansever, H Seda', 'Oruc, Semra', 'Ozbilgin, Kemal', 'Cilaker, Serap', 'Koyuncu, M Faik']","['Karaer O', 'Vatansever HS', 'Oruc S', 'Ozbilgin K', 'Cilaker S', 'Koyuncu MF']",['oznurkaraer@yahoo.com'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '2Z07MYW1AZ (Anastrozole)']",IM,"['Anastrozole', 'Animals', 'Aromatase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Embryonic Development/*drug effects/physiology', 'Estrous Cycle/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Ovulation Induction/*methods', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",2005/06/14 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2004/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(05)00545-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.01.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2005 Jun;83(6):1797-806. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.01.100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: PHCs and SW1353 cells were cultured as high density monolayer cultures with and without 1ng/ml interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). RNA was isolated and assayed using a custom-made oligonucleotide microarray representing 312 chondrocyte-relevant genes. The expression levels of selected genes were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and the gene expression profiles of the two cell types, both with and without IL-1beta treatment, were compared. RESULTS: Overall, gene expression profiling showed only very limited similarities between SW1353 cells and PHCs at the transcriptional level. Similarities were predominantly seen with respect to catabolic effects after IL-1beta treatment. In both cell systems matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-3 and MMP-13 were strongly induced by IL-1beta, without significant induction of MMP-2. IL-6 was also found to be up-regulated by IL-1beta in both cellular models. On the other hand, intercellular mediators such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) were not induced by IL-1beta in SW1353 cells, but significantly up-regulated in PHCs. Bioinformatical analysis identified nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) as a common transcriptional regulator of IL-1beta induced genes in both SW1353 cells and PHCs, whereas other transcription factors were only found to be relevant for individual cell systems. CONCLUSION: Our data characterize SW1353 cells as a cell line with only a very limited potential to mimic PHCs, though SW1353 cells can be of value to study the induction of protease expression within cells, a phenomenon also seen in chondrocytes.","['Gebauer, M', 'Saas, J', 'Sohler, F', 'Haag, J', 'Soder, S', 'Pieper, M', 'Bartnik, E', 'Beninga, J', 'Zimmer, R', 'Aigner, T']","['Gebauer M', 'Saas J', 'Sohler F', 'Haag J', 'Soder S', 'Pieper M', 'Bartnik E', 'Beninga J', 'Zimmer R', 'Aigner T']","['Department of Genomic Sciences, Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt, FR Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,9305697,"['0 (BMP2 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics', 'Cartilage, Articular/*cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chondrocytes/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2005/06/14 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2004/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1063-4584(05)00100-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.joca.2005.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005 Aug;13(8):697-708. doi: 10.1016/j.joca.2005.04.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the integrity and survival of HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells following short-term (90 min) exposure to the dietary abundant flavonoid kaempferol (1-100 microM) is reported. Supplementation initially decreased reactive oxygen levels but, paradoxically, a dose-dependent increase in single-strand DNA breakage occurred. However, there was no increase in oxidised DNA purines or membrane damage. Following a 24-h recovery period in non-kaempferol supplemented media, DNA single-strand breakage had declined and kaempferol exposed and control cultures possessed similar reactive oxygen levels. A reduction in (3)H-thymidine incorporation occurred with > or =10 microM kaempferol. One hundred micromolar kaempefrol increased the proportion of cells in G(2)-M phase, the proportion of cells with a sub-G(1) DNA content and enhanced 'active' caspase-3 expression but only induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential within a minority of cells.

Celluar uptake and effective internalization of antibody-conjugated nanoparticles into CD3 expressing cells were demonstrated. Uptake rates of about 84% into T-cell leukemia cells were observed. To confirm selectivity of T-cell targeting, competition experiments were carried out adding excessive free anti-CD3 prior to nanoparticle incubation leading to significantly reduced cellular uptake of antibody-conjugated nanoparticles.

METHODS: By DNA microarray technique, genes differentially expressed by K562-n/VCR and K562-n cell lines were identified and analyzed. RESULTS: DNA microarray analysis of K562-n/VCR and K562-n cells was repeated three times and revealed 58 genes significantly differentially expressed among 12,800 genes arrayed. All but one was up-regulated in K562-n/VCR cells. The only gene down-regulated was a-myb. The up-regulated genes were MDR-associated genes, oncogenes, cytoskeleton, protein kinases and phosphatases, apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors, metabolism, transcriptional regulators associated with stress response, cell cycle checkpoint control, and genes for signal transduction proteins. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, besides MDR-associated genes, other known and unknown genes may also be involved in the mechanism of multi-drug resistance.","['Chen, Li', 'Xu, Xiao-ping', 'Wang, Jian-min', 'Li, Yao', 'Xu, Hong', 'Lu, Shu-qing', 'Fei, Xin-hong', 'Huang, Zheng-xia']","['Chen L', 'Xu XP', 'Wang JM', 'Li Y', 'Xu H', 'Lu SQ', 'Fei XH', 'Huang ZX']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2005/06/14 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2005 Apr;27(4):196-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The B7 molecules expression on fresh acute leukemia cells and on the IL-7 exposed leukemia cells was detected by FACScan cytometer. B7-1 and B7-2 mRNA in IL-7 treated HL-60 cells were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The stimulation of proliferation of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by IL-7 treated leukemia cells was detected by MTT method. The level of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secreted by the stimulated PBMNC was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The blocking experiments were performed using monoclonal antibodies against B7-1, B7-2 and W6/32. RESULTS: B7-1 was weakly expressed in three, whereas B7-2 did in only one of eleven AL patients. IL-7 significantly enhanced B7 molecules expression on AL cells in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, IL-7 could induce higher expression of B7-1 and B7-2 mRNAs on HL-60 cells. IL-7 treated leukemia cells could stimulate PBMNC proliferation and promote their IFN-gamma production. Anti-B7-1 and anti W6/32 but not anti-B7-2 monoclonal antibodies significantly inhibited the stimulated PBMNC proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion. CONCLUSION: Fresh AL cells express low level of B7-1 and B7-2 molecules. IL-7 enhances the B7 molecules expression on AL cells. The IL-7-treated leukemia cells can significantly stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic PBMNC and induce their IFN gamma secretion.","['Qian, Wen-bin', 'Lin, Mao-fang']","['Qian WB', 'Lin MF']","['First Affiliated Hospital, Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2005/06/14 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 May;26(5):289-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twelve patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 4), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M(2), n = 2), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML, n = 4), and myelodysplastic syndromes-refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB, n = 2) were intolerant of conventional myeloablative therapy because of age (older than 50 years) or having severe concurrent diseases. The median age was 49 years (range 42-64 years). Seven were males and five females. Two of the 12 patients were HLA one antigen-mismatched and the rest HLA identical with their donors. The low dosage conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan (2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) for 3 days), Ara-C (2 g.m(-2).d(-1) for 1 or 2 times), cyclophosphamide (1.0 g.m(-2).d(-1) for 2 days) and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG 2.5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) for 4 days, -5 - -2 day). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were harvested (1 patient using PBSC alone). All patients received cyclosporin A, short-term MTX and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). DNA short tandem repeat (STR) sequence analysis, cytogenetics and molecular-biologic technique were used to analyze chimerism. RESULTS: All the patients were well tolerated the regimen, with no severe regimen related toxicity. In all the 12 patients, absolute neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x10(9)/L was achieved in 11 to 17 (median 15) days and platelet count > 20 x 10(9)/L in 10 to 23 (median 15) days after transplantation. Complete chimerism was achieved in 11 patients and 1 patient was in mixed chimerism at one month after HSCT. With a median follow-up of 14.5 (4.0-24.0) months, 7 of the 12 patients (58.0%) were alive and 5 (42.0%) of the 7 were disease-free. The probabilities of OS and DFS at 12 months were 75.0% and 48.1%. Five patients (41.6%) had aGVHD and four had local chronic GVHD with a cumulative probability of chronic GVHD of 41.5%. CONCLUSION: This reduced intensity conditioning regimen is well tolerated and safe for HSCT in the older patients or patients with severe concurrent medical conditions and can achieve full chimerism and long-term disease-free survival.","['Chen, Huan', 'Lu, Dao-pei', 'Huang, Xiao-jun', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Xu, Lan-ping', 'Han, Wei', 'Ren, Han-yun', 'Chen, Yu-hong', 'Liu, Dai-hong', 'Lu, Jin', 'Jiang, Qian']","['Chen H', 'Lu DP', 'Huang XJ', 'Liu KY', 'Xu LP', 'Han W', 'Ren HY', 'Chen YH', 'Liu DH', 'Lu J', 'Jiang Q']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University, People's Hospital, Beiging 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2005/06/14 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 May;26(5):273-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those with elevated dopamine were identified and the explanation for this finding was sought. RESULTS: In adults, the conditions associated with an elevated dopamine were: urine over-collection; drug effects (including those due to intravenous dopamine, L-dopa, methyldopa, clozapine, antidepressants and metoclopramide); clinical effects (including those due to phaeochromocytoma, carcinoid tumour and pregnancy). In children, high urine dopamine was found in cases of neuroblastoma, Costello syndrome, leukaemia, phaeochromocytoma, Menkes disease and rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder.

Such tests are, however, work intensive and, in the case of the DiSC-assay, require at least four days. Induction of apoptosis is the mode of action of anticancer drugs and should, therefore, result in the induction of caspase activation in cells targeted by anticancer therapy. METHODS: To determine, whether caspase activation can predict the chemosensitivity, we investigated enzyme activation of caspase-3, a key executioner caspase and correlated these data with chemosensitivity profiles of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. RESULTS: There was, however, no correlation between the ex-vivo chemosensitivity assessed by measuring the overall rates of cell death by use of the DiSC-assay and caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSION: Thus, despite a significant reduction of duration of the assay from four to one day, induction of apoptosis evaluated by caspase-3 activity does not seem to be a valid surrogate marker for chemosensitivity.","['Staib, Peter', 'Tiehen, Jan', 'Strunk, Timo', 'Schinkothe, Timo']","['Staib P', 'Tiehen J', 'Strunk T', 'Schinkothe T']","['Clinic I for Internal Medicine, The University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50924 Cologne, Germany. peter.staib@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2005/06/14 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-5-60 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-60 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Jun 11;5:60. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-60.,,,20050611,,,PMC1164407,,,,,,,,

Apart from these classic paraneoplastic dermatoses, there are additional skin disorders reported to occur in close association with haematological and lymphoproliferative disorders which can thus be regarded as paraneoplastic manifestations. We report for the first time two patients with pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta in association with mycosis fungoides.

An assessment of leukaemia risk is also presented. DESIGN: The 2000 annual means of benzene atmospheric concentrations in 73 sites has been derived using a procedure which integrated data from fixed site stations and passive samplers: on this basis, an annual mean for the whole urban area has been calculated. The population exposure trend for the period 1980-2000 has been estimated using the information on traffic emission changes. The expected annual number of leukaemia cases attributable to benzene has been calculated by using two different approaches. SETTING: Residents in the urban area of Modena. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual incidence of leukaemia attributable to benzene. RESULTS: In 2000, the mean urban concentration was about 7 microg/m3 and in average the population was exposed to about 9 microg/m3. In the eighties, the population exposure was 5 times higher than the 2000 value, with a maximum of 51 microg/m3 in 1988. The leukaemia risk assessment procedures gave a value of about 4 x 10(-1) with the method based on cumulative exposure and of about 4 x 10(-2) with the method based on weighted exposure. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study is one of the few examples of evaluation of both the trend in benzene exposure for a population and assessment of leukaemia risk. Uncertainties in the assessment of health impact derive from inconsistencies in the underlyng methods.","['Zauli Sajani, Stefano', 'Forti, Stefano', 'Lauriola, Paolo']","['Zauli Sajani S', 'Forti S', 'Lauriola P']","['Struttura tematica di epidemiologia ambientale, ARPA Emilia Romagna, Modena. szauli@epam.arpa.emr.it']",['ita'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,"['2P299V784P (Lead)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Catchment Area, Health', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Lead/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Urban Population']",2005/06/14 09:00,2005/07/19 09:00,['2005/06/14 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['2005/E&P1/E&P1_13_art1.pdf [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2005 Jan-Feb;29(1):13-8.,,,,,,,,,,Esposizione al benzene a Modena: andamento storico e valutazione del rischio sanitari.,,,,

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of combined fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone (FND) followed by interferon/dexamethasone on myelosuppression (absolute neutrophil counts), immunosuppression (CD4 and CD8 counts), and infectious complications in patients with previously untreated, Stage IV indolent lymphoma. METHODS: Seventy-three patients were treated. All patients received Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. CD4 and CD8 counts, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and neutrophil counts were correlated with infectious complications. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 6.1 years. Sixty of 73 patients had CD4, CD8, or Ig measurements. The median baseline CD4 count was 764/microL. This CD4 level decreased to 238/microL at 1 year and to 264/microL at 2 years; and it rose to 431/microL by 3 years and to 650/microL at 4 years. CD8 counts did not change significantly. The median baseline serum IgG level was 989 mg/d, decreased to 536 mg/dL at 1 year and to 693 mg/dL at 2 years, and it rose to 949 mg/dL at 3 years and to 1080 mg/dL at 4 years. Fourteen patients (19%) developed Grade 3-4 infections, the majority during FND therapy with neutropenia and/or accompanied by CD4 counts < 200/microL. CD4, CD8, and neutrophil counts did not differ between patients who developed Grade 3-4 infections, Grade 1-2 infections, or no infections. CONCLUSIONS: Most infections with FND occurred during FND, in the setting of neutropenia, often with concurrent low CD4 counts. The overall safety profile for FND was good. However, patients should be monitored for opportunistic infections, and prophylactic antibiotics are recommended, particularly against PCP.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Younes, Anas', 'Romaguera, Jorge', 'Hagemeister, Fredrick B', 'Rodriguez, Maria A', 'Feng, Lei', 'Ayala, Ana', 'Smith, Terry L', 'Cabanillas, Fernando', 'McLaughlin, Peter']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Younes A', 'Romaguera J', 'Hagemeister FB', 'Rodriguez MA', 'Feng L', 'Ayala A', 'Smith TL', 'Cabanillas F', 'McLaughlin P']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

ARF was investigated in children in the south-southern part of Nigeria to determine the prevalence, aetiology, management and outcome of ARF. A retrospective review of data from all children from birth to 16 years of age admitted into the Department of Paediatrics, University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), with the diagnosis of ARF over an 18 year period (January 1985 to December 2003) was performed. Information was obtained about the age, sex, clinical features, blood pressure, laboratory and radiological investigations, aetiology, and treatment received including dialysis. Information on the outcome, factors influencing outcome, and possible causes of death were reviewed. There were 211 patients, 138 (65.4%) males and 73 (34.6%) females (M:F, 1.9:1), with a hospital prevalence of 11.7 cases/year. The patients were aged 5 days to 16 years (mean 5.6+/-4.7 years). Oliguria was the most common clinical presentation in 184 (87.2%) patients. Hypertension was seen in only 39 (18.5%) patients. The causes were age-related. The neonates had ARF from severe birth asphyxia 27 (35.5%), septicaemia 17 (22.4%), with tetanus 4 (5.3%) and congenital malformations 11 (14.5%). Sixty-one (28.9%) and 29 (13.7%) patients had ARF from gastroenteritis and malaria respectively. The patients with leukaemia were all more than 10 years old and had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Two patients (1.9%) had Burkitts lymphoma involving the abdomen and 3 patients had HIVAN. 112 (53%) patients had anaemia with a mean haematocrit of 20.25+/-6.9%. Dialysis was indicated in 108 patients, but only 24 patients (22.2%) had peritoneal dialysis (PD), because of financial constraints and lack of dialysis equipment. Mortality rate was 40.5%.

Hypertension (X2 15.7, P<0.001) and lack of dialysis (X2 7.96, P<0.01) significantly affected outcome. Other factors associated with demise were delayed presentation (58.8%), use of herbal treatment (35%), and unaffordability of treatment (40%). ARF is a significant cause of mortality in Nigerian children. The patients are not adequately managed because of poverty and lack of facilities for dialysis. The causes of ARF in our environment are preventable, and should be expected.","['Anochie, Ifeoma C', 'Eke, Felicia U']","['Anochie IC', 'Eke FU']","['University of Port Harcourt, PMB 5160, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. anochieify@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Nigeria']",2005/06/11 09:00,2006/03/30 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00467-005-1984-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2005 Nov;20(11):1610-4. doi: 10.1007/s00467-005-1984-8.

METHODS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was applied to separate the total proteins of cells. The silver-stained gels were analysed by 2-DE software Image Master 2D Elite. Selected differential protein spots were identified with peptide mass fingerprinting based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and database searching. RESULTS: The protein endothelial cell growth factor 1 (platelet-derived), rhotekin protein (RTKN), septin 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 11, tyrosinase-related protein-2, translin-like protein, and DNA directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide J-related gene isoform 2 appeared in metastatic but were not detected in non-metastatic cell lines, whereas integrin-linked kinase-associated protein phosphatase 2C isoform 2, MHC class I promoter binding protein, protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B' (PR 53), carboxypeptidase A5, paired box transcription factor, zinc finger protein 79, and apolipoprotein B-48 were detected in non-metastatic but were absent in metastatic cell lines. In addition, cyclin fold protein 1 variant A and pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 were lowly expressed in the non-metastatic cell line and were significantly upregulated in the metastatic cell line.

Thoracentesis is often performed to diagnose infection and to exclude the presence of complicated parapneumonic effusions. The efficacy and safety of thoracentesis in this setting has not been well-studied. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing thoracentesis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of thoracentesis in establishing a diagnosis of infection in this population and to determine the risk of complications. RESULTS: A total of 100 thoracentesis findings were analyzed in patients with lymphoma (52 patients) and leukemia (27 patients), and in patients who had undergone bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (21 patients). The indication for performing thoracentesis was to exclude infection in 69% of cases. Fever was present in 59% of the patients, and a concomitant lung parenchymal abnormality was present in 69% of cases. Effusions were moderate to large in size (87% of cases), and were both bilateral (62%) and unilateral (38%). Exudates were documented in 83%of the cases. A specific diagnosis was found in 21 patients and was more frequently established in those with lymphoma (31%) compared to the other groups of patients. Diagnoses found included malignancy in 14 cases, chylous effusions in 6 cases, and infection in 1 case. The one patient in whom empyema was found required drainage. The criteria for a parapneumonic effusion were not found in any other patients. The complication rate of 9% (pneumothorax, seven patients; hemothorax, two patients) was comparable to that in other populations of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high propensity for developing pulmonary infections, hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies rarely developed complex parapneumonic effusions. The etiology of many of the effusions that occurred in this setting was unclear.","['Bass, Jon', 'White, Dorothy A']","['Bass J', 'White DA']","['Department of Medicine, Pulmonary Section, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Pneumonia/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Thoracostomy/*methods/mortality']",2005/06/11 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-3692(15)49815-0 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.127.6.2101 [doi]']",ppublish,Chest. 2005 Jun;127(6):2101-5. doi: 10.1378/chest.127.6.2101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose alkylator chemotherapy does not further improve outcome. This phase II study evaluated a novel high-dose chemotherapy regimen which combined active breast cancer agents with differing mechanisms of action. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility included at least seven involved axillary nodes (AxLNs) for tumours <5 cm, at least four AxLNs for tumours >5 cm or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Patients received four cycles of fluorouracil-adriamycin-cyclophosphamide (FAC) followed by one cycle of mitoxantrone 63 mg/m(2)-vinblastine 12.5 mg/m(2)-cyclophosphamide 6 g/m(2) (MVC) with autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ASCT). RESULTS: Between April 1995 and December 1998, 92 patients aged 21-65 years (median 45 years) were enrolled, of whom 25 were treated preoperatively for LABC and 67 were treated postoperatively. Although there was no early treatment-related mortality, one late death occurred from secondary acute myeloid leukaemia. The 7-year event-free and overall survival rates were 53% (95% confidence interval 42-64%) and 62% (95% CI 52-73%), respectively, with no significant difference between pre- and postoperative groups. CONCLUSION: FAC followed by MVC-ASCT is feasible and reasonably well tolerated, but does not result in improved survival rates compared with other conventional or high-dose regimens for stage III breast cancer.","['Stewart, D A', 'Paterson, A H G', 'Ruether, J D', 'Russell, J', 'Craighead, P', 'Smylie, M', 'Mackey, J']","['Stewart DA', 'Paterson AH', 'Ruether JD', 'Russell J', 'Craighead P', 'Smylie M', 'Mackey J']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Calgary, Canada. douglast@cancerboard.ab.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",2005/06/11 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)54975-4 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdi268 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2005 Sep;16(9):1463-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdi268.

METHODS: Kasumi-1 cells were treated with PB and 5-Aza-CdR at different concentrations in suspension culture. Cellular proliferation was determined by the MTT assay, expression of myeloid-specific differentiation antigen and cell cycles were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis were assessed using AnnexinV/PI staining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment of Kasumi-1 cells with PB caused a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation, with an IC(50) of 2.3 mmol/L. When combined with 5-Aza-CdR, PB resulted in a greater growth inhibition with an IC(50) of 1.95 mmol/L. Treatment of Kasumi-1 cells with PB resulted in cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1), while combined treatment with PB and 5-Aza-CdR led to cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M. Expression of myeloid cell differentiation antigens CD11b and CD13 induced by PB was enhanced when Kasumi-1 cells were pretreated with low dose of 5-Aza-CdR. High, but not low, concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR could enhance early apoptosis of Kasumi-1 cells induced by PB. CONCLUSION: Phenylbuty rate, when combined with 5-Aza-CdR, inhibits AML cell in vitro proliferation and increases apoptosis in a synergistic fashion.","['Hao, Chang-lai', 'Tang, Ke-jing', 'Chen, Sen', 'Xing, Hai-yan', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jian-xiang']","['Hao CL', 'Tang KJ', 'Chen S', 'Xing HY', 'Wang M', 'Wang JX']","['Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union of Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'CD13 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology']",2005/06/11 09:00,2006/05/10 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2005 Mar;27(3):148-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seven IgHV gene families were respectively amplified by PCR and directly sequenced for 37 childhood B-ALL cases. Bioinformatics were applied for analyzing characteristics of sequences available and predicting HLA-A*0201 molecule-binding nonapeptides derived from IgHV. The predicted nonapeptide QLVQSGAEV was synthesized and its binding affinity to T2 cells determined. CD8+ T cells from a healthy HLA-A*0201+ donor peripheral blood were stimulated repeatedly with QLVQSGAEV-loaded antigen presenting cells. RESULTS: IgHV gene rearrangements were identified in 37 B-ALL. Forty IgHV gene sequences available preferentially utilized V(H)4-59 and V(H)4-34 gene segments. Increased frequency (15.4%) of D7-27 in B-ALL IgHV was found compared to that reported for adult PBLs (P = 0.02); 20.0% DJ(H) junctions in B-ALL lacked non-encoding nucleotides, a frequency higher than that reported for adult PBLs (P = 0.02). 17.5% B-ALL IgHV contained < 2% replacement mutations. Forty B-ALL IgHV sequences acquired 12 high HLA-A*0201-binding nonapeptides, 10 (83.0%) peptides were located in frame region (FR)1 and 3. The synthesized peptide QLVQSGAEV up-regulated HLA-A*0201 expression 1.63 fold on the surface of T2 cells. The frequency of QLVQSGAEV-specific CD8+ T cells in a healthy HLA-A*0201+ donor peripheral blood increased from 1.6% and 82.6% after two-round and 3-round stimulations, respectively. CONCLUSION: IgHV genes in childhood B-ALL are of germline characteristics. Their heavy chain framework regions contain HLA-A*0201-binding nonapeptides.

The expression of VEGFR in leukemia cells was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) in 26 cases of acute leukemia (AL) [(20.78 +/- 7.75)/high-power field (HP)] and 5 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [(28.67 +/- 7.32)/HP] at newly diagnosed stage was significantly higher than that in the control group [(9.29 +/- 3.53)/HP, P < 0.01]. The bone marrow MVD in the complete remission (CR) groups, (11.33 +/- 5.66)/HP for AL and (17.00 +/- 8.04)/HP for CML, was significantly lower than that of newly diagnosed groups (P < 0.05 and < 0.01).

METHODS: Thirty previously untreated cases of Ph+ B-ALL were diagnosed in our institute. The patients were treated with combination chemotherapy of CODP +/- L regimen, Imatinib (400 approximately 600 mg/d) was continuously given to those who couldn't reach CR. Fourteen patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after CR, while 16 received consolidation of intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Thirty (32.6%) of 92 ALL patients were diagnosed as Ph+ ALL, with a median age of 25.5 (14 - 60). Among them Ph+ as the sole anomaly was seen in 16 patients, and Ph+ with additional chromosome abnormalities in 14. Besides the B cell markers, 23 (76.7%) patients had CD34+ and 13 (43.3%) CD13+ and/or CD33+. Nineteen of the Ph+ ALL patients underwent molecular analysis; 13 (68.4%) expressed P190 and 6 (31.6%) P210. Increased WBC (> 30 x 10(9)/L) was found in 22/30 cases while WBC > 100 x 10(9)/L in 9/30 cases. The chemotherapy complete remission rate was 68.8% in patients with only Ph+ versus 28.6% in those with additional chromosome abnormalities. All seven refractory/relapsed patients reached CR with Imatinib therapy. The total complete remission rate was 73.3% in all Ph+ ALL patients. The median remission duration was shorter in patients with additional chromosome than in those with only Ph+ (1 vs 7 months, P < 0.05), and so was the survival period (7 vs 9 months, P > 0.05). The remission duration was significantly longer in patients received allo-HSCT than in those received chemotherapy only (8 vs 0.5 month, P < 0.05), and so was the survival period (12.5 vs 6 months, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Additional chromosome abnormalities negatively affect the prognosis and therapeutic effect of Ph+ ALL patients. Imatinib is effective for the induction therapy of Ph+ ALL. The survival period of patients who received allo-HSCT was obviously longer than those who received chemotherapy only.","['Bao, Li', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Huang, Xiao-jun', 'Wang, De-bing', 'Qiu, Jing-ying', 'Lu, Xi-jing', 'Chen, Huan', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Bao L', 'Jiang B', 'Huang XJ', 'Wang DB', 'Qiu JY', 'Lu XJ', 'Chen H', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2005/06/11 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jan;26(1):31-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 121 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (497 infusions of HDMTX) were analysed in this study. The elimination delay rate and the adverse effects in different dose groups (3 g/m2 vs 5 g/m2) and different infusion duration groups (7 h vs 24 h) were compared. The adverse effect evaluation was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Toxicity Grading Criteria. The rescue dosages of calcium folinate (CF) among these groups were compared through CF/MTX index. RESULTS: The overall morbidity of elimination delay was 12.1% with a relative risk of 30.6% for the first time. The relative risk for the second time of occurrence was increased to 45.9% (P < 0.01) and it was not significantly increased for the third time (35.3%). Children with elimination delay had lower platelet count (P < 0.01) and higher CF rescue dosage (P < 0.01), while the damage of oral mucous membrane was more severe (P < 0.05) and the next course of chemotherapy would be postponed for a median of 4 days in 3 g group.

The only side effect occurred in 5 g group was gastrointestinal morbidity. The CF/MTX index of 5 g group without elimination delay was less than that of 3 g group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Elimination delay in HDMTX therapy accompanies the suppression of bone marrow and damage of oral mucous membrane, which need more CF rescues and will postpone the following course of chemotherapy. Elimination delay is not associated with the duration of the infusion and the dosage of MTX within the range of 3 approximately 5 g/m2 but there are individual differences.","['Xu, Wei-qun', 'Tang, Yong-min', 'Fang, Cheng-qing', 'Song, Hua', 'Shi, Shu-wen', 'Yang, Shi-long', 'Ren, Ding-tai', 'Shen, Hong-qiang', 'Qian, Bai-qin']","['Xu WQ', 'Tang YM', 'Fang CQ', 'Song H', 'Shi SW', 'Yang SL', 'Ren DT', 'Shen HQ', 'Qian BQ']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/chemically induced', 'Young Adult']",2005/06/11 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jan;26(1):15-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression rates and levels of p21 (77.8% and 1.18 +/- 0.21) and p27 (48.1% and 1.14 +/- 0.40) in MDS were statistically higher than those in normal control and AML. The expression level of p57 in MDS (0.69 +/- 0.06) was higher than that (0.53 +/- 0.05, P < 0.01) in normal control but lower than in AML (0.96 +/- 0.16, P < 0.01). The expression rate (55.6%) and level (0.85 +/- 0.17) of Rb in MDS were significantly higher than those in normal control and AML. The expression rate (7.4%) and level (0.39 +/- 0.04) of E2F1 in MDS were comparable to those in normal control but lower than those in AML. CONCLUSION: MDS clones have aberrant mechanism of cell cycle control: high expressions of cyclin family members, CDK2 and CDK6 may lead to high proliferation; high expression of p21 and p27 may cause the G1 phase arrest.","['Shi, Jun', 'Shao, Zong-hong', 'Liu, Hong', 'Jia, Hai-rong', 'Sun, Juan', 'Bai, Jie', 'Cao, Yan-ran', 'Wang, Xiu-li', 'Tu, Mei-feng']","['Shi J', 'Shao ZH', 'Liu H', 'Jia HR', 'Sun J', 'Bai J', 'Cao YR', 'Wang XL', 'Tu MF']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*genetics', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2005/06/11 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jan;26(1):10-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From January 1998 to May 2003, 193 patients with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled on protocol of ALL-XH-99. BM blast counts on day 19 and on CR after induction therapy were examined. BM MRD at the end of induction therapy was detected by MP-FCM. RESULTS: (1) The probability of 5-year event-free survival (pEFS) was significantly worse for patients with > or = 0.050 BM lymphoblasts on day 19 than that with < 0.050 BM lymphoblasts [(42.59 +/- 14.28)% vs (74.24 +/- 6.67)%, P < 0.001]. (2) The 5-year pEFS was significantly worse for patients with a low percentage of lymphoblasts (< 0.050) in BM on CR as compared to those with no morphological persistent lymphoblasts [(63.47 +/- 9.23)% vs (76.41 +/- 6.09)%, P < 0.05]. (3) No significant difference was found in BM lymphoblasts between patients with MRD (> or = 10(-4) of nucleated bone marrow cells) and those without MRD (< 10(-4)) at the end of induction therapy (P > 0.05).

METHODS: Serial monitoring of bcr/abl mRNA levels by real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique (RQ-PCR) was performed in 34 cases (120 samples) of CML treated with imatinib mesylate. All the patients were IFNalpha based treatment failure before enrolled in this study and the percentage of Ph(+) bone marrow cells were over 95%. RESULTS: The sensitivity of RQ-PCR was 10 pg RNA, with both coefficients of interassay and intraassay variation below 5% for standard samples. The median bcr/abl mRNA level of 10 patients' samples pre imatinib treatment was 5.79% with marked variation (0.24%-60.90%). In 72 samples post imatinib treatment, which the rates of Ph(+) cells [Ph(+)%] were between 0 and 94%, the mRNA level well correlated with Ph(+)% (r = 0.82, P < 0.001). The mRNA levels of 7 patients who achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within 12 months decreased markedly, the levels of 6 analysable patients decreased by 65.9% - 98.8% after 3 months'treatment accordingly. The level further decreased to 0 after achieving CCyR. For 4 patients who achieved major cytogenetic response (Ph(+) cells < 35%) later than 12 months, the mRNA levels decreased slowly. The levels of 3 analysable patients on 3 month therapy decreased by 2.5%, 18.5% and 61.6% compared with that before treatment. Out of 5 patients in chronic phase without cytogenetic response, 1 decreased, 2 increased gradually and 2 had no change. In 4 disease progression patients, the levels increased stepwise. CONCLUSIONS: Serial quantifications of bcr/abl mRNA levels are necessary for imatinib treated patients, and are more informative than a single detection.

At recurrence, some patients show changes in immunophenotype and cytogenetics. Drug resistance, the main cause of refractoriness of AML, is related to abnormal genes expression. This study was to detect differential expression of genes in naive and recurrent/refractory AML, and explore potential mechanisms of recurrent/refractory AML. METHODS: Differential gene expressions of bone marrow mononuclear cells between naive and recurrent/refractory diseases in 5 self-paired patients with AML-M(2a) were detected by DNA microarray. RESULTS: In 925 tested genes, 14 were differentially expressed between naive and recurrent/refractory diseases in the 5 self-paired patients. Of the 14 genes, 12 (involved in signal transduction, DNA replication, regulation of transcription, RNA processing, and regulation of cell cycle) were obviously up-regulated in recurrent diseases, and up-regulation of RRM1 (involved in DNA replication) was the most obvious. CONCLUSIONS: Development of recurrent/refractory AML-M(2a) is concerned with various genes. Up-regulation of these genes suggests that proliferation of recurrent/refractory AML-M(2a) blasts may be higher than that of naive AML-M(2a) blasts.","['Tang, Jia-Ming', 'Meng, Fan-Yi', 'Chen, An-Wei']","['Tang JM', 'Meng FY', 'Chen AW']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, South China Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.

METHODS: Multiparameter high-resolution flow cytometry with a panel of 25 different monoclonal antibodies was used to analyze the surface and cytoplasmic antigens expressions of 96 adults with AML; G-binding technique was used to analyze karyotype of 73 of the 96 patients. RESULTS: In these AML patients, some antigens were correlated with FAB subtypes:expression of CD2 was enhanced in AML-M3; HLA-DR, CD34, and CD56 were absent in AML-M3; expression of CD19 was increased in AML-M2; expressions of CD14 and CD56 were enhanced in AML-M5; MPO was absent in AML-M0. Karyotype abnormality was detected in 40(54.8%) patients. CD22, CD56, and TdT expressions were correlated with karyotype abnormality. t(8; 21) was only detected in 10 AML-M2 patients with high expressions of CD15, CD19, CD34, and CD56; no lymphoid lineage antigens were detected in 7 AML-M3 patients with t (15; 17). Expressions of CD4 and TdT were positively correlated with patient's age; expressions of CD7 and CD14 were positively correlated with high white blood cell count; expressions of CD4, CD14, and CD56 were positively correlated with high platelet count.

In 2001, transformation to secondary AML with an increase in bone marrow blasts (>20%) and thrombocytopenia, was found. The patient did not require cytoreductive drugs. Rather, during the following months, spontaneous improvement of peripheral blood cells with normalization of platelets and decrease in the red cell transfusion frequency, were noted. In October 2002, she even became transfusion independent. However, the bone marrow still showed AML with >20% blasts. These blast cells exhibited a monoclonal pattern in the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) assay. However, no chromosomal defects occurred during a total observation period of 14 yr.

The objective of this study was to evaluate such an approach in the treatment of localized murine AML (acute myelogenous leukemia). For this purpose we designed an experimental model in which leukemic cells were embedded in 1% agar discs before subcutaneous implantation in C57Bl female mice. The C-1498 AML cell line (Frederick Inst., NCI, MD, USA) was used. Thirty experimental mice received on alternate days injections of 5 x 2.5 microg anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and 5 x 2.5 microg anti-Flk-1 (VEGFR2) antibodies to the site of cell implantation over a period of 10 d. Fifteen control mice received daily PBS injections. All mice were sacrificed 16 d after AML implantation. Of the 30 experimental animals, macroscopic examination showed in 21 animals (70%) small sized, pale tumors (0.5 g); in six mice (20%) the tumors were replaced completely by necrotic tissue, while in three mice (10%), there were large (2.5 g), highly vascularized tumors. In all 15 control mice large highly vascularized tumors were seen. A separate group of mice was studied for total survival following AML implantation. While 12 mice in the control group not treated with antibodies survived for 16 d post-implantation, survival was prolonged in 15 antibody treated mice by approximate 30 d to a total survival time of 48 d. Tumor specimens were processed for histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD31 endothelial cell antigen, and tube-like formation assay. The small, pale tumors of antibody treated animals consisted of degenerate hyaline material with remnant nests of leukemic cells, whereas large tumors showed sheets of leukemic cells and numerous blood vessels. Specimens processed for CD31 antigen showed scarce or absence of blood vessels in the small, pale tumors in contrast to intensive staining from a rich network of blood vessels in the large, highly vascularized tumors. Tube-like formation assays disclosed rudimentary Grade 1 endothelial cell tubes in the small, pale tumors as opposed to polygonal Grade 4 tube formation in control animals.

METHODS: The proliferation and activation responses of CLL cells were studied in 22-immunoglobulin gene V(H) unmutated (UM-CLL) and 12 hypermutated (M-CLL) CLL cases in 4-day cultures. As the mitogen responses have been previously shown to be diverse in CLL, a case-specific strategy based on optimized mitogen combinations (OMCs) of interleukin-2 (IL-2), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC), and human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) was applied in cell stimulation. The expression of 23 surface membrane antigens (CD5, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD27, CD38, CD40, CD45, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD79b, CD80, CD95, CD124, CD126, CD130, FMC7, IgD, and IgM) was studied by flow cytometry at days 0 and 4. RESULTS: The proliferation and activation responses were similar in UM-CLL and M-CLL when OMCs contained IL-2, TPA or TNF. SAC induced faster proliferation in UM-CLL than in M-CLL. OMC stimulation induced preferential down-regulation of growth- promoting cell surface receptors CD5, CD21, and CD124 and preferential up-regulation of growth-inhibiting antigen CD80 in M-CLL. CONCLUSIONS: Difference in immunophenotypic evolution of UM-CLL and M-CLL can be demonstrated if appropriate matrix signals are provided. The pathways for CD5, CD21, CD124 (IL4R), and CD80 (B7-1) regulation should be further explored in relation with somatic hypermutation and outcome of CLL.","['Vilpo, Juhani', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Hulkkonen, Janne', 'Hurme, Mikko', 'Thunberg, Ulf', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Vilpo, Leena', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Vilpo J', 'Tobin G', 'Hulkkonen J', 'Hurme M', 'Thunberg U', 'Sundstrom C', 'Vilpo L', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Tampere Medical School and Laboratory Center of Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. medivil@kolumbus.fi']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Mitogens/*pharmacokinetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/drug effects/genetics']",2005/06/11 09:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH443 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00443.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Jul;75(1):34-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00443.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.'],,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the results of four consecutive pediatric patients affected by anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor. The conditioning regimen was based on total body irradiation given in association with etoposide in three patients, and with thiotepa and cyclophoshamide in one patient. Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin, a short course of methotrexate and rabbit antithymocyte globulin. RESULTS: All patients had rapid engraftment within 3-4 wk for neutrophils and platelets, and achieved a stable full donor chimerism that has been maintained to the last follow-up visit. One patient later developed a restrictive pneumonopathy. This patient had been heavily pretreated during the course of the disease having suffered four relapses and had received a cumulative dose of bleomycin of 160 mg/m(2). After a follow-up of 11-42 months, all patients are alive in complete hematological and molecular remission; and three of them without any chronic GVHD. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of volunteer bone marrow donors and the reduced toxicity of unrelated stem cell transplantation, especially in children, make this therapeutic option worth more extensive investigation in the treatment of high-risk failure ALCL, although more data is needed to evaluate the long-term benefits. In this regard, the presence of factors predictive of worst outcome such as an early relapse (within 12 months from diagnosis), a refractory or relapsing ALCL and the persistent detection on blood or bone marrow of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein (NPM-ALK) transcript may help select the patients eligible to allogeneic related or unrelated stem cell transplantation.","['Cesaro, S', 'Pillon, M', 'Visintin, G', 'Putti, M C', 'Gazzola, M V', ""D'Amore, E"", 'Scarzello, G', 'Zanesco, L', 'Messina, C', 'Rosolen, A']","['Cesaro S', 'Pillon M', 'Visintin G', 'Putti MC', 'Gazzola MV', ""D'Amore E"", 'Scarzello G', 'Zanesco L', 'Messina C', 'Rosolen A']","['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy. simone.cesaro@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*therapy', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/06/11 09:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2005/06/11 09:00'],"['2005/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH422 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00422.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Jul;75(1):22-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00422.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.'],,,,,

The ribonuclease was purified using a very simple protocol that comprised ion-exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl (CM)-cellulose and affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel. Subsequent gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 75 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the ribonuclease was purified after the first two chromatographic steps. The ribonuclease was adsorbed on CM-cellulose and Affi-gel blue gel. The ribonuclease exhibited the highest activity toward poly A, lower activity toward poly C, slight activity toward poly G, and indiscernible activity toward poly U. The enzyme was stimulated upon exposure to 1 microm Mg2+ and 10 microm Zn2+, but was inhibited by the following ions at 10 mm: Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Fe3+. The ribonuclease required a pH of 8.0 and a temperature of 50-70 degrees C to express maximal activity. It had a Km of 60 microm toward yeast tRNA.

We used TaqMan Low-Density Arrays, a medium-throughput method for real-time RT-PCR using microfluidics to simultaneously assay the expression of 96 genes in nine samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We developed a novel statistical method, based on linear mixed-effects models, to analyze the data. This method automatically identifies the genes whose expression does not vary significantly over the samples, allowing them to be used to normalize the remaining genes. We compared the normalized real-time RT-PCR values with results obtained from Affymetrix Hu133A GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan Low-Density Arrays yielded reproducible measurements over seven orders of magnitude.

ROS and RNS modulate the permissiveness of cells to viral replication, regulate host inflammatory and immune responses, and cause oxidative damage to both host tissue and progeny virus. The lipid-rich nervous system is particularly susceptible to lipid peroxidation, an autocatalytic process that damages lipid-containing structures and yields reactive by-products, which can covalently modify and damage cellular macromolecules. Oxidative injury is a component of acute encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and reovirus, neurodegenerative disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemia virus, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis caused by measles virus.

With the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), two patients with IFN-associated retinopathy who had developed macular edema and reduced visual acuity during the clinical course of IFN therapy were observed. CASES: A 37-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C and a 59-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukemia, both of whom had received IFN therapy, were referred to our outpatient clinic. The former patient had complained once that his visual acuity had decreased after the termination of IFN therapy, and the latter patient complained twice during IFN therapy that his visual acuity had decreased. OBSERVATIONS: In both patients, at the time of the visual disturbances, macular edema was clearly observed by OCT. Hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia were observed at this time also. After the remission of the hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia, the macular edema observed by OCT disappeared and visual acuity returned to normal. CONCLUSION: During and after IFN therapy, OCT is a useful examination technique for revealing macular edema in patients who have decreased vision. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the ocular side effects of IFN therapy and carefully monitor patients for the possible occurrence of hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia.

The present study demonstrates that the polysaccharide peptide (PSP) extracted from the Chinese medicinal mushroom, Coriolus versicolor, used in combination therapy in China, has the ability to lower the cytotoxicity of certain anti-leukemic drugs via their interaction with cell cycle-dependent and apoptotic pathways. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that pre-treatment of PSP (25-100 microg/ml) dose-dependently enhanced the cell cycle perturbation and apoptotic activity of doxorubicin (Doxo) and etoposide (VP-16), but not cytarabine (Ara-C) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. The antagonistic result from combined treatment with Ara-C and PSP may be caused by the removal of HL-60 cells in the G1-S boundary by PSP before exposure to Ara-C. A negative correlation between the increase in apoptotic cell population (pre-G1 peak) with the S-phase cell population expression (R2=0.998), the expression of cyclin E expression (R2=0.872) and caspase 3 activity (R2=0.997) suggests that PSP enhanced the apoptotic machinery of Doxo and VP-16 in a cell cycle-dependent manner and is mediated, at least in part, by the PSP-mediated modulation of the regulatory checkpoint cyclin E and caspase 3. This study is the first to describe the cell cycle mechanistic action of PSP and its interaction with other anticancer agents. Our data support the potential development of PSP as an adjuvant for leukemia treatment, but also imply the importance of understanding its interaction with individual anticancer agents.","['Hui, Kenrie Pui-Yan', 'Sit, Wai-Hung', 'Wan, Jennifer Man-Fan']","['Hui KP', 'Sit WH', 'Wan JM']","['Department of Zoology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, SAR, P.R.

Application of polyoxometalates as potential drugs against Herpes Simplex Virus and AIDS have also increased the interest to study the association between vanadium containing species and proteins. The aim of our research was to investigate the in vitro antiproliferative activity of a variety of vanadium-containing compounds, and study their ability to interfere with the molecular interactions between GATA-1 and NF-kappaB transcription factors and target DNA elements, employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays. All of the used vanadium compounds were found to exhibit antiproliferative activity, despite with differences in efficacy.

In order to address these problems, we investigated an enhancer element identified from individuals with deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin 2 (HPFH2), a genetic condition characterized by elevated levels of gamma-globin in adults. Plasmid transfection studies in erythroid MEL (murine erythroleukemia) cells demonstrated the HPFH2 element could function synergistically with the beta-globin locus control region to enhance the expression of an Agamma-globin gene with a truncated -382 bp promoter. A series of oncoretrovirus vectors were subsequently generated that contain an expression cassette for Agamma-globin linked to various combinations of the HPFH2 enhancer, the alpha-globin HS40 enhancer, and several versions of the promoter from Agamma-globin or beta-globin. Expression analysis in transduced MEL cell clones revealed very high levels of promoter-autonomous silencing that was at least partially abrogated by the HPFH2 enhancer. The vector containing a combination of a -201 bp Agamma-globin gene promoter with the Greek HPFH -117 point mutation and both the HPFH2 and HS40 enhancers exhibited no signs of vector silencing and was expressed at 248+/-99% per copy of mouse alpha-globin (62% of total alpha-globin). This represents a significant improvement over previously reported oncoretrovirus vectors for Agamma-globin, and demonstrates the capacity of the HPFH2 enhancer to abrogate sequence-autonomous silencing of the Agamma-globin promoter in the context of a gene transfer vector.","['Fragkos, M', 'Anagnou, N P', 'Tubb, J', 'Emery, D W']","['Fragkos M', 'Anagnou NP', 'Tubb J', 'Emery DW']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, F.O.R.T.H., Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Globins/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*therapy', 'Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2005/06/10 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['3302566 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gt.3302566 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2005 Nov;12(21):1591-600. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302566.,,"['HL53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL66947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL75713/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Some tumor-associated Ags elicit specific CD8 T cells in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here, we characterized ex vivo responses of CD8 T cells from CML patients to extrajunction bcr-abl peptides and telomerase 540-548 hTert, PR1, and WT1 peptides. CML-specific CD8 T cells were present in most treated patients and were usually multiepitopic: WT1, hTert, PR1, and bcr74 tetramer(+) cells were detected in 85, 82, 67, and 61% of patients, respectively. The breadth and magnitude of these responses did not differ significantly according to treatment or disease status. CML-specific tetramer(+) CD8 T cells had a predominantly memory phenotype, an intermediate perforin content, and low intracellular IFN-gamma accumulation in the presence of the relevant peptide. However, in short-term culture with HLA-matched leukemia cells, the patients' memory T cells were specifically reactivated to become IFN-gamma-producing effector cells, suggesting that CD8 T cell precursors with lytic potential are present in vivo and can be activated by appropriate stimulation. In conclusion, this study shows that multiepitopic tumor-specific CD8 T cell responses occur naturally in most CML patients, opening the way to new strategies for enhancing anti-CML immunity, in particular in patients with minimal residual disease.","['Gannage, Monique', 'Abel, Michal', 'Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Delluc, Stephanie', 'Lambert, Marion', 'Giraudier, Stephane', 'Kratzer, Roland', 'Niedermann, Gabriele', 'Saveanu, Loredana', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Camoin, Luc', 'Varet, Bruno', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Caillat-Zucman, Sophie']","['Gannage M', 'Abel M', 'Michallet AS', 'Delluc S', 'Lambert M', 'Giraudier S', 'Kratzer R', 'Niedermann G', 'Saveanu L', 'Guilhot F', 'Camoin L', 'Varet B', 'Buzyn A', 'Caillat-Zucman S']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Equipe Avenir, Unite 561, Hopital St-Vincent de Paul, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Myeloblastin', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/immunology/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Telomerase/immunology/metabolism', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology/metabolism']",2005/06/10 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/12/8210 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.12.8210 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Jun 15;174(12):8210-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.12.8210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the majority of B cell malignancies express the CD20 Ag, only approximately 50% of patients will respond to single-agent rituximab. The available data suggest that a decreased CD20 expression could account for the lack of response observed in some patients treated with rituximab. Despite the potential critical role of CD20 in the biology of B cell malignancies, the mechanisms controlling its expression are poorly understood. We evaluated the effect of the immune modulator agent bryostatin-1 on the expression of CD20 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. Using the B cell lines, DB and RAMOS, as well as tumor cells derived from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, we demonstrated that bryostatin-1 enhanced the expression of both CD20 mRNA and protein. The enhanced expression of CD20 was associated with increased transcriptional activity of the CD20 gene, whereas the stability of CD20 mRNA was not affected. The effect of bryostatin-1 on CD20 expression in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells was mediated through the MAPK kinase/ERK signal transduction pathway and involved protein kinase C, but was independent of p38 MAPK and was insensitive to dexamethasone. Cells pretreated with bryostatin-1 were more susceptible to the proapoptotic effect of anti-CD20 Ab. Overall, these data demonstrate for the first time that ERK phosphorylation is required for the up-regulated expression of CD20 on B cell malignancies. The findings also suggest that bryostatin-1 and rituximab could be a valuable combined therapy for B cell malignancies.","['Wojciechowski, Wojciech', 'Li, Huifen', 'Marshall, Shannon', ""Dell'Agnola, Chiara"", 'Espinoza-Delgado, Igor']","['Wojciechowski W', 'Li H', 'Marshall S', ""Dell'Agnola C"", 'Espinoza-Delgado I']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Gerontology Research Center, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",2005/06/10 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/12/7859 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.12.7859 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Jun 15;174(12):7859-68. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.12.7859.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies of mutant mice implicate various transcription factors in spleen development, but the hierarchical relationships between these factors have not been explored. In this report, we establish a genetic network that regulates spleen ontogeny, by analyzing asplenic mice mutant for the transcription factors Pbx1, Hox11 (Tlx1), Nkx3.2 (Bapx1) and Pod1 (capsulin, Tcf21). We show that Hox11 and Nkx2.5, among the earliest known markers for splenic progenitor cells, are absent in the splenic anlage of Pbx1 homozygous mutant (-/-) embryos, implicating the TALE homeoprotein Pbx1 in splenic cell specification. Pbx1 and Hox11 genetically interact in spleen formation and loss of either is associated with a similar reduction of progenitor cell proliferation and failed expansion of the splenic anlage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that Pbx1 binds to the Hox11 promoter in spleen mesenchymal cells, which co-express Pbx1 and Hox11. Furthermore, Hox11 binds its own promoter in vivo and acts synergistically with TALE proteins to activate transcription, supporting its role in an auto-regulatory circuit. These studies establish a Pbx1-Hox11-dependent genetic and transcriptional pathway in spleen ontogeny. Additionally, we demonstrate that while Nkx3.2 and Pod1 control spleen development via separate pathways, Pbx1 genetically regulates key players in both pathways, and thus emerges as a central hierarchical co-regulator in spleen genesis.","['Brendolan, Andrea', 'Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Salsi, Valentina', 'Moses, Kelvin', 'Quaggin, Susan', 'Blasi, Francesco', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Selleri, Licia']","['Brendolan A', 'Ferretti E', 'Salsi V', 'Moses K', 'Quaggin S', 'Blasi F', 'Cleary ML', 'Selleri L']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Cornell University, Weill Medical School, New York, NY, 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Tcf21 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Spleen/abnormalities/*embryology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",2005/06/10 09:00,2005/09/09 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['132/13/3113 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.01884 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2005 Jul;132(13):3113-26. doi: 10.1242/dev.01884.,,"['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD43997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Development. 2005 Aug;132(15):3575'],,,,,,,,,

However, physical activity levels of cancer survivors are generally low. This study adopted a qualitative approach to increase understanding of the lived experience of exercise for cancer survivors. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with six female cancer survivors who had taken part in the 2003 Race for Life fundraising event for Cancer Research UK. Following verbatim transcription of interviews, data reduction was carried out using Van Manen's method of thematic content analysis. Assimilation of central themes forms the basis of the final report. The essence of cancer survivors' experience of exercise was determined as 'going forward'-to move on, physically and mentally following treatment, to rebuild social networks, and to restore a positive, confident outlook towards the future. The central theme of 'going forward' was identified in aspects of participants' physical and mental recovery, and their future intentions for exercise. Race for Life represented a positive focus for participants after cancer treatment, and proved to be an appropriate starting point for initiating, or returning to exercise following cancer.

Cell extracts were analysed by SDS-PAGE and western immunoblotting using specific antibodies. An immunospecific band of molecular mass 36 kDa (catalytic subunit) was detected for PP1. For PP2A, two immunospecific bands of 32 kDa (proteolytically cleaved catalytic subunit) and 36 kDa (catalytic subunit) were observed. Comparisons of proliferating and differentiating cells using only one time point showed no significant differences between mean values for the expression of the PP1 or PP2A enzyme proteins. This kind of analysis, implying that HMBA had little effect, proved misleading, as comparisons using multiple time points showed rhythmic patterns of protein expression which were modulated by the differentiating agent. The effects were complex affecting both the frequency and phasing of rhythms. The results add further support for the view that live cells are multi-oscillators and for the concept that differentiation depends on changes in temporal organization of complex autodynamic feedback loops and multiple interactions between control circuits performing in parallel. In particular, modulation of the dynamics of key proteins, such as PP1 and PP2A, may be a possible mechanism for controlling cellular function and reversing transformation in accordance with long standing theoretical and other experimental data.","['Bodalina, U M', 'Hammond, K D', 'Gilbert, D A']","['Bodalina UM', 'Hammond KD', 'Gilbert DA']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Haematology, Medical School, University of the Witwatersrand, York Road, Parktown, Johannesburg, 2193, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Acetamides)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Periodicity', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/10 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2004/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1065-6995(05)00022-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2005.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2005 Apr;29(4):287-99. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2005.01.003.

It inhibits infectivitiy of a wide variety of retroviruses by deaminating deoxycytidine (dC) into deoxyuridine (dU) in newly synthesized minus strand DNA, resulting in G-to-A hypermutation of the viral plus strand DNA. To clarify the mechanism of its function, we have examined the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G on human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the first identified human retrovirus. RESULTS: In this study, we have demonstrated that overexpressed as well as endogenous APOBEC3G were incorporated into HTLV-1 virions and that APOBEC3G inhibited the infection of HTLV-1. Interestingly, several inactive mutants of APOBEC3G also inhibited HTLV-1 and no G-to-A hypermutation was induced by APOBEC3G in HTLV-1 genome. Furthermore, we introduced the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vif gene into HTLV-1 producing cell line, MT-2, to antagonize APOBEC3G by reducing its intracellular expression and virion incorporation, which resulted in upregulation of the infectivity of produced viruses. CONCLUSION: APOBEC3G is incorporated into HTLV-1 virions and inhibits the infection of HTLV-1 without exerting its cytidine deaminase activity. These results suggest that APOBEC3G might act on HTLV-1 through different mechanisms from that on HIV-1 and contribute to the unique features of HTLV-1 infection and transmission.","['Sasada, Amane', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Shirakawa, Kotaro', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki', 'Abudu, Aierkin', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Imada, Kazunori', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Sasada A', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Shirakawa K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Abudu A', 'Hishizawa M', 'Imada K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan. amasasa@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Gene Products, vif/metabolism', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2005/06/10 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-32 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-32 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 May 19;2:32. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-32.,,,20050519,['Retrovirology. 2005;2:37.

Activation of T lymphocytes is required for effective retroviral integration into the host cell genome and subsequent viral replication, but the molecular mechanisms involved in HTLV-1-mediated T cell activation remain unclear. HTLV-1 encodes various accessory proteins such as p12I, which has been demonstrated to be critical for HTLV-1 infectivity in vivo in rabbits and in vitro in quiescent primary human T lymphocytes. This hydrophobic protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum, increases intracellular calcium, and activates nuclear factor of activated T cell-mediated transcription. To further elucidate the role of p12I in regulation of cellular gene expression, we performed gene array analysis on stable p12I-expressing Jurkat T cells, using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Our data indicate that p12I altered the expression of genes associated with a network of interrelated pathways including T cell signaling, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Expression of several calcium-regulated genes was found to be altered by p12I, consistent with known properties of the viral protein. Gene array findings were confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR in Jurkat T cells and primary CD4+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, dose-dependent expression of p12I in Jurkat T cells resulted in significant increases in p300 and p300-dependent transcription. This is the first report of a viral protein influencing the transcription of p300, a rate-limiting coadapter critical in HTLV-1-mediated T cell activation. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that HTLV-1 p12I modulates cellular gene expression patterns to hasten the activation of T lymphocytes and thereby promote efficient viral infection.","['Nair, Amrithraj', 'Michael, Bindhu', 'Hiraragi, Hajime', 'Fernandez, Soledad', 'Feuer, Gerold', 'Boris-Lawrie, Kathleen', 'Lairmore, Michael']","['Nair A', 'Michael B', 'Hiraragi H', 'Fernandez S', 'Feuer G', 'Boris-Lawrie K', 'Lairmore M']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*virology', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",2005/06/10 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.2005.21.273 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2005 Apr;21(4):273-84. doi: 10.1089/aid.2005.21.273.,,"['CA-70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-069003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2668121,,['NIHMS94122'],,,,,,

Consistent with earlier results with polyamine analogues, these studies underscore the importance of charge in the design of polyamine-vectored chelators. Four polyamine conjugates are synthesized, two of terephthalic acid [N(1)-(4-carboxy)benzoylspermine (7) and its methyl ester (6)] and two of (S)-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-thiazolecarboxylic acid [(S)-4'-(HO)-DADFT] [(S)-4,5-dihydro-2-[2-hydroxy-4-(12-amino-5,9-diazadodecyl-oxy)phenyl]-4-methyl-4 -thiazolecarboxylic acid (10) and its ethyl ester (9)]. These four molecules were evaluated in murine leukemia L1210 cells for their impact on cell proliferation (48- and 96-h IC(50) values), their ability to compete with spermidine for the polyamine transport apparatus (K(i)), and their intracellular accumulation. The data revealed that when neutral molecules (cargo fragments) were fixed to the polyamine vector, the conjugates competed well with spermidine for transport and were accumulated intracellularly to millimolar levels. However, this was not the case when the cargo fragments were negatively charged. Metabolic studies of the polyamine-vectored (S)-4'-(HO)-DADFTs in rodents indicated that not only did the expected deaminopropylation step occur, but also a surprisingly high level of oxidative deamination at the terminal primary nitrogens took place. Finally, the iron-clearing efficiency of the (S)-4'-(HO)-DADFT conjugates was determined in a bile-duct-cannulated rodent model. Attaching the ligand to a polyamine vector had a profound effect on increasing the iron-clearing efficiency of this chelator relative to its parent drug.","['Bergeron, Raymond J', 'Bharti, Neelam', 'Wiegand, Jan', 'McManis, James S', 'Yao, Hua', 'Prokai, Laszlo']","['Bergeron RJ', 'Bharti N', 'Wiegand J', 'McManis JS', 'Yao H', 'Prokai L']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, 32610-0485, USA. bergeron@mc.cop.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0', '(4,5-dihydro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-(12-amino-5,9-diazadodecyloxy)phenyl)-4-methyl-4-thia', 'zolecarboxylic acid)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (N(1)-(4-carboxy)benzoylspermine)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electricity', 'Esters/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Spermidine/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Spermine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics']",2005/06/10 09:00,2005/07/07 09:00,['2005/06/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm048974f [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2005 Jun 16;48(12):4120-37. doi: 10.1021/jm048974f.,,['R01-DK49108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This characteristic karyotypic pattern, the most common in pediatric ALL, may arise via a tetraploid state with subsequent loss of chromosomes, by sequential gains of chromosomes in consecutive cell divisions, or by simultaneous gain of chromosomes in a single mitosis. These alternatives may be distinguished by investigation of the allelic ratios of loci on the tetrasomic and disomic chromosomes. Previous studies of tetrasomy 21 and of the occurrence of uniparental disomies (UPDs) have suggested that the most likely mechanism is simultaneous gain. However, the other pathways have not been definitely excluded because complete analyses of all disomies and tetrasomies have never been performed. In the present study, we investigated 27 hyperdiploid ALLs by using 58 polymorphic microsatellite markers mapped to 23 of the 24 human chromosomes. Twenty-six tetrasomies were analyzed (involving chromosomes X, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 21), and the frequency of UPDs was determined in 10 cases. In total, 200 chromosomes were studied. Equal allele dosage was observed in 24 of 26 tetrasomies, and only 7 UPDs were found. These data strongly suggest that hyperdiploidy in childhood ALL generally arises by a simultaneous gain of all additional chromosomes in a single abnormal mitosis.","['Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Morse, Helena', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Strombeck, Bodil', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Paulsson K', 'Morse H', 'Fioretos T', 'Behrendtz M', 'Strombeck B', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. kajsa.paulsson@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Cell Division', 'Child', '*Diploidy', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20222 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Oct;44(2):113-22. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic successes of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide and STI-571 have proven the importance of oncogene-targeted therapies in cancer treatment, and underlie the usefulness of such interactions for effective and rational design of therapeutic approaches to combat malignant diseases. Consequently, discussions devoted to the clinical use of the above drugs, as well as to the molecular pathogeneses of the diseases in which these drugs are effective, occupied a considerable part of the congress.

Some of his research associates and technicians and other healthy individuals also yielded such killer lymphocytes. The team considered pre-immunization to cancer occurring in individuals after in-family or professional exposure to patients with cancer (in an era when the concept of viral etiology of cancer was receiving major support); or that lymphocytes can acquire through blastic transformation immune reactivity to allogeneic cells anew in vitro. The phenomenon was eventually referred to as 'lymphocytes practicing Burnet's immunosurveillance.' Project site visitors of the USA NCI first viewed these observations as a matter of 'in vitro artifacts' being in opposition to strong tumor- specific cytotoxicity of tumor-bearing patients' lymphocytes recognized in the vast majority of other assays. After NCI funds were released for intramural studies on the phenomenon of non-specific cytotoxicity by lymphocytes, recipients (other than the senior author) of these NCI funds later characterized (1973-1975) the 'indiscriminately' cytotoxic lymphocyte populations as those of 'natural killer (NK) cells.' In this article, the original observations made in 1969-1971 are reviewed based on genuine material preserved by the senior author and are explained in view of recent discoveries that were not available at the time of the original observations. NK cells display a fascinating history arising first in urochordates during the cambrian explosion. At that level, NK cells protected their hosts from incompatible cell colony fusions and against intracellular, especially viral, pathogens. Since then, viruses evolved evasive maneuvers to escape NK cell attack on the infected cells. NK cells persisted after the evolution of adaptive immunity in cartilaginous fish fitting seamlessly into the new system. In mammals, NK cells assumed the role of chief arbitrators between the fetal trophoblast and maternal immune reactions to the semi-allograft fetus. Tumors induce in NK cells the same (inactivating; mediating Th2-type immunity) reactions the fetal trophoblast engenders in utero, but NK cells may overcome the host's tolerance to its tumor and kill tumor cells, especially when converted into lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells by molecular mediators of Th1-type immunity. The authors prepare and utilize LAK cells and IL-2 for adoptive immunotherapy of patients with metastatic melanoma and kidney carcinoma. A patient with malignant ascites due to ovarian carcinoma entered remission on LAK cell therapy. Just as dendritic cells, the major antigen presentors, may undergo malignant transformation, NK cells are also subject to transformation into FasL-producer virulent lymphoma-leukemia cells. The senior author reported in 1970 a patient with 'lymphosarcoma cell leukemia' whose circulating lymphoma cells killed indiscriminately human sarcoma and carcinoma cells. The exemplary case history of another patient with NK cell lymphoma-leukemia treated by the authors is presented.","['Sinkovics, Joseph G', 'Horvath, Joseph C']","['Sinkovics JG', 'Horvath JC']","[""Cancer Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital, Tampa, FL 33607-6387, USA. sinkovi.joseph@baycare.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/cytology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy/virology', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Jul;27(1):5-47.,585,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doxorubicin is a well-known bioreductive antitumour drug. Its ability to undergo a one-electron reduction by cellular oxidoreductases is related to the formation of an unstable semiquionone radical and followed by the production of reactive oxygen species. There is an increasing body of evidence that the activation of bioreductive drugs could result in the alkylation or crosslinking binding of DNA and lead to the significant increase in the cytotoxic activity against tumour cells. The aim of this study was to examine the role of reductive activation of DOX by the human liver NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) in increasing its cytotoxic activity especially in regard to MDR tumour cells. It has been evidenced that, upon CPR catalysis, DOX underwent only the redox cycling (at low NADPH concentration) or a multistage chemical transformation (at high NADPH concentration). It was also found, using superoxide dismutase (SOD), that the first stage undergoing reductive activation according to the mechanism of the redox cycling had the key importance for the metabolic conversion of DOX. In the second part of this work, the ability of DOX to inhibit the growth of human promyelocytic-sensitive leukaemia HL60 cell line as well as its MDR sublines exhibiting two different phenotypes of MDR related to the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (HL60/VINC) or MRP1 (HL60/DOX) was studied in the presence of exogenously added CPR. Our assays showed that the presence of CPR catalysing only the redox cycling of DOX had no effect in increasing its cytotoxicity against sensitive and MDR tumour cells. In contrast, an important increase in cytotoxic activity of DOX after its reductive conversion by CPR was observed against HL60 as well as HL60/VINC and HL60/DOX cells.","['Kostrzewa-Nowak, D', 'Paine, M J I', 'Wolf, C R', 'Tarasiuk, J']","['Kostrzewa-Nowak D', 'Paine MJ', 'Wolf CR', 'Tarasiuk J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Szczecin, 3a Felczaka St, 71-412 Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Spectrophotometry']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602639 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602639 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 Jul 11;93(1):89-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602639.,,,,,,PMC2361480,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To define the clinical spectrum and impact of RSV pneumonitis on hospitalized, immunocompromised adults. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. Clinical parameters including premorbid conditions, presentation, radiologic findings, treatment and outcome were examined in a consecutive patients series from an inpatient tertiary-care center. Eleven immunocompromised adults who had undergone bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) between January 1987 and December 1996 and who had culture-verified RSV pneumonitis were evaluated. RESULTS: This series consisted primarily of patients undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation for lymphoma or leukemia. Two were immunosuppressed due to high-dose corticosteroids. A majority (91%) were admitted between November and May, with dyspnea and productive cough. In contrast to earlier studies, there was a paucity of upper respiratory infection symptoms (i.e. sinus congestion, sore throat) and a preponderance of lower respiratory physical exam findings (i.e. wheezing, bibasilar rales). Patients were typically hypoxemic and febrile prior to BAL. Eight demonstrated co-isolates of bacterial or fungi on BAL. The chest radiographs generally revealed diffuse patchy infiltrates, including alveolar opacities. Histology demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage, bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia, and hyaline membrane formation. Over half required intubation, and 55% died. Although ribavirin therapy may be beneficial in some intubated patients, its overall efficacy cannot be established from this series. CONCLUSION: RSV is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised adults. Further development and implementation of an effective vaccine and additional therapeutic interventions are needed.","['Ebbert, Jon O', 'Limper, Andrew H']","['Ebbert JO', 'Limper AH']","['Division of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Respiration,Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,0137356,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/isolation & purification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ribavirin/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2002/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['85367 [pii]', '10.1159/000085367 [doi]']",ppublish,Respiration. 2005 May-Jun;72(3):263-9. doi: 10.1159/000085367.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized vincristine-selected human leukemia cells to establish whether development of vincristine resistance was accompanied by changes in cell cycle kinetics and distribution. Our results indicate that vincristine resistance is accompanied by delayed G2 transit and prolonged early mitosis in both the absence and the presence of the microtubule binder nocodazole. The altered G2/M regulation is accompanied by resistance to short-term (12 h) but not continuous nocodazole exposure in agreement with the transient nature of the observed cell cycle alterations. Western blot analysis indicates that vincristine-selection is accompanied by down-regulation of topoisomerase IIalpha without detectable alterations of the other mitotic regulators studied, including Cdk1, p21, 14-3-3sigma, and 14-3-3epsilon. This was associated with at least 7-fold less chromosome-associated topoisomerase IIalpha, decreased catalytic activity, and cross-resistance to topoisomerase II inhibitors.

We report a correlation between abnormally high levels of elastase in the blood of AML patients and the number of leukemic blast cells in the circulation. In AML cells, we observed expression of cell-surface elastase, which was regulated by the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). In vitro inhibition of elastase prevented SDF-1-induced cell polarization, podia formation, and reduced migration of human AML cells as well as their adhesion. Elastase inhibition also significantly impaired in vivo homing of most human AML cells to the bone marrow (BM) of nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID)/beta-2 microglobulin knock-out (B2m null) mice that underwent transplantation. Moreover, in vitro proliferation of AML cells was elastase dependent.

We investigated the role of the regulatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in this paradox in well-established murine models of aGVHD and cGVHD wherein recipients undergo transplantation with splenocytes from donors treated with G-CSF. Neutralization of TGF-beta after stem-cell transplantation (SCT) significantly increased the severity of aGVHD, and the concurrent prevention of interleukin-10 (IL-10) production further exaggerated this effect. Early after SCT, donor T cells were the predominant source of TGF-beta and were able to attenuate aGVHD in a TGF-beta-dependent fashion. Although the neutralization of TGF-beta augmented the proliferation and expansion of donor T cells after SCT, it paradoxically impaired cellular cytotoxicity to host antigens and associated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. In cGVHD, neutralization of TGF-beta from day 14 after SCT attenuated histologic abnormalities, and CD11b+ mononuclear cells infiltrating sclerodermatous skin produced 50-fold more TGF-beta than corresponding T cells. Thus, though the production of TGF-beta by donor T cells early after transplantation attenuates aGVHD and is required for optimal GVL, the production of TGF-beta late after SCT is preferentially from mononuclear cells and mediates cGVHD. These data have important implications for the timing of therapeutic TGF-beta neutralization to prevent cGVHD after allogeneic SCT.","['Banovic, Tatjana', 'MacDonald, Kelli P A', 'Morris, Edward S', 'Rowe, Vanessa', 'Kuns, Rachel', 'Don, Alistair', 'Kelly, Jane', 'Ledbetter, Steve', 'Clouston, Andrew D', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Banovic T', 'MacDonald KP', 'Morris ES', 'Rowe V', 'Kuns R', 'Don A', 'Kelly J', 'Ledbetter S', 'Clouston AD', 'Hill GR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, 300 Herston Rd, Herston, QLD 4006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/complications/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/10/12 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63451-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-01-0062 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 15;106(6):2206-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0062.

To understand its role in cell type specification, we determined the human genomic binding sites of MLL1. We found that MLL1 functions as a human equivalent of yeast Set1. Like Set1, MLL1 localizes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the 5' end of actively transcribed genes, where histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation occurs. Consistent with this global role in transcription, MLL1 also localizes to microRNA (miRNA) loci that are involved in leukemia and hematopoiesis. In contrast to the 5' proximal binding behavior at most protein-coding genes, MLL1 occupies an extensive domain within a transcriptionally active region of the HoxA cluster. The ability of MLL1 to serve as a start site-specific global transcriptional regulator and to participate in larger chromatin domains at the Hox genes reveals dual roles for MLL1 in maintenance of cellular identity.","['Guenther, Matthew G', 'Jenner, Richard G', 'Chevalier, Brett', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Canaani, Eli', 'Young, Richard A']","['Guenther MG', 'Jenner RG', 'Chevalier B', 'Nakamura T', 'Croce CM', 'Canaani E', 'Young RA']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 9 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics', 'Genes, Regulator/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Genomics/methods', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['0503072102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0503072102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Jun 14;102(24):8603-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0503072102.

A human cell line, K562, that can be chemically induced to differentiate into various hematopoietic lineages was chosen as a model system for this study. Several K562 cell lines with constitutive and conditional expression of CTCF have been generated. By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients were included of which 16 had a complete follow up. They underwent an echocardiography before chemotherapy, 1-3 months and 3.5+/-0.6 years after the treatment. We recorded pulsed TDI at the mitral annulus, the basal segments of the left ventricular (LV) lateral and posterior walls; peak velocities in systole (Sm), early (Em) and late diastole and the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) were measured. The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 211+/-82 g/m2. Early after anthracycline therapy, we observed changes in the diastolic LV function with a decrease of the mitral E peak velocity and TDI Em. At the late control, diastolic changes were more pronounced and associated with an alteration of the systolic function (LV ejection fraction and Sm). Four patients had a LV ejection fraction <50%; in these patients we observed a mitral annulus IVRT <80 ms at the early control; this could be of interest to predict later impairment of the LV ejection fraction. CONCLUSION: We found early changes in LV diastolic function and observed that late impairment of the LV ejection fraction occurred frequently after anthracycline therapy, despite normal systolic LV function during the first months of follow-up.","['Tassan-Mangina, Sophie', 'Codorean, Daniela', 'Metivier, Marie', 'Costa, Brigitte', 'Himberlin, Chantal', 'Jouannaud, Christelle', 'Blaise, Anne Marie', 'Elaerts, Jacques', 'Nazeyrollas, Pierre']","['Tassan-Mangina S', 'Codorean D', 'Metivier M', 'Costa B', 'Himberlin C', 'Jouannaud C', 'Blaise AM', 'Elaerts J', 'Nazeyrollas P']","['Cardiology Department, CHU Reims, France. stassanmangina@chu-reims.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Echocardiogr,European journal of echocardiography : the journal of the Working Group on Echocardiography of the European Society of Cardiology,100890618,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Echocardiography/*methods', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging']",2005/06/09 09:00,2006/07/14 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-2167(05)00069-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.euje.2005.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Echocardiogr. 2006 Mar;7(2):141-6. doi: 10.1016/j.euje.2005.04.009.

These interactions are often evaluated in cell-cell fusion, gene-reporting systems with effector cells expressing Env and target cells expressing receptors. A common system utilizes vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) in effector cells and a T7 promoted reporter plasmid in target cells. Fusion is quantified with expression of the reporter plasmid. However, direct activation of reporter plasmid from vaccinia virus can occur increasing background activity. We report here a modification of this assay in which T7 RNAP is expressed from a plasmid rather than vaccinia. This modification increased sensitivity with a ten-fold reduction in background. A novel dual T7/SP6 RNAP fusion assay was also developed to allow rapid screening for functional Env clones. Using these assays, we show that Envs from two CD4-independent HIV-2 isolates (VCP and ROD/B), which are able to fuse with chemokine receptor CXCR4 in a CD4-independent manner, are also able to fuse with alternative coreceptors GPR1 and GPR15 in the absence of CD4.

RESULTS: There was no difference between the killing effect of normal cells and that of colon cancer cells by using the high dosage of ricin (5 x 10(-8) mol/L approximately 5 x 10(-10) mol/L). However, the cytotoxicity was significant different in those cells with the low dosage of ricin (5 x 10(-11) mol/L approximately 5 x 10(-13) mol/L). Meanwhile ricin had the similar cytotoxicity to leukemia cell K562 and colon cancer cell SW480. CONCLUSION: Ricin is able to kill tumor cells selectively at low concentration, but the selectivity does not appear at high concentrations.","['Zou, Li-bo', 'Zhan, Jin-biao']","['Zou LB', 'Zhan JB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Myeloid leukemia patients given a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for example, benefit from KIR-mediated NK alloreactivity directed against the leukemia cells. To establish an effective NK cell repertoire, most KIR genes are expressed stochastically, independently of the others. However, the sequences upstream of the coding regions of these KIR genes are highly homologous to the recently identified KIR3DL1 promoter (91.1-99.6% sequence identity), suggesting that they are regulated by similar if not identical mechanisms of transcriptional activation. We investigated the effects of small sequence differences between the KIR3DL1 promoter and other KIR promoters on transcription factor binding and promoter activity. Surprisingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and promoter-reporter assays revealed significant structural and functional differences in the cis-acting elements of these highly homologous KIR promoters, suggesting a key role for transcription factors in independent control of expression of specific KIR loci. Thus, the KIR repertoire may be shaped by a combination of both gene-specific and stochastic mechanisms.","['van Bergen, Jeroen', 'Stewart, C Andrew', 'van den Elsen, Peter J', 'Trowsdale, John']","['van Bergen J', 'Stewart CA', 'van den Elsen PJ', 'Trowsdale J']","['Department of Pathology, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.

Previous studies have also shown that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (interleukin [IL]-6) contributes to survival signals in an autocrine fashion and that myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic member of the B-cell leukemia-2 family, is an important participant in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance in this neoplasm. The present study evaluated the possibility that IL-6 signaling contributes to Mcl-1 up-regulation in cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: Protein kinase B (Akt) and Mcl-1 expression in human tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between IL-6 signaling, Akt activity, and Mcl-1 expression was examined in cell lines. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that the serine/threonine kinase Akt and Mcl-1 are strongly expressed in the preneoplastic bile duct inflammatory disease primary sclerosing cholangitis and in human cholangiocarcinoma specimens. Immunoblotting showed that Akt is expressed and constitutively phosphorylated in 3 human cholangiocarcinoma lines. Further analysis showed that treatment with anti-IL-6-neutralizing antiserum led to reduced Akt phosphorylation, diminished Mcl-1 expression, and enhanced TRAIL sensitivity. Likewise, the Akt inhibitor A443654.3 led to diminished signaling through the Akt pathway, decreased Mcl-1 expression, and enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings not only show that an autocrine IL-6/Akt signaling pathway enhances Mcl-1 expression in cholangiocarcinoma but also suggest a strategy for overcoming the resulting apoptosis resistance.","['Kobayashi, Shogo', 'Werneburg, Nathan W', 'Bronk, Steven F', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Kobayashi S', 'Werneburg NW', 'Bronk SF', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Gores GJ']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0016508505003835 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2005.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2005 Jun;128(7):2054-65. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.03.010.,,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 69009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 59427/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Elimination of cells with UV-induced DNA damage via apoptosis provides a powerful mechanism to minimize retention or expansion of genetically abnormal cells. This cell editing function has largely been ascribed to the biological role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as mutations or deletions involving p53 have been linked to skin cancer development. Rather than introducing mutations, or using cells with complete loss of wild-type p53, we used an siRNA-based approach to knockdown, but not eliminate, p53 levels in primary cultures of human KCs followed by UV-irradiation. Surprisingly, when p53 levels were reduced by 50-80% the apoptosis induced by exposure to UV-light was accelerated and markedly enhanced (two- to three- fold) compared to control siRNA treated KCs. The p53 siRNA treated KCs were characterized by elevated E2F-1 levels accompanied by accelerated elimination of the Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) antiapoptotic proteins, as well as enhanced Bax oligomerization. Forced overexpression of either Mcl-1 or Bcl-x(L) reduced the UV-light enhanced apoptotic response in p53 siRNA treated KCs. We conclude that p53 not only can provide proapoptotic signals but also regulates a survival pathway influencing Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) levels. This overlooked survival function of p53 may explain previous paradoxical responses noted by investigators using p53 heterozygous and knockout mouse models, and opens up the possibility that not all liaisons within the cell involving p53 necessarily represent fatal attractions.","['Chaturvedi, Vijaya', 'Sitailo, Leonid A', 'Qin, Jian-Zhong', 'Bodner, Barbara', 'Denning, Mitchell F', 'Curry, Jonathan', 'Zhang, Wengeng', 'Brash, Douglas', 'Nickoloff, Brian J']","['Chaturvedi V', 'Sitailo LA', 'Qin JZ', 'Bodner B', 'Denning MF', 'Curry J', 'Zhang W', 'Brash D', 'Nickoloff BJ']","['Department of Pathology, Oncology Institute, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208650 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208650 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Aug 11;24(34):5299-312. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208650.,,"['AR 47307/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 47814/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PML localizes to discrete nuclear bodies (NBs) that are disrupted in APL cells, resulting from a reciprocal chromosome translocation t (15;17). Here we show that the nuclear localization of PML is also regulated by SUMO-3, one of the three recently identified SUMO isoforms in human cells. SUMO-3 bears similar subcellular distribution to those of SUMO-1 and -2 in the interphase nuclear body, which is colocalized with PML protein. However, both SUMO-2 and -3 are also localized to nucleoli, a region lacking SUMO-1. Immunoprecipitated PML protein bears SUMO-3 moiety in a covalently modified form, supporting the notion that PML is conjugated by SUMO-3. To determine the functional relevance of SUMO-3 conjugation on PML molecular dynamics, we suppressed SUMO-3 protein expression using a siRNA-mediated approach. Depletion of SUMO-3 markedly reduced the number of PML-containing NBa and their integrity, which is rescued by exogenous expression of SUMO-3 but not SUMO-1 or SUMO-2. The specific requirement of SUMO-3 for PML nuclear localization is validated by expression of SUMO-3 conjugation defective mutant. Moreover, we demonstrate that oligomerization of SUMO-3 is required for PML retention in the nucleus. Taken together, our studies provide first line of evidence showing that SUMO-3 is essential for PML localization and offer novel insight into the pathobiochemistry of APL.","['Fu, Chuanhai', 'Ahmed, Kashif', 'Ding, Husheng', 'Ding, Xia', 'Lan, Jianping', 'Yang, Zhihong', 'Miao, Yong', 'Zhu, Yuanyuan', 'Shi, Yunyu', 'Zhu, Jingde', 'Huang, He', 'Yao, Xuebiao']","['Fu C', 'Ahmed K', 'Ding H', 'Ding X', 'Lan J', 'Yang Z', 'Miao Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Shi Y', 'Zhu J', 'Huang H', 'Yao X']","['School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'SUMO-1 Protein/chemistry/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208714 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208714 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Aug 18;24(35):5401-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208714.,,"['CA89019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56292/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein responsible for de novo synthesis and maintenance of telomeres, and its activity is predominantly observed in cancer cells. The telomerase enzyme has been successfully inhibited or inactivated to sensitize cells to cellular stresses; however, no studies have determined yet the effect of combining a pharmacological inhibitor of telomerase catalysis and traditional chemotherapeutics for the treatment of drug-sensitive or drug-resistant cancers. Here, we describe the effect of 2-[(E)-3-naphtalen-2-yl-but-2-enoylamino]-benzoic acid (BIBR1532), a small-molecule inhibitor of telomerase catalytic activity, on drug-resistant leukemia and breast cancer cells and their parental counterparts when treated in combination with chemotherapeutics. We observed that BIBR1532-treated cells show progressive telomere shortening, decreased proliferative capacity, and sensitization to chemotherapeutic treatment. These effects are telomere length-dependent, because cells insensitive to BIBR1532 or cells released from telomerase inhibition did not demonstrate changes in growth ability or drug sensitivity.

We previously showed that the BCR-ABL1 kinase that is expressed in pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia bypasses selection for pre-B cell receptor-dependent survival signals. Investigating possible interference of BCR-ABL1 with pre-B cell receptor signaling, we found that neither SYK nor SLP65 can be phosphorylated in response to pre-B cell receptor engagement. Instead, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is constitutively phosphorylated by BCR-ABL1. Activated BTK is essential for survival signals that otherwise would arise from the pre-B cell receptor, including activation of PLCgamma1, autonomous Ca2+ signaling, STAT5-phosphorylation, and up-regulation of BCLX(L). Inhibition of BTK activity specifically induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL1+ leukemia cells to a similar extent as inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity itself. However, BCR-ABL1 cannot directly bind to full-length BTK. Instead, BCR-ABL1 induces the expression of a truncated splice variant of BTK that acts as a linker between the two kinases. As opposed to full-length BTK, truncated BTK lacks kinase activity yet can bind to BCR-ABL1 through its SRC-homology domain 3. Acting as a linker, truncated BTK enables BCR-ABL1-dependent activation of full-length BTK, which initiates downstream survival signals and mimics a constitutively active pre-B cell receptor.","['Feldhahn, Niklas', 'Klein, Florian', 'Mooster, Jana L', 'Hadweh, Paul', 'Sprangers, Mieke', 'Wartenberg, Maria', 'Bekhite, Mohamed M', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Herzog, Sebastian', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Feldhahn N', 'Klein F', 'Mooster JL', 'Hadweh P', 'Sprangers M', 'Wartenberg M', 'Bekhite MM', 'Hofmann WK', 'Herzog S', 'Jumaa H', 'Rowley JD', 'Muschen M']","['Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pre-B Cell Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Mimicry', 'Pre-B Cell Receptors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/08/30 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20042101 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20042101 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2005 Jun 6;201(11):1837-52. doi: 10.1084/jem.20042101.,,,,,,PMC2213268,,,,,,,,

IFNbeta caused a reduction in the steady state level of c-Myc protein by increasing degradation through the 26S proteasome. Our data, as well as that of others, indicate that multiple levels of c-Myc expression can be affected by IFN treatment and this contributes to rapid growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.","['Hu, Xinrong', 'Bies, Juraj', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Hu X', 'Bies J', 'Wolff L']","['Leukemogenesis Section, Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00160-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Nov;29(11):1307-14. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This could serve as a cheap and easy diagnostic, avoiding more complicated measures. A database was build containing 624 patients suffering from either intra- and extrapulmonary disease. The flow-volume curve indices of restrictive patients (with a total lung capacity < -1.96 sd of reference) were compared and it was shown that in primary fibrotic disease and in leukaemia, indeed, the PEF and MEF(75/50/25) were significantly higher compared to the heart failure group (P < or = 0.001).

Although historically chemotherapy has had limited utility in treating this disease, therapeutic nihilism surrounding its use is no longer warranted, as demonstrated by results of 2 recent randomized clinical trials showing that docetaxel-based chemotherapy improves survival in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Although the survival benefit was a modest 2 months, the results hold the promise that docetaxel-based treatment in earlier-stage disease may provide a longer survival advantage. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 90203 and TAX 3501 studies are phase 3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant radical prostatectomy trials designed to assess the role of docetaxel in patients with high-risk localized disease. These 2 trials, along with the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 9921 trial, which will assess the potential for adjuvant mitoxantrone, are paving the way for earlier systemic treatment. The need for better therapies for patients routinely seen in the urology clinic and the potential for improvements with chemotherapy necessitate an increasing collaboration between urologists and oncologists. Referral to a medical oncologist for a full discussion of treatment options is in the best interest of patients with HRPC, and patients at high-risk for treatment failure should be encouraged to consider clinical trial enrollment.","['Kibel, Adam S']",['Kibel AS'],"['Division of Urologic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA. kibela@msnotes.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '35LT29625A (Estramustine)', 'A0Z3NAU9DP (bicalutamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Androgen Antagonists/administration & dosage', 'Anilides/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Docetaxel', 'Estramustine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Nitriles', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Tosyl Compounds']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0090-4295(05)00429-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2005.03.079 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2005 Jun;65(6 Suppl):13-8. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2005.03.079.,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To trace and quantitatively assess the differentiation of ES cells into gut endodermal cells, we used an ES cell line with the lacZ gene inserted into the pdx-1 locus. Targeted mutations of pdx-1 in mice demonstrate that pdx-1 is required for pancreatic and rostral duodenal development; therefore, pdx-1 serves as an excellent early gut regional specific marker. When these ES cells were differentiated by removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), only fractional cells turned into lacZ positive, which indicates pancreatic-duodenal differentiation. Co-cultivation of ES cells with pancreatic rudiments induced a significant increase in the proportion of lacZ positive cell numbers and this increase was further enhanced by forced expression of a chick putative endoderm inducer gene, cmix. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 mimicked the effects of pancreatic rudiments and this effect was enhanced by cmix expression. Expression analysis showed over-expression of cmix induced endodermal marker genes. These data indicate that one can make use of this knowledge on molecular events of embryonic development to drive ES cells to differentiate into pdx-1 expressing endodermal cells in vitro.","['Shiraki, Nobuaki', 'Lai, Cheng-Jung', 'Hishikari, Yosuke', 'Kume, Shoen']","['Shiraki N', 'Lai CJ', 'Hishikari Y', 'Kume S']","['Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CMIX protein, chicken)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Duodenum/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endoderm/cytology/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Microinjections', 'Models, Biological', 'Pancreas/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenopus']",2005/06/09 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/06/09 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['GTC854 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00854.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2005 Jun;10(6):503-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00854.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the frailties are unobserved, an E-M approach is often used for estimation. Such an approach is shown to lead to finite sample underestimation of the frailty variance, with the corresponding regression parameters also being underestimated as a result. For the univariate case, we investigate the source of the bias with simulation studies and a complete enumeration. The rank-based E-M approach, we note, only identifies frailty through the order in which failures occur; additional frailty which is evident in the survival times is ignored, and as a result the frailty variance is underestimated. An adaption of the standard E-M approach is suggested, whereby the non-parametric Breslow estimate is replaced by a local likelihood formulation for the baseline hazard which allows the survival times themselves to enter the model. Simulations demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces the bias, even at small sample sizes.

We, therefore, prospectively tested the efficacy of cytoreductive chemotherapy (intermediate-dose cytarabine+idarubicin+etoposide) followed immediately by G-CSF-primed DLI (Chemo-DLI) in 10 relapsed ALL patients after allogeneic BMT. Seven achieved complete remission (CR) at a median of 25 days (19-73 days) after DLI. Of these seven CR patients, only one remains alive in CR 907 days after DLI. Two CR patients died in CR of graft-versus-host disease. The remaining four CR patients relapsed at a median of 153 days (120-991 days) after DLI. One is alive with leukemia at post-DLI day 1217. The median survival duration after DLI was 175 days (15-1217 days). In summary, although Chemo-DLI for relapsed ALL after allogeneic BMT induced a relatively high CR rate, durable remissions were rare. Although our data should be interpreted cautiously considering the small number of patients, these results suggest that poor outcome of DLI in relapsed ALL may be primarily due to intrinsic resistance to graft-versus-leukemia effect rather than to the rapid pace of the disease.","['Choi, S-J', 'Lee, J-H', 'Lee, J-H', 'Kim, S', 'Lee, Y-S', 'Seol, M', 'Ryu, S-G', 'Lee, J-S', 'Kim, W-K', 'Jang, S', 'Park, C-J', 'Chi, H-S', 'Lee, K-H']","['Choi SJ', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Kim S', 'Lee YS', 'Seol M', 'Ryu SG', 'Lee JS', 'Kim WK', 'Jang S', 'Park CJ', 'Chi HS', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. sjchoi3@amc.seoul.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705024 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705024 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jul;36(2):163-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an oral rinse protocol, we studied neutrophil tissue delivery kinetics and its relationship to clinical parameters post-HSCT in 29 pediatric patients. Oral neutrophil counts were compared to circulating neutrophil levels, oral mucositis scores and infection-related febrile episodes after engraftment. Blood engraftment (BE) is currently defined by a blood neutrophil count of > or =0.5 x 10(9)/l. We defined oral engraftment (OE) as the day neutrophils returned in the mouth post-HSCT (> or =0.25 x 10(4)/ml oral neutrophils in the rinse sample). We found that neutrophils reappeared 6.3+/-3.9 s.d. days earlier in the mouth than in the circulation enabling us to identify successful engraftment almost 1 week sooner than using blood count values alone. Furthermore, the time-span between OE and BE was inversely related to the number of infection-related febrile episodes post-BE. We conclude that monitoring the timing of neutrophil tissue delivery through a rapid oral rinse may yield important insights into the biology of neutrophil recovery during and after engraftment and the factors associated with neutrophil tissue recruitment.","['Cheretakis, C', 'Dror, Y', 'Glogauer, M']","['Cheretakis C', 'Dror Y', 'Glogauer M']","['CIHR Group in Matrix Dynamics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Mouthwashes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/*methods', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mouth Mucosa/pathology', 'Mouthwashes', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705025 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705025 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Aug;36(3):227-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these patients with primary refractory AML, the only curative option remains an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Allogeneic transplantation provides the ability to administer myeloablative doses of chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, as well as the advantage of a possible graft-versus-leukemia effect. Difficulty in interpreting the literature is due to selection bias, in particular, the varying definitions of primary refractory disease with respect to the morphological criteria and the number of induction regimen required before being defined as being refractory. Regardless, it is a procedure with high treatment-related mortality and risk of relapse. Most studies demonstrate an event-free survival of 10-20% at 5 years. Predictive factors of outcome include blast cell count in the marrow, karyotype, the number of prior regimen, age, performance status and availability of a related donor. These prognostic factors should be considered prior to offering allogeneic transplantation for primary refractory AML. Those patients with many favorable prognostic factors and an HLA-matched related donor available would be the best candidate for the procedure. Those with many poor prognostic factors and only an unrelated donor available may be better served by being offered palliation or being enrolled in investigational studies.","['Song, K W', 'Lipton, J']","['Song KW', 'Lipton J']","['The Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program of British Columbia, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center, British Columbia Cancer Agency, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. ksong@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705038 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705038 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Aug;36(3):183-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705038.,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This promotes the polyubiquitylation and degradation of the pro-growth and pro-survival client proteins Bcr-Abl, mutant FLT-3, c-Raf, and AKT in human leukemia cells. HDAC6 is a member of the class IIB HDACs. It is predominantly cytosolic, microtubule-associated alpha-tubulin deacetylase that is also known to promote aggresome inclusion of the misfolded polyubiquitylated proteins. Here we demonstrate that in the Bcr-abl oncogene expressing human leukemia K562 cells, HDAC6 can be co-immunoprecipitated with HSP90, and the knock-down of HDAC6 by its siRNA induced the acetylation of HSP90 and alpha-tubulin. Depletion of HDAC6 levels also inhibited the binding of HSP90 to ATP, reduced the chaperone association of HSP90 with its client proteins, e.g. Bcr-Abl, and induced polyubiquitylation and partial depletion of Bcr-Abl. Conversely, the ectopic overexpression of HDAC6 inhibited LAQ824-induced acetylation of HSP90 and alpha-tubulin and reduced LAQ824-mediated depletion of Bcr-Abl, AKT, and c-Raf. Collectively, these findings indicate that HDAC6 is also an HSP90 deacetylase.

However, the receptors and effector mechanisms responsible for its broad tumoricidal function remain undefined. Here, we examined the roles played by natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR), killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, cytolytic granule components, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members in tumor recognition and lysis by TALL-104 cells. The perforin-granzyme pathway, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and Fas were each involved in the lysis of particular tumor targets by TALL-104. Furthermore, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin treatment induced surface expression of Fas-L and TRAIL. In addition, supernatants from CD3-stimulated TALL-104 cultures exhibited antiproliferative activity, which was blocked 50-90% by anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb). Although negative for the NCR natural killer (NK)p44, this cell line was found to express NKp46. An anti-NKp46 antibody strongly blocked TALL-104-mediated lysis of certain targets and directly induced cytokine production, granule release, and redirected lysis responses. Anti-NKG2D and anti-2B4 also stimulated redirected cytotoxicity by TALL-104. By contrast, anti-NKG2A mAb did not stain the cells or inhibit killing responses. Alternatively, KIR3DL2 was detected on TALL-104, and expression of its reported ligand, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, on target cells provided protection from cytotoxicity. Thus, NKp46, NKG2D, and 2B4 are activating receptors, and KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor on TALL-104. The data demonstrate the ability of TALL-104 cells to recognize a wide variety of tumors with NK cell receptors and kill them with a broad arsenal of cytolytic effector mechanisms, including cytolytic granules and TNF family ligands.","['Brando, Clara', 'Mukhopadhyay, Sunil', 'Kovacs, Eniko', 'Medina, Rosa', 'Patel, Pritesh', 'Catina, Tracey L', 'Campbell, Kerry S', 'Santoli, Daniela']","['Brando C', 'Mukhopadhyay S', 'Kovacs E', 'Medina R', 'Patel P', 'Catina TL', 'Campbell KS', 'Santoli D']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CD244 protein, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (KIR3DL2 protein, human)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL2)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (GEM protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/immunology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1', 'Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR3DL2', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/immunology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0604360 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0604360 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2005 Aug;78(2):359-71. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0604360.

Both receptors induce activation of the Stat family of signal transducers via the Jak/Stat pathway. Here, we aimed to establish whether activation of Stat3 in maternal endometrium is essential for successful implantation. Functional blockade of Stat3 before implantation, by injection into the uterine lumen of a cell-permeable Stat3 peptide inhibitor, reduced embryo implantation specifically by 70% (P < 0.001). Stat3 is phosphorylated in the luminal epithelium (LE) in response to LIF, and this phosphorylation was significantly reduced both in vitro and in vivo by the Stat3 inhibitor. The inhibitor also blocked induction by LIF of several LIF-regulated genes in the LE including Irg1, which has been shown previously to be essential for implantation. Successful implantation is therefore dependent on phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 in the endometrium before implantation. This finding provides a target for contraceptive development, based on selective blockade of signal transduction pathways essential for implantation. This study demonstrates that cell-permeable peptide inhibitors can be used effectively to target intracellular signaling pathways in the uterine LE.","['Catalano, Rob D', 'Johnson, Martin H', 'Campbell, Elizabeth A', 'Charnock-Jones, D Stephen', 'Smith, Stephen K', 'Sharkey, Andrew M']","['Catalano RD', 'Johnson MH', 'Campbell EA', 'Charnock-Jones DS', 'Smith SK', 'Sharkey AM']","['Reproductive Molecular Research Group, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1QP, United Kingdom. rc296@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Contraception/*methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['0502343102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0502343102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Jun 14;102(24):8585-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0502343102.

The authors examined whether the diseases' similar large-scale distributions are reflected in small geographic areas while also examining the influence of sociodemographic characteristics. Details of 299 children (0-14 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1,551 children with diabetes diagnosed between 1986 and 1998 were extracted from two registers in Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Standardized incidence ratios across 532 electoral wards were compared using Poisson regression, confirming significant associations between population mixing and the geographic heterogeneity of both conditions. Bayesian methods analysis of spatial correlation between diseases by modeling a bivariate outcome based on their standardized incidence ratios was applied; spatial and heterogeneity components were included within a hierarchical random effects model. A positive correlation between diseases of 0.33 (95% credible interval: -0.20, 0.74) was observed, and this was reduced after control for population mixing (r = 0.18), population density (r = 0.14), and deprivation (r = 0.06). The Bayesian approach showed a modest but nonsignificant joint spatial correlation between diseases, only partially suggesting that the risk of both was associated within some electoral wards. With Bayesian methodology, population mixing remained significantly associated with both diseases. The links between diabetes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia observed for large regions are weaker for small areas. More powerful replications are needed for confirmation of these findings.","['Feltbower, Richard G', 'Manda, Samuel O M', 'Gilthorpe, Mark S', 'Greaves, Mel F', 'Parslow, Roger C', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Bodansky, H Jonathan', 'McKinney, Patricia A']","['Feltbower RG', 'Manda SO', 'Gilthorpe MS', 'Greaves MF', 'Parslow RC', 'Kinsey SE', 'Bodansky HJ', 'McKinney PA']","['Pediatric Epidemiology Group, Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Leeds, 30 Hyde Terrace, Leeds LS2 9LN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['161/12/1168 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwi146 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2005 Jun 15;161(12):1168-80. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwi146.,,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 2005 Dec 1;162(11):1132-3.

Increase in Mcl-1 gene expression in chondrocytes induced by joint immobilization was confirmed by RT-PCR, Northern blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate that chondrocytes respond to the complete absence of joint motion by expressing Mcl-1 gene. This expression may be part of a defense strategy by chondrocytes to overcome the impending chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration induced by joint immobility.","['Trudel, G', 'Uhthoff, H', 'Laneuville, O']","['Trudel G', 'Uhthoff H', 'Laneuville O']","['Bone and Joint Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Immobilization/*methods', 'Knee Joint/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)01063-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.099 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Jul 22;333(1):247-52. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We restricted our analysis to 3DL1, 3DL2, 2DL4, 2DS3, and 2DS4 KIR transcripts 6 months after SCT. Absolute counts of NK and CD8 T cells were determined by flow cytometry, and KIR transcripts were quantified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at days 14, 28, 60, 100, and 180 after transplantation.

While many of the key mechanisms underlying its carcinogenic effects remain unknown, there is increasing evidence that chromosomal alterations play an important role in the development of the induced leukemias. Inhibition of enzymes involved in DNA replication and maintenance such as topoisomerases by benzene metabolites represents a potential mechanism by which benzene may induce its chromosome-altering effects. Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that bioactivated benzene metabolites are capable of inhibiting topoisomerase II (topo II) in isolated enzyme and cell systems as well as in mice administered benzene in vivo. The current studies were designed to build upon this hypothesis, and show that in the presence of human myeloperoxidase and H2O2, hydroquinone can be activated to a potent topo II inhibitor. In the absence of dithiothreitol, partial inhibition can be seen at hydroquinone concentrations as low as 50 nM. The potential role of topo II inhibition in the development of benzene-induced leukemia is also discussed in the context of other known leukemia-inducing agents. Current evidence indicates that multiple mechanisms are likely to contribute to benzene-induced leukemias, and that inhibition of topo II could represent an important step in the development of certain leukemia subtypes.","['Eastmond, David A', 'Mondrala, Scott T', 'Hasegawa, Leslie']","['Eastmond DA', 'Mondrala ST', 'Hasegawa L']","['Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program, 5429 Boyce Hall, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA. david.eastmond@ucr.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Kinetoplast)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Kinetoplast', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*enzymology', 'Peroxidase/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00087-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:207-16. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.024.

It is believed that benzene does not initiate leukemias directly, but rather generates DNA damage through a series of phenolic and quinone-based metabolites, especially 1,4-benzoquinone. Since the DNA damage induced by 1,4-benzoquinone is consistent with that of topoisomerase II-targeted drugs, it has been proposed that the compound initiates specific types of leukemia by acting as a topoisomerase II poison. This hypothesis, however, was not supported by initial in vitro studies. While 1,4-benzoquinone inhibited topoisomerase II catalysis, increases in enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage were not observed. Because of the potential involvement of topoisomerase II in benzene-induced leukemias, we re-examined the effects of benzene metabolites (including 1,4-benzoquinone, 1,4-hydroquinone, catechol, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, 2,2'-biphenol, and 4,4'-biphenol) on DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIalpha. In contrast to previous reports, we found that 1,4-benzoquinone was a strong topoisomerase II poison and was more potent in vitro than the anticancer drug etoposide. Other metabolites displayed considerably less activity. DNA cleavage enhancement by 1,4-benzoquinone was unseen in previous studies due to the presence of reducing agents and the incubation of 1,4-benzoquinone with the enzyme prior to the addition of DNA. Unlike anticancer drugs such as etoposide that interact with topoisomerase IIalpha in a noncovalent manner, the actions of 1,4-benzoquinone appear to involve a covalent attachment to the enzyme. Finally, 1,4-benzoquinone stimulated DNA cleavage by topoisomerase IIalpha in cultured human cells. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that topoisomerase IIalpha plays a role in the initiation of some benzene-induced leukemias.","['Lindsey, R Hunter', 'Bender, Ryan P', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Lindsey RH', 'Bender RP', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University, School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Benzene/metabolism/toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00086-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:197-205. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.035.

We studied 306 consecutive patients referred to the University of Chicago with cytogenetic analyses. Since 1972, 141 males and 165 females with a median age of 51 years (range: 3-83 years) at primary diagnosis and 58 years (range: 6-86 years) at secondary diagnosis were analyzed. Patients had received various cytotoxic agents including alkylating agents (240 patients, 78%) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (115 patients, 39%). One hundred and twenty-one (40%) had received CT alone, 43 (14%) had received RT alone, and 139 (45%) had received both modalities. At diagnosis of t-AML, 282 (92%) had clonal abnormalities involving chromosome 5 (n=63), chromosome 7 (n=85), both chromosomes 5 and 7 (n=66), recurring balanced rearrangements (n=31), or other clonal abnormalities (n=39); 24 had a normal karyotype. Abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 accounted for 76% of all cases with an abnormal karyotype. Seventeen patients had developed t-AML after autologous stem cell transplantation, but no unique pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities was observed. Patients presenting with acute leukemia were more likely to have a balanced rearrangement than those presenting with myelodysplasia (28% versus 4%, p<0.0001). Shorter latency was observed for patients with balanced rearrangements (median: 28 months versus 67 months; p<0.0001). Median survival after diagnosis of t-AML was 8 months; survival at 5 years was less than 10%. To gain insights into the molecular basis of this disease, we performed gene expression profiling of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from t-AML patients. We found distinct subtypes of t-AML that have characteristic gene expression patterns. Common to each of the subgroups are gene expression patterns typical of arrested differentiation in early progenitor cells. Leukemias with a -5/del(5q) have a higher expression of genes involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2), checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), and loss of expression of the gene encoding interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP). A second subgroup of t-AML is characterized by down-regulation of transcription factors involved in early hematopoiesis (TAL1, GATA1, and EKLF) and overexpression of proteins involved in signaling pathways in myeloid cells (FLT3) and cell survival (BCL2). Establishing the molecular pathways involved in t-AML may facilitate the identification of selectively expressed genes that can be exploited for the development of targeted therapies.","['Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, MC-2115, 5341 S.

We have identified an additional pathology whereby cells reaching the earliest stage of chromatin cleavage have the potential to suppress apoptotic execution and survive. One specific cleavage event associated with this process is restricted to a location within the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene at 11q23. The site of cleavage is consistent with the location where large, approximately 50 kbp loops of supercoiled DNA are attached to the nuclear matrix. Cells modified by this process generate MLL translocations, as shown by inverse PCR, that survive for days to weeks but which have no known relationship with clinical disease. Using a specific approach, cells stimulated by anti-CD95 antibody, a potent stimulator of the apoptotic program, facilitated creation of the MLL-AF9 fusion gene. Further, this rearrangement, which is commonly observed in patients with AML linked to exposure to cytotoxic agents, was efficiently transcribed in cells that were able to undergo cell division. These data are discussed in the context of benzene and benzene metabolite toxicity that impacts the process of apoptosis and is known to lead to leukemic disease.","['Vaughan, Andrew T', 'Betti, Christopher J', 'Villalobos, Michael J', 'Premkumar, Kumpati', 'Cline, Edith', 'Jiang, Qun', 'Diaz, Manuel O']","['Vaughan AT', 'Betti CJ', 'Villalobos MJ', 'Premkumar K', 'Cline E', 'Jiang Q', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, Davis, 4501 X Street, Suite G 126, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA. andrew.vaughn@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00084-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:179-85. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.022.

Oncogene activation, including c-Myb activation, is one of the earliest steps leading to the formation of leukemic cells, however the molecular mechanisms involved in these events are poorly understood. Given that oxidative stress can alter the activity and fate of cell signaling pathways we hypothesize that the bioactivation of benzene leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which if not detoxified can alter the c-Myb signaling pathway. Using chicken erythroblast HD3 cells we have shown that exposure to the benzene metabolites catechol, benzoquinone, and hydroquinone leads to increased c-Myb activity, increased phosphorylation of c-Myb and increased production of ROS supporting our hypothesis. Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by environmental contaminants has also been associated with carcinogenesis and mice lacking this receptor are resistant to benzene-initiated hematotoxicity. Using wild type and AhR deficient cells we are investigating the role of this receptor in benzene-initiated alterations in the c-Myb signaling pathway. We have found that both wild type and AhR deficient cells are sensitive to catechol and hydroquinone-initiated increases in c-Myb activity while both cell types are resistant to benzene-initiated alterations leaving the role of the AhR still undetermined. Interestingly, protein expression of c-Myb is increased after catechol exposure in AhR deficient cells while decreased in wild-type cells. Further studies on the role of the AhR in benzene-initiated alterations on the c-Myb signaling pathway are on going.","['Wan, Joanne', 'Badham, Helen J', 'Winn, Louise']","['Wan J', 'Badham HJ', 'Winn L']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and School of Environmental Studies, Queen's University, Botterell Hall Room 557, Kingston, Ont., Canada K7L 3N6.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00083-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:171-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.037.

It is known to detoxify benzene-derived quinones and generate antioxidant forms of ubiquinone and Vitamin E. Recently suggested roles for NQO1 which may have relevance for mechanisms underlying benzene toxicity include modulation of cellular redox balance, direct scavenging of superoxide, stabilization of p53 and stabilization of microtubules. The NQO1*2 polymorphism is a single nucleotide polymorphism, a C to T change at position 609 of the NQO1 cDNA coding for a proline to serine change at position 187 of the amino acid structure of the protein. The mutant NQO1*2 protein is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasomal system resulting in a lack of NQO1 protein in individuals carrying the NQO1*2/*2 genotype. The NQO1*2 polymorphism predisposes to benzene toxicity and to various forms of leukemias. NQO1-knockout animals demonstrate myeloid hyperplasia and increased benzene-induced hematotoxicity. NQO1 is not present in freshly isolated human bone marrow hematopoietic cells but can be induced by benzene metabolites. Increases in NQO1 were not observed in NQO1*2/*2 hematopoietic cells, presumably because of the instability of the NQO1*2 protein, suggesting that cells with this genotype would not benefit from any protective effects of NQO1. NQO1 is present in human bone marrow stroma and particularly in endothelial cells.

Chronic benzene poisoning (CBP) can be found among workers with excessive benzene exposure. CBP could give the appearance of different types of disorders such as leukopenia, agranulocytosis, anemia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and leukemia. This paper describes 43 CBP cases with the patients' ages ranging from 18 to 36 years (average: 23 years). Among them, 13 (30%) were male and 30 (70%) were female. Their job titles were furniture maker, shoemaker, industrial painter and metal shop worker. Their work durations ranged from 1.5 to 72 months (average: 14 months). Benzene levels in these workplaces exceeded 30 mg/m3. Ten of the 43 cases (23%) were diagnosed as mild cases of CBP, another 10 (23%) were moderate, and 23 (53%) were severe. Treatment for CBP included the following: cessation of benzene exposure, general supportive therapy, antibiotics, vitamins, corticosteroids, androgens, colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF), blood component therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. Thirty-three (77%) of the cases recovered completely, nine (21%) cases improved, and one (2%) died. In general, prognosis of CBP cases is optimistic when appropriate treatment is given. However, a few of the benzene-induced AA cases showed no response to treatment, which raises questions about the traditional view of the pathogenesis of the illness. Furthermore, only a part of the population with the same level of benzene exposure would suffer from the disease. Still, CBP cases with the same benzene exposure level exhibited different extents of severity of the illness. This evidence suggests strongly the existence of individual susceptibility. Detection of the biological markers regarding the individual susceptibility would be valuable for screening workers who are not suitable to be exposed to benzene.","['Kuang, Shouren', 'Liang, Weihui']","['Kuang S', 'Liang W']","['Guangdong Poison Control Center, 165# Xin-gang Road, Guangzhou 510300, PR China. kuang_sr@21cn.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Androgens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/*poisoning', 'Androgens/therapeutic use', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Benzene/*poisoning', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'China', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Pancytopenia/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00078-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:129-35. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.038.

Since 1981, a preparation containing more than 1% benzene is not allowed to be manufactured, used or dealt with in the workplace, except in laboratories and in those situations benzene must be used in a completely sealed process as specified in Industrial Safety and Health Act (ISHA). Claims for compensation of hematopoietic diseases related to benzene have been rising even though the work environment has been improved. This study was conducted to assess the status of benzene exposure in different industries in Korea. We reviewed the claimed cases investigated by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA) between 1992 and 2000. The Survey of National Work Environment Status in 1998 was analyzed to assume the number of workers and factories exposed to benzene. In 2000, six factories were investigated to evaluate benzene exposure. Personal air monitoring was performed in 61 workers and urine samples were collected from 57 workers to measure trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA). Hematologic examination has performed. Thirty-four cases of hematopoietic diseases were investigated by KOSHA including eight cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and eight cases of acute myelocytic leukemia. Eight cases were accepted as related to benzene exposure. The number of workers possibly exposed to benzene can be estimated to be 196,182 workers from 6219 factories based on the database. The geometric mean of benzene in air was 0.094 (0.005-5.311) ppm. Seven samples were higher than 1 ppm but they did not go over the 10 ppm occupational exposure limit (OEL) value in Korea. The geometric mean of trans,trans-muconic acid in urine was 0.966 (0.24-2.74) mg/g creatinine. The benzene exposure level was low except in a factory where benzene was used to polymerize other chemicals. The ambient benzene from 0.1 to 1 ppm was significantly correlated with urine t,t-MA concentration (r=0.733, p<0.01). Hematologic parameters did not show significant difference among groups divided into the level of exposure. Korean workers were not highly exposed to benzene and the level of exposure was mostly less than 1 ppm. However, there might be an excessive risk of hematopoietic disorders due to relatively high past exposure. The OEL value of benzene was amended to 1 ppm from 10 ppm in 2002 and was effective since July 2003.","['Kang, Seong-Kyu', 'Lee, Mi-Young', 'Kim, Tae-Kyun', 'Lee, Jeong-Oh', 'Ahn, Yeon Soon']","['Kang SK', 'Lee MY', 'Kim TK', 'Lee JO', 'Ahn YS']","['Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute (OSHRI), Korea Occupational Safety and Health agency (KOSHA), 34-4 Gusan-dong, Bupyeong-gu, Incheon 403-711, Republic of Korea. skk@kosha.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/*analysis/standards/*toxicity', 'Benzene/*analysis/standards/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers/urine', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Industry/classification', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Phenol/urine', 'Sorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00071-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:65-74. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.011.

More recently (1997), an increased risk of NHL was reported among 74,828 workers exposed to benzene and other chemicals in a variety of industries in China. On the contrary, no increased risk of NHL was reported in a cohort of 1,165 workers at two rubber hydrochloride plants in Ohio (US), who were exposed to extremely high levels of benzene and were found to have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia. In another large cohort of some 7,676 US workers exposed to benzene, no increased risk of NHL was reported. Similarly, no increased risk of NHL was reported in a combined cohort of 308,199 petroleum workers in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy and Finland, who were exposed to benzene or benzene-containing petroleum products. The lack of an association between benzene exposure and NHL in cohort studies is supported by case-control studies from the US, Canada, Italy and the UK. To further investigate the relationship between benzene exposure and NHL, we are conducting a hospital-based case-control study in Shanghai, China. Cases are newly diagnosed NHL patients at 29 hospitals in Shanghai. For each case, two matched controls are selected among patients without any lymphatic or hematopoietic diseases at the same hospital. Demographic, employment, medical and lifestyle information is obtained through questionnaires (primary and secondary). Sources for benzene exposure information include a database of 50,000+ benzene measurements maintained by the Shanghai Municipal Institute of Public Health Supervision (IPHS), Shanghai District IPHS, walk-through surveys at factories, additional measurements at factories and reports in Chinese medical journals. Patient enrollment started in 2003 and it is estimated that the study will have 400-450 NHL cases by December 2006.

Exposure had been retrospectively estimated for each individual occupational history using an algorithm in a relational database. Benzene exposure measurements, supplied by Australian petroleum companies, were used to estimate exposure for specific tasks. The tasks carried out within each job, the products handled, and the technology used, were identified from structured interviews with contemporary colleagues. More than half of the subjects started work after 1965 and had an average exposure period of 20 years. Exposure was low; nearly 85% of the cumulative exposure estimates were at or below 10 ppm-years. Matched analyses showed that leukemia risk increased with increasing cumulative benzene exposures and with increasing exposure intensity of the highest-exposed job. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma were not associated with benzene exposure. A reanalysis reported here, showed that for the 7 leukemia case-sets with greater than 16 ppm-years cumulative exposure, the odds ratio was 51.9 (5.6-477) when compared to the 2 lowest exposed categories combined to form a new reference category. The addition of occasional high exposures, e.g. as a result of spillages, increased exposure for 25% of subjects but for most, the increase was less than 5% of total exposure. The addition of these exposures reduced the odds ratios. Cumulative exposures did not range as high as those in comparable studies; however, the recent nature of the cohort and local handling practices can explain these differences.","['Glass, D C', 'Gray, C N', 'Jolley, D J', 'Gibbons, C', 'Sim, M R']","['Glass DC', 'Gray CN', 'Jolley DJ', 'Gibbons C', 'Sim MR']","['Monash University, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Central and Eastern Clinical School, Alfred Hospital, Commercial Road, Melbourne, Vic. 3004, Australia. deborah.glass@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Employment/classification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Petroleum']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00066-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:23-32. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.006.

Published studies were characterized according to the type of industry studied and design, exposure assessment, disease classification, and control for confounding variables. Study design consisted of either cohort studies or case-control studies, which were further categorized into population-based and nested case-control studies. Disease classification considered the source of diagnostic information, whether there was clinical confirmation from medical records or histopathological, morphological and/or cytogenetic reviews, and as to whether the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or the French-American-British (FAB) schemes were used (no studies used the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification scheme). Nine cohort and 13 case-control studies met inclusion criteria for this review. High and significant acute myeloid leukemia risks with positive dose response relationships were identified across study designs, particularly in the ""well-conducted"" cohort studies and especially in more highly exposed workers in rubber, shoe, and paint industries. Risks for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tended to show elevations in nested case-control studies, with possible dose response relationships in at least two of the three studies. However, cohort studies on CLL show no such risks. Data for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia are sparse and inconclusive.","['Schnatter, A Robert', 'Rosamilia, Kim', 'Wojcik, Nancy C']","['Schnatter AR', 'Rosamilia K', 'Wojcik NC']","['ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences Inc., 1545 Route 22 East Annandale, NJ 08801, USA. a.r.schnatter@exxonmobil.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Petroleum)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/classification/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/classification/*epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Petroleum', 'Printing', 'Rubber', 'Shoes']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/10/04 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(05)00065-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2005 May 30;153-154:9-21. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.039.

The results showed that MAP inhibited the cells viability in time and concentration-dependent characteristics. We found that anti-proliferative effect of MAP was associated with apoptosis on HL-60 cells by determinations of morphological changes and oligonucleosomal DNA fragments. In addition, the content of nitric oxide (NO) and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release increased when the cells incubated with MAP at various concentrations and times.

It was purified by affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S, and gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 200. Compared with Con A, knife bean lectin started to stimulate [methyl-(3)H]thymidine uptake by mouse splenocytes at a lower concentration, and more potently inhibited proliferation of L1210 leukemia cells. In contrast to Con A, the mitogenic activity of knife bean lectin toward mouse splenocytes, but not its antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells, could be abrogated by 250 mM glucose.

The drug incorporation into DNA poisons the extending primer against further incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides including dCTP, ultimately inhibiting DNA synthesis. While intracellular ara-CTP concentration has been found to predict clinical outcome, cytotoxicity in vitro is determined primarily by the extent of drug incorporation into DNA. However, clinically appropriate quantitation methods for ara-C at the DNA level have not been available. We developed a sensitive new method for monitoring ara-C incorporated into DNA in vivo. After DNA from leukemic cells was fractionated using the Schmidt-Thannhauser-Schneider method, it was degraded to constituent nucleosides to release ara-C, which was isolated from the nucleosides using HPLC and then measured by radioimmunoassay. Recovery for DNA fractionation, ara-C release by degradation, and ara-C isolation were 92.0+/-6.4%, 90.7+/-9.4%, and 98.5+/-1.4%, respectively. The method was found to determine ara-C incorporation into DNA of ara-C-treated HL 60 cells in vitro with minimal interassay variation. The values determined were compatible with those determined by scintillation counting in parallel experiments using tritiated ara-C. Our method could be used to monitor DNA-incorporated ara-C concentrations during ara-C therapy, together with plasma ara-C and intracellular ara-CTP concentrations. ara-C incorporation into DNA appeared to be associated with intracellular retention of ara-CTP or persistence of plasma ara-C. Thus, the present method is sensitive, accurate, precise, and may permit therapeutic drug monitoring at the DNA level for better individualization of antileukemic regimens.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Fukui, 23 Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. tyamauch@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp <tyamauch@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp>']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/analysis/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*analysis/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/metabolism', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/07 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/06/07 09:00'],"['2004/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00191-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.03.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Jun 15;69(12):1795-803. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.03.013.

The distillation of high-density array results into sets of signature markers promises to improve disease staging, risk stratification and treatment decisions. To accommodate the growing requirement for multiplex testing, clinical laboratories are converting several single-analyte tests into array-based formats. However, adoption of array technologies provides several challenges to the laboratory, which must evaluate these new formats, train laboratory personnel, market the new services and obtain reimbursement for new analytes. Liquid-bead arrays are an attractive format for routine clinical diagnostics due to a combination of appropriate analyte density, simultaneous array decoding and detection, and flexibility for rapid customization. In this review, the suitability of several array platforms to diagnostic testing and applications of liquid-bead arrays for cystic fibrosis testing, multidisease carrier status assays and leukemia subtyping are discussed. As our understanding of the clinical utility of new or established biomarkers and recommendations for testing change, flexibility and adaptability of array platforms will be imperative.

In this paper, the details of using LC/MS to analyze AZT amino acid phosphoramidates in biological samples are discussed. LC/MS is an efficient method for analyzing multiple samples containing several analytes in a short period of time. The method also provides high selectivity and sensitivity, and requires minimal sample preparation.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Cancer registry and National Grid records. SUBJECTS: Records of 29 081 children with cancer, including 9700 with leukaemia. Children were aged 0-14 years and born in England and Wales, 1962-95. Controls were individually matched for sex, approximate date of birth, and birth registration district. No active participation was required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distance from home address at birth to the nearest high voltage overhead power line in existence at the time. RESULTS: Compared with those who lived > 600 m from a line at birth, children who lived within 200 m had a relative risk of leukaemia of 1.69 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.53); those born between 200 and 600 m had a relative risk of 1.23 (1.02 to 1.49). There was a significant (P < 0.01) trend in risk in relation to the reciprocal of distance from the line. No excess risk in relation to proximity to lines was found for other childhood cancers. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between childhood leukaemia and proximity of home address at birth to high voltage power lines, and the apparent risk extends to a greater distance than would have been expected from previous studies. About 4% of children in England and Wales live within 600 m of high voltage lines at birth. If the association is causal, about 1% of childhood leukaemia in England and Wales would be attributable to these lines, though this estimate has considerable statistical uncertainty. There is no accepted biological mechanism to explain the epidemiological results; indeed, the relation may be due to chance or confounding.","['Draper, Gerald', 'Vincent, Tim', 'Kroll, Mary E', 'Swanson, John']","['Draper G', 'Vincent T', 'Kroll ME', 'Swanson J']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Oxford OX2 6HJ. gerald.draper@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'England/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2005/06/04 09:00,2005/06/24 09:00,['2005/06/04 09:00'],"['2005/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['330/7503/1290 [pii]', '10.1136/bmj.330.7503.1290 [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ. 2005 Jun 4;330(7503):1290. doi: 10.1136/bmj.330.7503.1290.,,,,"['BMJ. 2005 Jun 4;330(7503):1279-80.

In our analysis of 702 integration sites in rhesus macaques that underwent transplantation up to 7 years earlier with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived retroviral vectors containing marker genes, we detected insertion into one locus, the Mds1/Evi1 region, a total of 14 times in 9 animals. Mds1/Evi1 integrations were observed stably long term, primarily in myeloid cells. We hypothesize that this over-representation likely results from an impact on the self-renewal and engraftment potential of CD34+ progenitor cells via insertional mutagenesis at this specific locus. There is no evidence of ongoing in vivo clonal expansion of the Mds1/Evi1 populations, and all animals are hematologically normal without evidence for leukemia.

It has been hypothesized that genetic factors other than histocompatibility disparity may play a role in predisposition to developing CML. In this regard, T helper types 1 and 2 (Th1 and Th2) cytokines and their gene polymorphism seem to be important. Overall expression and secretion of cytokines are dependent, at least in part, on genetic polymorphism (nucleotide variations) within the promoter region or other regulatory sequences of cytokine genes. The majority of polymorphisms described are single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). The objective of this study was to analyse the genetic profile of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in 30 Iranian patients with CML and 40 healthy subjects. In the patients and control subjects, the allelic and genotype frequencies were determined for the cytokine genes. All typing were performed with a polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) assay. Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated and compared with those of normal controls. The results showed that the most frequent genotypes in our patients were transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta TG/TG, interferon (IFN)-gamma AT, interleukin (IL)-4 CC at position -590, TT at position -33, and IL-10 ACC/ACC and ATA/ATA. In contrast, the genotypes TGF-beta CG/CG, IL-2 TT at position -330, IL-4 CT at position -590, CT at position -33, and IL-10 GCC/ACC were seen at much lower frequencies. The results suggest that production of TGF-beta in CML patients is higher and production of IL-4 and IL-10 is lower than in normal subjects.","['Amirzargar, A A', 'Bagheri, M', 'Ghavamzadeh, A', 'Alimoghadam, K', 'Khosravi, F', 'Rezaei, N', 'Moheydin, M', 'Ansaripour, B', 'Moradi, B', 'Nikbin, B']","['Amirzargar AA', 'Bagheri M', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghadam K', 'Khosravi F', 'Rezaei N', 'Moheydin M', 'Ansaripour B', 'Moradi B', 'Nikbin B']","['Immunogenetics Laboratory, Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. amirzargar_ali@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunogenet,International journal of immunogenetics,101232337,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*immunology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/immunology/metabolism']",2005/06/04 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2005/06/04 09:00'],"['2005/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJI502 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1744-313X.2005.00502.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunogenet. 2005 Jun;32(3):167-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-313X.2005.00502.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral blood glass slide is examined directly in the SEM following application of a thin carbon coat. The morphology of the nonneoplastic and neoplastic smears is described in detail utilizing the SEM secondary electron detector and backscattered electron detectors. Certain cell features are measured as well with the use of the measuring software resident in the SEM. The appearance of the SEM images of peripheral smear slides is compared to that of slides from fixed, processed, and sectioned bone marrow cases previously reported. The problem of cell constituent loss and overall shrinkage in the routinely processed and sectioned material is noted. The lack of these problems in the peripheral blood smear slides and their better appearance is emphasized. The resemblance of neoplastic cells to their normal counterparts is discussed. The monoblast resembles the normal monocyte but both cell size and nuclear size are greater; the moderately reticulated nuclear chromatin distinguishes the monoblast. Neoplastic lymphoid cells maintain the wispy extensions of the cytoplasm perimeter resembling microvilli and thereby differ from myeloid and monocytic cells. The neoplastic lymphoid cell shows coarse clumping of nuclear chromatin and in some instances coarse chromatin anastomoses to distinguish it from the normal lymphocyte. Lymphoid cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are 33% larger than those of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and normal lymphocytes. The neoplastic myeloblast has a finely granular nuclear chromatin, maintains a smooth cytoplasmic perimeter, and may show cytoplasmic reticulations. The myeloblast differs from the lymphoblast in that the former has a smooth cytoplasm perimeter. Further, myeloblasts show nuclear lobulations more frequently than lymphoblasts. Comparison of SEM findings with the three case studies by flow cytometry indicates satisfactory correlation. In case 15, flow cytometry indicated a monocyte subset positive for CD14 and CD64 among the neoplastic myeloid forms. A candidate for such a cell is recognized morphologically as well. The availability for SEM ultrastructural study of all the cells, both neoplastic and nonneoplastic, on a routine diagnostic smear slide is emphasized.","['Terzakis, John A', 'Santagada, Eugene', 'Hernandez, Ascension', 'Taskin, Metin']","['Terzakis JA', 'Santagada E', 'Hernandez A', 'Taskin M']","['Department of Pathology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/*pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Size', '*Cytodiagnosis/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Male', '*Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2005/06/04 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/06/04 09:00'],"['2005/06/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01913120490903459 [doi]'],ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 2005 Jan-Feb;29(1):19-28. doi: 10.1080/01913120490903459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RI AlloSCT allegedly eradicates malignant cells through a graft-versus-leukemia/graft-versus-tumor effect provided by alloreactive donor T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, or both. Various studies have clearly demonstrated a graft-versus-leukemia/graft-versus-tumor effect in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Acute short-term toxicity, including infection and organ decompensation after myeloablative conditioning therapy, can result in a significant incidence of early transplant-related mortality. More importantly, long-term late effects-including growth retardation, infertility, and secondary malignancies-are major complications after myeloablative conditioning therapy, especially in vulnerable children, who are more susceptible to these complications. Recent results comparing RI conditioning with myeloablative conditioning followed by HLA-matched sibling AlloSCT have demonstrated a significant reduction in use of blood products, risk of infections, transplant-related mortality, length of hospitalization, and feasibility of conditioning therapy in outpatient settings. Despite the success of RI AlloSCT, large prospective randomized multicenter studies are necessary to define the appropriate patient population, optimal conditioning regimens and pretransplantation immunosuppression, role of donor lymphocyte infusions, duration of hospitalization, overall survival, cost-benefit ratio, and differences in long-term effects to evaluate the role of RI AlloSCT more fully. We review the recent experience of RI AlloSCT in adults and children with both malignant and nonmalignant diseases and discuss the challenges for the future.","['Satwani, Prakash', 'Harrison, Lauren', 'Morris, Erin', 'Del Toro, Gustavo', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Satwani P', 'Harrison L', 'Morris E', 'Del Toro G', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/trends', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879105002338 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jun;11(6):403-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.04.002.,128,"['5P30CA13697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21AR49330/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting of the pathogenetically relevant BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase with the selective kinase inhibitor imatinib has induced remissions with almost complete disappearance of any signs and symptoms of CML.

Using Aspergillus nidulans strains this work presents a new short term-test that, most importantly, enables the rapid and inexpensive detection of volatile pollutants that induce genotoxic/carcinogenic effects in animals. The main aim is to contribute to environmental health protection, and special attention is directed to monitoring the hazard posed by benzene (as a carcinogenic agent model) mainly because its ubiquitous presence often leads to severe noxious effects in humans among whom increased rates of human leukemia have been reported. To evaluate even the submutagenic effects of benzene fumes, two Aspergillus nidulans diploid strains, heterozygous for several auxotrophic mutations, were used. The DNA lesions produced stimulate mitotic recombination and homozygotization of auxotrophic recessive mutations. Conidial exposure to a saturated atmosphere of benzene fumes for 20 s was enough to increase the mitotic recombination frequencies significantly. Genetic analyses of treated diploids evidenced alterations related to mitotic recombination frequencies, gene expression, and allelic segregation rates. Altogether they reflect the potential of benzene to induce alterations in the fungal DNA, and albeit indirectly, they also respond for the genotoxic/carcinogenic harmful side effects widely connected to benzene. This is the first description of a sensitive, rapid and inexpensive test able to detect the submutagenic dose effects of volatile environmental compounds. In addition, despite concentrating on benzene the same test can be applied to many other pollutants, volatile or not. Additionally, the test can also be used to detect the antigenotoxic properties of foods and drugs.","['Domingues Zucchi, Tiago', 'Domingues Zucchi, Fernando', 'Poli, Paola', 'Soares de Melo, Itamar', 'Zucchi, Tania M A D']","['Domingues Zucchi T', 'Domingues Zucchi F', 'Poli P', 'Soares de Melo I', 'Zucchi TM']","['Department of Parasitology and Biotechnology Research Center, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. tzucchi@uol.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Environ Monit,Journal of environmental monitoring : JEM,100968688,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity', 'Aspergillus nidulans/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development', 'Benzene/analysis/*toxicity', 'DNA, Fungal/chemistry/genetics', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Volatilization']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/10/20 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b500219b [doi]'],ppublish,J Environ Monit. 2005 Jun;7(6):598-602. doi: 10.1039/b500219b.

We investigated 14 patients who were completely concordant for IgV(H) mutational status (unmutated vs. mutated), CD38 expression (positive vs. negative), and clinical behavior (progressive vs. stable); these patients were characterized as having either poor or good prognoses. The 2 patient subsets differed in the expression of hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1). In patients with poor prognoses, most HS1 protein was constitutively phosphorylated, whereas only a fraction was phosphorylated in patients with good prognoses. This difference was investigated in a larger cohort of 26 unselected patients. The survival curve of all 40 patients analyzed revealed that patients with predominately phosphorylated HS1 experience a significantly shorter median survival time. As HS1 is a protein pivotal in the signal cascade triggered by B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, we studied its pattern of expression following BCR engagement. Normal mature B cells stimulated by anti-IgM shifted the non- or less-phosphorylated form of HS1 toward the more phosphorylated form. Naive B cells showed both HS1 forms while memory B cells expressed mainly the phosphorylated fraction. These data indicate a central role for antigen stimulation in CLL and suggest a new therapeutic target for patients with aggressive disease.","['Scielzo, Cristina', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Conti, Antonio', 'Bachi, Angela', 'Guida, Giuseppe', 'Geuna, Massimo', 'Alessio, Massimo', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Scielzo C', 'Ghia P', 'Conti A', 'Bachi A', 'Guida G', 'Geuna M', 'Alessio M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Oncology, Universita Vita e Salute-San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/biosynthesis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/genetics']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2004/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI24276 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Jun;115(6):1644-50. doi: 10.1172/JCI24276.,,,,,,PMC1136999,,,,,,,,

The BMI-1 oncogene-driven gene expression pathway is essential for the self-renewal of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. We applied a mouse/human comparative translational genomics approach to identify an 11-gene signature that consistently displays a stem cell-resembling expression profile in distant metastatic lesions as revealed by the analysis of metastases and primary tumors from a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and cancer patients. To further validate these results, we examined the prognostic power of the 11-gene signature in several independent therapy-outcome sets of clinical samples obtained from 1,153 cancer patients diagnosed with 11 different types of cancer, including 5 epithelial malignancies (prostate, breast, lung, ovarian, and bladder cancers) and 5 nonepithelial malignancies (lymphoma, mesothelioma, medulloblastoma, glioma, and acute myeloid leukemia). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a stem cell-like expression profile of the 11-gene signature in primary tumors is a consistent powerful predictor of a short interval to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and death after therapy in cancer patients diagnosed with 11 distinct types of cancer. These data suggest the presence of a conserved BMI-1-driven pathway, which is similarly engaged in both normal stem cells and a highly malignant subset of human cancers diagnosed in a wide range of organs and uniformly exhibiting a marked propensity toward metastatic dissemination as well as a high probability of unfavorable therapy outcome.","['Glinsky, Gennadi V', 'Berezovska, Olga', 'Glinskii, Anna B']","['Glinsky GV', 'Berezovska O', 'Glinskii AB']","['Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, San Diego, California 92121, USA. gglinsky@skcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2004/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI23412 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Jun;115(6):1503-21. doi: 10.1172/JCI23412.,,"['R01 CA089827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 CA89827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Invest. 2005 Jun;115(6):1463-7.

The surface expression of several tetraspanin antigens (CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, and CD81), and their interacting proteins (CD19, CD21, and HLA-DR) were analyzed during normal B-cell maturation and compared to a group of 67 B-cell neoplasias. Three patterns of tetraspanin expression were identified in normal B cells. The first corresponded to bone marrow CD10(+) B-cell precursors (BCP) which showed high expression of CD81 and CD9, low reactivity for CD53 and negativity for CD37. CD10(-) B-lymphocytes showed downregulation of CD9/CD81 and upregulation of CD53/CD37. Plasma cells showed re-expressed CD9 and downregulated CD37. Hierarchical clustering analysis of flow cytometry immunophenotypic data showed a good correlation between the tumor differentiation stage and the pattern of tetraspanin expression, with all analyzed individual samples classified into three major groups, independently of their normal or neoplastic origin. Despite this, neoplastic B-cells frequently showed aberrantly high/low expression of the different markers analyzed.

Endostatin (ES), a fragment of collagen XVIII, is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis that has shown therapeutic activity in solid tumors in various preclinical models. Using microencapsulation technology, we studied the therapeutic effect of ES in AML. While ES had no effect on proliferation of M1 murine leukemic cells in vitro, ES producing microbeads significantly inhibited growth of subcutaneous chloromas in SCID mice as compared to controls. In a leukemia model using M1 cells the concomitant treatment of mice with ES microbeads prolonged median survival significantly. Histological analysis revealed a decreased microvessel density and a reduced number of CD31-positive single cells, putatively endothelial progenitor cells, in the bone marrow of treated animals. Taken together, ES has inhibitory effects on neo-angiogenesis in the bone marrow and on progression of leukemia in vivo. These experiments suggest a possible therapeutic role of antiangiogenic gene therapy with ES in AML.","['Schuch, G', 'Oliveira-Ferrer, L', 'Loges, S', 'Laack, E', 'Bokemeyer, C', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Fiedler, W', 'Ergun, S']","['Schuch G', 'Oliveira-Ferrer L', 'Loges S', 'Laack E', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Fiedler W', 'Ergun S']","['Department of Medicine, Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. schuch@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Endostatins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Compounding', 'Endostatins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403824 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403824 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1312-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403824.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1312-1317.']",,,,,

Ligand stimulation of the receptor promotes the survival and proliferation of leukemia cells. Strategies targeting FLT3 using monoclonal antibodies may therefore constitute an effective therapeutic approach for these leukemia. Towards this, we selected a naive antibody phage display library on both recombinant FLT3 receptor protein and FLT3-expressing leukemia cells using a tailored selection scheme that was designed to isolate antagonistic phage antibodies that not only interfere with receptor/ligand binding but also trigger receptor internalization upon cell surface binding. Phage antibodies were screened first for their ability to bind to cell surface receptor and induce receptor internalization, followed by their activity in blocking ligand-receptor interaction and neutralizing ligand-stimulated receptor activation and cell proliferation. We identified three fully human antibodies, EB10, A2IN, and D4-3, which bound specifically to both soluble and cell surface-expressed FLT3. All three antibodies were shown to be internalized upon binding to cell surface-expressed receptor in a time-dependent fashion. EB10 and D4-3 blocked ligand binding to the receptor with IC(50)s of 14 and 7 nM, respectively. Further, EB10 and D4-3 inhibited FLT3 ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation in EOL-1 leukemia cells. Taken together, these results suggest that both EB10 and D4-3 may represent excellent therapeutic candidates for the treatment of FLT3-expressing human leukemia, both as unmodified antibodies and as conjugates of cytotoxic agents.","['Williams, B', 'Atkins, A', 'Zhang, H', 'Lu, D', 'Jimenez, X', 'Li, H', 'Wang, M-N', 'Ludwig, D', 'Balderes, P', 'Witte, L', 'Li, Y', 'Zhu, Z']","['Williams B', 'Atkins A', 'Zhang H', 'Lu D', 'Jimenez X', 'Li H', 'Wang MN', 'Ludwig D', 'Balderes P', 'Witte L', 'Li Y', 'Zhu Z']","['Department of Antibody Technology, ImClone Systems Incorporated, New York, NY 10014, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Peptide Library', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403825 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403825 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1432-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403825.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1432-1438.']",,,,,

SET mediates many functions including chromatin remodeling, transcription, apoptosis and cell cycle control. We report that overexpression of SET directs differentiation of the human promonocytic cell line U937 along the dendritic cell (DC) pathway, as cells display typical morphologic changes associated with DC fate and express the DC surface markers CD11b and CD86. Differentiation occurs via a calcium-dependent mechanism involving the CaMKII and MAPK/ERK pathways. Similar responses are elicited by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment with the distinction that IFN-gamma signaling activates the DNA-binding activity of STAT1 whereas SET overexpression does not. In addition, unlike IFN-gamma signaling, SET generated stress-induced p38/MAPK activity. Interestingly, IFN-gamma treatment transiently upregulated endogenous SET in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that SET is part of both IFN-gamma-mediated and stress-mediated cellular responses and that SET induces cell differentiation via calcium and MAPK/ERK pathways.","['Kandilci, A', 'Grosveld, G C']","['Kandilci A', 'Grosveld GC']","[""Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

The novel triterpenoid, C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolen-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me), induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemic cell lines and in primary AML samples. In this report, the effects of CDDO-Me on CD34(+) AML progenitor cells in vitro were examined. CDDO-Me induced apoptosis in all but one of ten AML samples. CDDO-Me is known to inhibit the activation of ERK1/2. In this series of primary AML samples, ERK was expressed and phosphorylated in all patient samples studied and CDDO-Me inhibited ERK phosphorylation in five of 10 samples. However, CDDO-Me induced apoptosis in four of five samples without decreasing pERK levels, suggesting that pERK is not the sole target of the compound. CDDO-Me induced phosphorylation of p38 in AML-derived U937 cells. Pretreatment of U937 cells with a p38 inhibitor protected cells from the cyto-toxic effects of CDDO-Me. These findings suggest a role for p38 in CDDO-Me-induced apoptosis. In preliminary studies, CDDO-Me induced p38 phosphorylation in seven of eight primary AML samples. These findings suggest that CDDO-Me treatment shifts cell signaling away from cyto-protective pathways and thus CDDO-Me may be effective for the treatment of AML.","['Konopleva, M', 'Contractor, R', 'Kurinna, S M', 'Chen, W', 'Andreeff, M', 'Ruvolo, P P']","['Konopleva M', 'Contractor R', 'Kurinna SM', 'Chen W', 'Andreeff M', 'Ruvolo PP']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403828 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403828 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1350-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403828.,,['R01 CA089346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1350-1354.']",,,,,

Little information is available on the capacity of structurally different HDAC inhibitors to induce terminal cell differentiation in different cell types in relation to enzyme inhibition and subtype selectivity. Consequently, the aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive comparison of these effects. New biarylalanine inhibitors of HDAC were synthesized and compared to a series of standard inhibitors from different laboratories. Chromatographically purified rat liver and immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged recombinant human HDACs were used as sources of HDAC activity. Enzyme inhibition was studied using a fluorescent substrate and its conversion was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. The ability to induce cell differentiation was compared in murine (Friend DS-19) and human (K562) erythroleukemic cell lines, and was quantified by benzidine staining. Inhibition of cell proliferation was evaluated by cell counting. All HDAC inhibitors were identified as potent inhibitors of erythroleukemic cell proliferation. However, we observed a complex pattern of differentiation induction: structurally similar inhibitors resulted in disparate activity profiles, whereas similar profiles were detected within distinct structural classes. Among the newly synthesized biarylalanine compounds, a 3'-methoxy derivative was identified as a very effective inducer of terminal cell differentiation. We conclude that investigation of subtype selectivity of selected HDAC inhibitors does not provide a clear link between selectivity and the observed cellular activity profile.

The results also suggest that combinations between imatinib and daunorubicin, predisolone or cytarabine may be advantageous for the treatment of Philadelphia-positive ALL.","['Hallbook, Helene', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Bjornberg, Annelie', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Lindhagen, Elin']","['Hallbook H', 'Barbany G', 'Aleskog A', 'Bjornberg A', 'Larsson R', 'Sundstrom C', 'Lindhagen E']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Division of Internal Medicine, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. helene.hallbook@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fluorometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2005/06/03 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200507000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00001813-200507000-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2005 Jul;16(6):631-4. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200507000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We randomly assigned 1491 women with axillary node-positive breast cancer to six cycles of treatment with either TAC or FAC as adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 55 months, the estimated rates of disease-free survival at five years were 75 percent among the 745 patients randomly assigned to receive TAC and 68 percent among the 746 randomly assigned to receive FAC, representing a 28 percent reduction in the risk of relapse (P=0.001) in the TAC group. The estimated rates of overall survival at five years were 87 percent and 81 percent, respectively. Treatment with TAC resulted in a 30 percent reduction in the risk of death (P=0.008). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 65.5 percent in the TAC group and 49.3 percent in the FAC group (P<0.001); rates of febrile neutropenia were 24.7 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively (P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 3.9 percent of the patients who received TAC and 2.2 percent of those who received FAC (P=0.05); no deaths occurred as a result of infection. Two patients in each group died during treatment. Congestive heart failure and acute myeloid leukemia occurred in less than 2 percent of the patients in each group. Quality-of-life scores decreased during chemotherapy but returned to baseline levels after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy with TAC, as compared with FAC, significantly improves the rates of disease-free and overall survival among women with operable node-positive breast cancer.","['Martin, Miguel', 'Pienkowski, Tadeusz', 'Mackey, John', 'Pawlicki, Marek', 'Guastalla, Jean-Paul', 'Weaver, Charles', 'Tomiak, Eva', 'Al-Tweigeri, Taher', 'Chap, Linnea', 'Juhos, Eva', 'Guevin, Raymond', 'Howell, Anthony', 'Fornander, Tommy', 'Hainsworth, John', 'Coleman, Robert', 'Vinholes, Jeferson', 'Modiano, Manuel', 'Pinter, Tamas', 'Tang, Shou C', 'Colwell, Bruce', 'Prady, Catherine', 'Provencher, Louise', 'Walde, David', 'Rodriguez-Lescure, Alvaro', 'Hugh, Judith', 'Loret, Camille', 'Rupin, Matthieu', 'Blitz, Sandra', 'Jacobs, Philip', 'Murawsky, Michael', 'Riva, Alessandro', 'Vogel, Charles']","['Martin M', 'Pienkowski T', 'Mackey J', 'Pawlicki M', 'Guastalla JP', 'Weaver C', 'Tomiak E', 'Al-Tweigeri T', 'Chap L', 'Juhos E', 'Guevin R', 'Howell A', 'Fornander T', 'Hainsworth J', 'Coleman R', 'Vinholes J', 'Modiano M', 'Pinter T', 'Tang SC', 'Colwell B', 'Prady C', 'Provencher L', 'Walde D', 'Rodriguez-Lescure A', 'Hugh J', 'Loret C', 'Rupin M', 'Blitz S', 'Jacobs P', 'Murawsky M', 'Riva A', 'Vogel C']","['Hospital Universitario San Carlos, Madrid, Spain. mmartin@geicam.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Docetaxel', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taxoids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['352/22/2302 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa043681 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2005 Jun 2;352(22):2302-13. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa043681.,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2005 Jun 2;352(22):2346-8.

Here, we evaluated whether Bcl-2 overexpression affects the cytotoxic activity of proteasome inhibitors taken alone or in association with conventional anticancer drugs or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Jurkat cells engineered to overexpress Bcl-2 were treated with proteasome inhibitors (MG132, epoxomicin, and bortezomib), anticancer drugs (etoposide and doxorubicin), TRAIL, or combinations of these compounds. Cell death and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. Cytosolic relocalization of cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo, caspase cleavage, and Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels were determined by immunoblotting. Nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition was done by retroviral transduction with a dominant-negative mutant of IkappaBalpha. RESULTS: Bcl-2 overexpression results in significant inhibition of apoptosis in response to proteasome inhibitors, antiblastics, and TRAIL. Addition of TRAIL to proteasome inhibitors results in a synergistic cytotoxic effect in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells, whereas this result is not reproduced by the combination of proteasome inhibitors with antiblastic drugs. Importantly, proteasome inhibitors plus TRAIL induce mitochondrial dysfunction irrespective of up-regulated Bcl-2. Bcl-2 cleavage to a fragment with putative proapoptotic activity and elimination of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 may both play a role in proteasome inhibitors-TRAIL cooperation. Conversely, nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition by proteasome inhibitors is per se insufficient to explain the observed synergy. CONCLUSIONS: Combined proteasome inhibitors and TRAIL overcome the apoptotic threshold raised by Bcl-2 and may prove useful in the treatment of chemoresistant malignancies with up-regulated Bcl-2.","['Nencioni, Alessio', 'Wille, Lucia', 'Dal Bello, Giovanna', 'Boy, Davide', 'Cirmena, Gabriella', 'Wesselborg, Sebastian', 'Belka, Claus', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Patrone, Franco', 'Ballestrero, Alberto']","['Nencioni A', 'Wille L', 'Dal Bello G', 'Boy D', 'Cirmena G', 'Wesselborg S', 'Belka C', 'Brossart P', 'Patrone F', 'Ballestrero A']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.

In this study, we sought to identify and optimize drug partners for binary and tertiary combinations with gemcitabine for use in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Drug interaction was assessed by growth inhibition assay with metabolic end points. The combination index method was used to evaluate combinations of gemcitabine with fludarabine, paclitaxel, chlorambucil, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and SN-38 in U937 human AML cells. A three-dimensional method was used to determine the effect of dose ratio and schedule on drug interaction. Mechanisms underlying interactions related to cell cycle effects and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometric and caspase-3 and -7 assays, respectively. The most synergistic binary combination was gemcitabine + fludarabine. The most synergistic tertiary combination was gemcitabine + fludarabine + paclitaxel, where the interaction was sequence dependent with paclitaxel given before gemcitabine + fludarabine, producing a 2-fold increase in synergy. Cell cycle analysis did not reveal a significant G(2)-M arrest, suggesting that the synergistic effect of paclitaxel in this combination, which produced the greatest caspase activation, might be independent of microtubule stabilization. In contrast, the gemcitabine + fludarabine + mitoxantrone combination was synergistic and schedule independent. Moreover, few ratios of gemcitabine + fludarabine to mitoxantrone were antagonistic, which could be important for clinical translation. In conclusion, synergistic interactions with gemcitabine occurred with several drugs, the most promising being gemcitabine + fludarabine, gemcitabine + fludarabine + paclitaxel, and gemcitabine + fludarabine + mitoxantrone. These findings provided a rationale for clinical trials of gemcitabine + fludarabine and gemcitabine + mitoxantrone where responses were observed in heavily pretreated AML patients.","['Shanks, Ryan H', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Flowers, James L', 'Colvin, O Michael', 'Adams, David J']","['Shanks RH', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Flowers JL', 'Colvin OM', 'Adams DJ']","['North Carolina Central University and Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/08/30 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/11/4225 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2106 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Jun 1;11(11):4225-33. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine if flavopiridol has activity in previously treated CLL using two schedules of administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously treated CLL were enrolled in two sequentially done phase II studies. Patients in the first trial received flavopiridol (50 mg/m(2)/d) as a continuous infusion (CI) for 72 hours every 2 weeks. Patients in the second trial received flavopiridol 50 mg/m(2) as a 1-hour bolus (IVB) daily for 3 days repeated every 3 weeks. Patients received up to 12 (CI cohort) or 8 (IVB cohort) cycles of therapy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the 72-hour CI phase II trial; 6 (40%) had intermediate-risk (Rai stage I or II) and 9 (60%) had high-risk (Rai stage III and IV) stages. No responses were noted in this group; 27% had stable disease and 73% had progressive disease. Thirty-six patients were enrolled in the second IVB trial, with 13 (36%) having intermediate and 23 (64%) having high-risk disease. Four patients (11%) had partial responses, 19 (53%) had stable disease, and 13 (36%) had progressive disease. The progression-free survival for responders in the IVB trial was 3, 3, 9, and 19 months. The median progression-free survival was 2 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.8-3.8] for patients in the CI trial and 3 months (95% CI, 2.5-7.4) for the IVB trial. The median overall survival was 27 months (95% CI, 20-42) for the CI trial and 24 months (95% CI, 18-31) for the IVB trial. Toxicity was manageable and included mainly myelosuppression, infections, diarrhea, and fatigue.

However, their precise natures and molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we studied TIDs recruited in progressive P815 and regressive P198 tumors of the same origin. Our data showed that P815 tumors contained CD4+ 8+ and CD4- 8- TID815 subsets, whereas P198 tumors contained CD4+ 8+ and CD4+ 8- TID198 subsets. They similarly stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation and have nitric oxide-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cells with an exception of CD4- 8- TID815 with less efficiency. The newly identified fourth CD4+ 8+ TID815 or TID198 subset and the CD4+ 8- TID198 all express high levels of IFN-gamma and interleukin (IL)-6, whereas CD4- 8- TID815 secrete a marked level of transforming growth factor-beta. Vaccination of mice with P815 tumor lysate-pulsed CD4+ 8+ TID815 or TID198 and CD4+ 8- TID198 induced IFN-gamma-secreting Th1 and effective CTL responses leading to protective immunity against P815 tumor, whereas CD4- 8- TID815 stimulated IL-10-expressing Tr1 responses leading to immune suppression. Transfer of CD4+ Tr1 cells obtained from CD4- 8- TID815-immunized wild-type, but not IL-10(-/-) mice, into CD4+ 8+ TID815 immunized mice abolished otherwise inevitable development of antitumor immunity. Taken together, our findings provide an important insight into immunologic alterations in progressive and regressive tumors and an implication for dendritic cell-based approaches in the design of cancer vaccines.","['Liu, Yongqing', 'Bi, Xuguang', 'Xu, Shulin', 'Xiang, Jim']","['Liu Y', 'Bi X', 'Xu S', 'Xiang J']","['Research Unit, Division of Health Research, Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, Department of Oncology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mastocytoma/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/11/4955 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3957 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Jun 1;65(11):4955-62. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3957.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Camptothecin-resistant P388/CPT45 cells lacking Top1 are cross-resistant to FdUMP[10] as well as to FdUMP, FdU, and the thymidylate synthase inhibitor raltitrexed (Tomudex). FdUMP[10] induces DNA single-strand breaks and cellular Top1-DNA complexes. Such complexes are also observed in response to FdUMP, FdU, raltitrexed, and FU. The FdUMP[10]-induced Top1-DNA complexes are not inhibited by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and form independently of apoptotic DNA fragmentation, indicating that they do not correspond to apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes. In biochemical assay, Top1 is directly trapped at uracil and FdU misincorporation sites.

However, little is known about the role of LMO3 in either tumorigenesis or development. In the present study, we have identified LMO3 and HEN2, which encodes a neuronal basic helix-loop-helix protein, as genes whose expression levels were higher in unfavorable neuroblastomas compared with those of favorable tumors. Immunoprecipitation and immunostaining experiments showed that LMO3 was associated with HEN2 in mammalian cell nucleus. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells stably overexpressing LMO3 showed a marked increase in cell growth, a promotion of colony formation in soft agar medium, and a rapid tumor growth in nude mice compared with the control transfectants. More importantly, the increased expression of LMO3 and HEN2 was significantly associated with a poor prognosis in 87 primary neuroblastomas. These results suggest that the deregulated expression of neuronal-specific LMO3 and HEN2 contributes to the genesis and progression of human neuroblastoma in a lineage-specific manner.","['Aoyama, Mineyoshi', 'Ozaki, Toshinori', 'Inuzuka, Hiroyuki', 'Tomotsune, Daihachiro', 'Hirato, Junko', 'Okamoto, Yoshiaki', 'Tokita, Hisashi', 'Ohira, Miki', 'Nakagawara, Akira']","['Aoyama M', 'Ozaki T', 'Inuzuka H', 'Tomotsune D', 'Hirato J', 'Okamoto Y', 'Tokita H', 'Ohira M', 'Nakagawara A']","['Division of Biochemistry, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO3 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '148025-11-0 (NHLH2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogenes/physiology', 'Transfection']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/11/4587 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4630 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Jun 1;65(11):4587-97. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4630.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Akt (protein kinase B) kinase is a key player in transduction of antiapoptotic and proliferative signals in T cells. Because Tal1 has a putative Akt phosphorylation site at Thr90, we investigated whether Akt regulates Tal1. Our results show that Akt specifically phosphorylates Thr90 of the Tal1 protein within its transactivation domain in vitro and in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed the presence of Tal1 in Akt immune complexes, suggesting that Tal1 and Akt physically interact. We further showed that phosphorylation of Tal1 by Akt causes redistribution of Tal1 within the nucleus. Using luciferase assay, we showed that phosphorylation of Tal1 by Akt decreased repressor activity of Tal1 on EpB42 (P4.2) promoter. Thus, these data indicate that Akt interacts with Tal1 and regulates Tal1 by phosphorylation at Thr90 in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner.","['Palamarchuk, Alexey', 'Efanov, Alexey', 'Maximov, Vadim', 'Aqeilan, Rami I', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Pekarsky, Yuri']","['Palamarchuk A', 'Efanov A', 'Maximov V', 'Aqeilan RI', 'Croce CM', 'Pekarsky Y']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Transfection']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/11/4515 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0751 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Jun 1;65(11):4515-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0751.,,['CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite durable responses in most chronic phase patients, relapses have been observed and are much more prevalent in patients with advanced disease. The most common mechanism of acquired imatinib resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations with decreased imatinib sensitivity. Thus, alternate Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors that have activity against imatinib-resistant mutants would be useful for patients who relapse on imatinib therapy. Two such Bcr-Abl inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials: the improved potency, selective Abl inhibitor AMN107 and the highly potent dual Src/Abl inhibitor BMS-354825. In the current article, we compared imatinib, AMN107, and BMS-354825 in cellular and biochemical assays against a panel of 16 kinase domain mutants representing >90% of clinical isolates. We report that AMN107 and BMS-354825 are 20-fold and 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl and that similar improvements are maintained for all imatinib-resistant mutants tested, with the exception of T315I.

Anthracycline-treated childhood cancer survivors frequently have reduced left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and contractility, and GH therapy may affect these factors. METHODS: We examined serial cardiac findings for 34 anthracycline-treated childhood cancer survivors with several years of GH therapy and baseline cardiac z scores similar to those of a comparison group (86 similar cancer survivors without GH therapy). RESULTS: LV contractility was decreased among GH-treated patients before, during, and after GH therapy (-1.08 SD below the age-adjusted population mean before therapy and -1.88 SD 4 years after therapy ceased, with each value depressed below normal). Contractility was higher in the control group than in the GH-treated group, with this difference being nearly significant. The GH-treated children had thinner LV walls before GH therapy (-1.38 SD). Wall thickness increased during GH therapy (from -1.38 SD to -1.09 SD after 3 years of GH therapy), but the effect was lost shortly after GH therapy ended and thickness diminished over time (-1.50 SD at 1 year after therapy and -1.96 SD at 4 years). During GH therapy, the wall thickness for the GH-treated group was greater than that for the control group; however, by 4 years after therapy, there was no difference between the GH-treated group and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: GH therapy among anthracycline-treated survivors of childhood cancer increased LV wall thickness, but the effect was lost after therapy was discontinued. The therapy did not affect the progressive LV dysfunction.","['Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Vlach, Sarah A', 'Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Schwartz, Marcy L', 'Colan, Steven D']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Vlach SA', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Sallan SE', 'Schwartz ML', 'Colan SD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Holtz Children's Hospital, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, USA. slipshultz@med.miami.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,"['0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Cardiovascular Agents)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '69PN84IO1A (Enalapril)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Body Height', 'Cardiovascular Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enalapril/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Heart Ventricles/pathology', 'Hemodynamics', 'Human Growth Hormone/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/chemically induced', 'Hypopituitarism/chemically induced/drug therapy/etiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Survivors', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/11/11 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['115/6/1613 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2004-1004 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2005 Jun;115(6):1613-22. doi: 10.1542/peds.2004-1004.,,"['CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL59837/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL69800/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since LIF activates STATs 1 and 3 in adipocytes, we examined the effects of LIF on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our studies clearly demonstrate that LIF treatment had minimal effects on adipocyte differentiation as judged by marker gene expression, but did inhibit triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation during adipogenesis. Acute treatment with LIF resulted in increased expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-delta (C/EBPdelta) mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, the upregulation of C/EBPdelta correlated with binding to three sites in the C/EBPdelta promoter by LIF-activated protein complexes that contained STAT1 and not STAT3. Chronic treatment with LIF resulted in decreased protein levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), but had no effect on the expression of other adipocyte marker proteins or on TAG levels in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. LIF had a small effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but did not cause insulin resistance following chronic treatment.

To better understand the risk benzene poses, we examined the effect of benzene exposure on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression in a population of shoe-factory workers with well-characterized occupational exposures using microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PBMC RNA was stabilized in the field and analyzed using a comprehensive human array, the U133A/B Affymetrix GeneChip set. A matched analysis of six exposed-control pairs was performed. A combination of robust multiarray analysis and ordering of genes using paired t-statistics, along with bootstrapping to control for a 5% familywise error rate, was used to identify differentially expressed genes in a global analysis. This resulted in a set of 29 known genes being identified that were highly likely to be differentially expressed. We also repeated these analyses on a smaller subset of 508 cytokine probe sets and found that the expression of 19 known cytokine genes was significantly different between the exposed and the control subjects. Six genes were selected for confirmation by real-time PCR, and of these, CXCL16, ZNF331, JUN, and PF4 were the most significantly affected by benzene exposure, a finding that was confirmed in a larger data set from 28 subjects. The altered expression was not caused by changes in the makeup of the PBMC fraction. Thus, microarray analysis along with real-time PCR confirmation reveals that altered expressions of CXCL16, ZNF331, JUN, and PF4 are potential biomarkers of benzene exposure.","['Forrest, Matthew S', 'Lan, Qing', 'Hubbard, Alan E', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Li, Guilan', 'Wu, Yen-Ying', 'Shen, Min', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Forrest MS', 'Lan Q', 'Hubbard AE', 'Zhang L', 'Vermeulen R', 'Zhao X', 'Li G', 'Wu YY', 'Shen M', 'Yin S', 'Chanock SJ', 'Rothman N', 'Smith MT']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL16 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL16)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (ZNF331 protein, human)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers', 'Chemokine CXCL16', 'Chemokines, CXC/biosynthesis/genetics', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, jun/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Platelet Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Scavenger/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Shoes']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.7635 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2005 Jun;113(6):801-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.7635.,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES0011896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES006721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1257610,,,,,,,,

We carried out a population-based case-control study including 790 incident cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and as many healthy controls, matched on age and sex. Maternal occupational exposure to solvents before and during pregnancy was estimated using the expert method, which involves chemists coding each individual's job for specific contaminants. Home exposure to solvents was also evaluated. The frequency of exposure to specific agents or mixtures was generally low. Results were generally similar for the period ranging from 2 years before pregnancy up to birth and for the pregnancy period alone. For the former period, the odds ratio (OR), adjusted for maternal age and sex, for any exposure to all solvents together was 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-1.40]. Increased risks were observed for specific exposures, such as to 1,1,1-trichloroethane (OR = 7.55; 95% CI, 0.92-61.97), toluene (OR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.01-3.47), and mineral spirits (OR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.05-3.14).

Risk did not increase with increasing exposure, except for alkanes, where a significant trend (p = 0.04) was observed. Home exposure was not associated with increased risk.

Clinical investigations have been completed or are under way to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bortezomib alone or in combination with chemotherapy in multiple myeloma, both at relapse and presentation, as well as in other cancer types. The antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, and antitumor activities of bortezomib result from proteasome inhibition and depend on the altered degradation of a host of regulatory proteins. Exposure to bortezomib has been shown to stabilize p21, p27, and p53, as well as the proapoptotic Bid and Bax proteins, caveolin-1, and inhibitor kappaB-alpha, which prevents activation of nuclear factor kappaB-induced cell survival pathways. Bortezomib also promoted the activation of the proapoptotic c-Jun-NH2 terminal kinase, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The anticancer effects of bortezomib as a single agent have been demonstrated in xenograft models of multiple myeloma, adult T-cell leukemia, lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic, head and neck, and colon cancer, and in melanoma. In these preclinical in vivo studies, bortezomib treatment resulted in decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as increased survival and tumor apoptosis. In several in vitro and/or in vivo cancer models, bortezomib has also been shown to enhance the antitumor properties of several antineoplastic treatments. Importantly, bortezomib was generally well tolerated and did not appear to produce additive toxicities when combined with other therapies in the dosing regimens used in these preclinical in vivo investigations. These findings provide a rationale for further clinical trials using bortezomib alone or in combination regimens with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or novel agents in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.","['Boccadoro, Mario', 'Morgan, Gareth', 'Cavenagh, Jamie']","['Boccadoro M', 'Morgan G', 'Cavenagh J']","['Section of Hematology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy. mario.boccadoro@unito.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2005/06/03 09:00,2005/06/03 09:01,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/03 09:01 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1475-2867-5-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-5-18 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2005 Jun 1;5(1):18. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-5-18.,,,20050601,,,PMC1164423,,,,,,,,

Therefore, various parameters are needed to classify this disease into subtypes, so that specific treatment approaches can be utilized effectively. The commonly used method for diagnosis and classification is based on FAB criteria using morphology and cytochemical stains. For some of the categories, immunophenotyping is necessary. The aim of present study is to determine the frequency of various sub types in acute myeloid leukemia using FAB criteria in our population. This will aid in the correct diagnosis of acute leukemia and hence proper management of the patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is descriptive case control study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital from January 1999 to December 2000. The total number of subjects was 116 that included both adults and children. The patients were diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow morphology using FAB classification. Cytochemistry was done in all cases, while immunophenotyping was considered only in those cases that were found to be problematic. RESULTS: Among 116 patients, 70 were males and 46 were females with male to female ratio 1.5:1. The age ranged between 6 months to 85 years with a mean age of 32 years. AML-M4 was the predominant French-American-British (FAB) subtype (36.2%) followed by M2 (30.25%), M3 (10.4%), M1 (8.7%), M0 (7.7%), M5a (3.5%), M5b (2.5%) and M6 (0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common FAB subtype observed in our study was Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) which is in accordance with studies reported from Saudia Arabia and a previous study reported from our institution. However,other national and international studies have reported Myeloblastic Leukemia with maturation (M2) as the predominant subtype of AML.","['Harani, Mahadev S', 'Adil, Salman Naseem', 'Shaikh, Mohammad Usman', 'Kakepoto, Ghulam Nabi', 'Khurshid, Mohammmad']","['Harani MS', 'Adil SN', 'Shaikh MU', 'Kakepoto GN', 'Khurshid M']","['Department Of Pathology & Microbiology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan']",2005/06/03 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/06/03 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2005 Jan-Mar;17(1):26-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median patient age was 8.5 years (range, 0.5-24 year). Cord blood (CB) was from unrelated donors in 25/26 cases. Median CB nucleated cell dose was 3.26e7/kg (range, 0.8-12.9). RESULTS: With median follow-up of 548 days, 16/26 patients (62%) are event-free survivors. Acute GVHD developed in 14/24 evaluable patients, reaching grade III-IV in 7 patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 10/22 evaluable patients. Multivariate analysis showed higher total nucleated cell dose per kilogram to be the strongest predictor of event-free survival.

When a pegylated ASNase (single infusion of 2,500 IU/m(2) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ASNase, Oncaspar) was introduced into the treatment protocols of the German Cooperative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (COALL) study group, this was accompanied by a drug monitoring programme measuring serum ASNase activity and asparagine (ASN) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 70 children. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-nine serum samples from 67 evaluable patients showed medians of ASNase activity of 1,189.5, 824.5, 310.5, 41 and 4 U/l on day 7 +/- 1, 14 +/- 1, 21 +/- 1, 28 +/- 1 and 35 +/- 1 respectively. One hundred eighty-four samples from 59 patients were evaluable for ASN concentrations in the CSF. The medians of ASN concentration were <0.2, 0.2, 0.9 and 3.2 microM on day 14 +/- 1, 21 +/- 1, 28 +/- 1 and 35 +/- 1 respectively. When relating CSF ASN levels to the serum ASNase activity measured on the same day, a median of 1.2 microM CSF ASN was associated with values of serum ASNase activity between > or =2.5 and <100 U/l. Serum ASNase activity values > or =100 U/l were associated with a median CSF ASN of <0.2 microM, with 13/27 samples being incompletely depleted. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment intensity achieved with PEG ASNase in the present study appears to be acceptable based on the surrogate of serum ASNase activity. However, the pharmacological objective of ASNase treatment, that is, complete CSF ASN depletion with an ASNase activity >100 U/l, was not ensured. Nevertheless, one must also be aware that the minimum ASN concentration required for leukaemic cell growth is yet to be established.","['Vieira Pinheiro, J P', 'Wenner, K', 'Escherich, G', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky, C', 'Wurthwein, G', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Boos, J']","['Vieira Pinheiro JP', 'Wenner K', 'Escherich G', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky C', 'Wurthwein G', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Boos J']","['University Hospital Muenster, Coordinating Centre for Clinical Trials (KKS), Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*blood/cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2005/06/02 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20406 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jan;46(1):18-25. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The similarities and differences between adult and childhood presentations of disease, and whether or not some subtypes of NHL and leukemia are the same or different disease entities, are interesting questions that will be addressed with advances in our understanding of the molecular and genetic bases of these diseases.

The outcome of these infections depends significantly on the overall state of immunosuppression, including mainly the phagocytic system (neutrophils and macrophages). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), granulocyte-colony--stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony--stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are cytokines that enhance the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. METHODS: The authors reported 4 patients with leukemia and refractory invasive candidiasis or trichosporonosis despite 1-13 months of appropriate antifungal treatment. RESULTS: Cytokines were administered for 1.5-5 months without significant toxicity. For each patient, initiation of interferon-gamma plus a colony-stimulating factor resulted in a clinical response. The contribution of cytokines to control the fungal infection in these 4 patients was suggested by the strong inflammatory reaction observed in the 2 patients who had an immediate response (within 7 days of initiation of cytokine therapy) and by the good outcome in the 2 other patients in whom antifungal agents were discontinued at the start of cytokine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested a potential role for immunomodulation in patients with leukemia with refractory invasive fungal infections.","['Dignani, M Cecilia', 'Rex, John H', 'Chan, Ka-Wah', 'Dow, Gordon', 'deMagalhaes-Silverman, Margarida', 'Maddox, AnneMarie', 'Walsh, Thomas', 'Anaissie, Elias']","['Dignani MC', 'Rex JH', 'Chan KW', 'Dow G', 'deMagalhaes-Silverman M', 'Maddox A', 'Walsh T', 'Anaissie E']","['Division of Supportive Care, Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy']",2005/06/02 09:00,2005/08/23 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21142 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jul 1;104(1):199-204. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21142.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 12 hr on methylprednisolone, his symptoms disappeared with eventual resolution radiologically. Acute graft-versus-host disease of the lung is a very uncommon complication after stem cell transplant, but it should be considered in patients who are at high risk for graft-versus-host disease or developing symptoms soon after discontinuing immunosuppression.

We examined 10 years of data (1993-2002) from the New Zealand Cancer Registry to determine if there are ethnic differences in leukemia incidence in New Zealand, and we relate this to availability of stem-cell transplantation. We found that New Zealand Asians have a generally lower incidence of all leukemias investigated. New Zealand Maori have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (RR 1.5 in the age group 25-49 and RR 1.31 in the age group 50-74), relative to New Zealand Caucasians. New Zealand Pacific Islanders have an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia (RR 2.13 in the age group 25-49 and RR 1.52 in the age group 50-74). Stem-cell transplantation is a standard curative treatment for ages 25-49, and current opinion is extending the acceptable age up to age 60, in certain cases. We conclude that, among New Zealand Maori and New Zealand Pacific Islanders, there is an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia in age groups suitable for stem-cell transplantation. However, both of these ethnic groups have previously been shown to have a reduced chance of finding a 6/6-matched unrelated donor on international registries.

In the other patient, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, systemic relapse occurred when he was still on immunosuppression 6 months after SCT from an unrelated donor. After induction chemotherapy following cessation of immunosuppression, the BM examination proved CR. During consolidation chemotherapy, however, he developed leukemic dissemination in the CSF, despite the fact that the BM was in CR. Chimerism status in the BM mononuclear cells and fractionated peripheral blood (PB) cells (granulocytes, T-lymphocytes, and the others) was assessed by short tandem repeat analysis. In both patients, the BM cells and all the fractions of the PB cells proved donor-type chimeras.

In order to characterize the role of PKC in CLL, we investigated the expression pattern of PKC isoforms in CLL cells (7 cases) and evaluated the effect of PKC inhibition on the survival of CLL cells (20 cases). Expression of the classical PKC isoforms beta and gamma, the novel isoform delta and the atypical isoform zeta was seen in all analyzed patient samples by Western blot analysis. Expression of the PKC isoforms alpha, epsilon, and iota was variable. Following incubation with the PKC inhibitor, safingol, CLL cells underwent marked apoptosis in all cases. In order to characterize the molecular events associated with the apoptotic effect of PKC inhibition, gene expression patterns in CLL cells were evaluated by cDNA-microarray analysis. Following safingol treatment, several genes showed marked downregulation and PKC-related proteins demonstrated decreased hybridization signals. Among these proteins, CREB and Daxx were further studied by using Western blotting, nuclear binding assay and confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. These studies showed significant inhibition of these proteins, consistent with the results of microarray gene analysis. Overall, these findings suggest that PKC activation is important for CLL cell survival and that inhibitors of PKC may have a role in the treatment of patients with CLL.","['Alkan, Serhan', 'Huang, Qin', 'Ergin, Melek', 'Denning, Mitchell F', 'Nand, Sucha', 'Maududi, Tazeen', 'Paner, Gladell P', 'Ozpuyan, Fulya', 'Izban, Keith F']","['Alkan S', 'Huang Q', 'Ergin M', 'Denning MF', 'Nand S', 'Maududi T', 'Paner GP', 'Ozpuyan F', 'Izban KF']","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA.

These processes are closely intertwined. Under normal circumstances, hematopoietic cell proliferation and cell death are carefully balanced. Induction of differentiation is associated with a loss of proliferative capacity, and cell death accompanies hematopoietic cell maturation. Leukemic transformations can be related to dysregulation of each of these processes. Considerable evidence supports the notion that leukemias are likely to arise from the disruption of the differentiation process of hematopoietic progenitors, which fail to give birth to blood cells with restricted phenotypes, as well as from diminished ability to undergo apoptosis. Main results supporting such mechanisms have been obtained from studying bone marrow and analyzing the differentiation process of the human K562 and HL-60 and mouse MEL leukemic cell lines. This paper reviews the current concepts of how understanding the mechanisms of action of differentiation-inducing agents may contribute to the development of less toxic strategies to control growth and apoptosis of human cancer cells. Furthermore, the identification of new approaches to induce erythroid differentiation and reactivate fetal globin genes is crucial for the development of potential therapeutic agents in hematological disorders, including beta-thalassemia. The natural/synthetic agents inducing differentiation of human erythroleukemia K562 cells are presented.","['Czyz, Malgorzata', 'Szulawska, Agata']","['Czyz M', 'Szulawska A']","['Zaklad Chemii Medycznej Uniwersytetu Medycznego, Lodz. mczyz@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice']",2005/06/02 09:00,2006/04/11 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['7243 [pii]'],ppublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2005 Mar 22;59:82-97.,168,,,,,,,,,Indukowane roznicowanie komorek bialaczkowych linii K562.,,,,

Bupropion is a commonly used generic antidepressant in clinical use for over a decade, and early evidence indicates it lowers TNF levels.

Literature is not available on harmful effects of radiation therapy for tuberculosis of the spine. METHODS: Clinical case analysis for initial misdiagnosis and mistreatment, analysis of subsequent clinical course. RESULTS: Two patients received radiotherapy on spinal lesions of suspected malignant origin. In both patients, the lesions were of tuberculous origin and the lesions increased during radiotherapy. In Case 2, the paraplegia did not heal. CONCLUSION: In cases of a spinal lesion of unknown origin, tuberculosis should always be considered. Adequate biopsy for cultures and histology is mandatory.

We previously showed that selected human glioma cell lines also express functional FPR. We therefore investigated the relationship between FPR expression and the biologic behavior of glioma cells. METHODS: Expression and function of FPR in the human glioblastoma cell line U-87 were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chemotaxis assays, respectively. FPR protein expression was detected in specimens from 33 human primary gliomas by immunohistochemistry. FPR short interfering (si) RNA was used to block FPR expression in U-87 cells. Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring DNA synthesis. Xenograft tumor formation and growth were measured in nude mice. Endogenous FPR agonist activity released by necrotic tumor cells was assessed by measuring FPR activation in an FPR-transfected basophil leukemia cell line and live U-87 cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR, and VEGF protein was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: FPR was selectively expressed by the highly malignant human glioblastoma cell line U-87 and most primary grade IV glioblastomas multiforme and grade III anaplastic astrocytomas. U-87 cells responded to the FPR agonist fMLF by chemotaxis (i.e., increased motility), increased cell proliferation, and increased production of VEGF protein. FPR siRNA substantially reduced the tumorigenicity of U-87 cells in nude mice (38 days after implantation, mean tumor volume from wild-type U-87 cells = 842 mm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 721 to 963 mm3; and from FPR-siRNA transfected U-87 cells = 225 mm3, 95% CI = 194 to 256 mm3; P = .001). Necrotic glioblastoma cells released a factor(s) that activated FPR in live U-87 cells. CONCLUSIONS: FPR is expressed by highly malignant human glioma cells and appears to mediate motility, growth, and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma by interacting with host-derived agonists. Thus, FPR may represent a molecular target for the development of novel antiglioma therapeutics.","['Zhou, Ye', 'Bian, Xiuwu', 'Le, Yingying', 'Gong, Wanghua', 'Hu, Jinyue', 'Zhang, Xia', 'Wang, Lihua', 'Iribarren, Pablo', 'Salcedo, Rosalba', 'Howard, O M Zack', 'Farrar, William', 'Wang, Ji Ming']","['Zhou Y', 'Bian X', 'Le Y', 'Gong W', 'Hu J', 'Zhang X', 'Wang L', 'Iribarren P', 'Salcedo R', 'Howard OM', 'Farrar W', 'Wang JM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, CCR, NCI-Frederick, Building 560, Room 31-40, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemotaxis', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis']",2005/06/02 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['97/11/823 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/dji142 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Jun 1;97(11):823-35. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dji142.,,['N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations in PTPN11 occur in 35% of patients with de novo, nonsyndromic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), either transient or more fulminant forms, can also occur in infants with NS (NS/MPD). We identified PTPN11 mutations in blood or bone marrow specimens from 77 newly reported patients with JMML (n = 69) or NS/MPD (n = 8). Together with previous reports, we compared the spectrum of PTPN11 mutations in 3 groups: (1) patients with JMML (n = 107); (2) patients with NS/MPD (n = 19); and (3) patients with NS (n = 243).

NK cells also regulate DC physiology by killing immature DCs (iDCs), thus limiting inflammation and inappropriate T-lymphocyte tolerization. In a previous study, we have reported that NK cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML-NK cells) have deficient natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) expression. Herein, we analyzed the consequences of such a defect regarding the regulatory role of AML-NK cells in DC physiology. We show that NK cells display poor cytolytic capacities against DCs derived from healthy donor monocytes or derived from autologous leukemic blasts. These data point to a novel defect in the regulation of adaptive immune responses initiated by DCs in AML patients.

In this paper we describe the molecular characterization of a member of the Jumonji domain 2 (JMJD2) family of proteins, and demonstrate its binding to both class I HDACs and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). JMJD2 proteins are characterized by the presence of two leukemia-associated protein/plant homeodomain (LAP/PHD) zinc fingers, one JmjN, one JmjC (containing an internal retinoblastoma-binding protein 2 (RBBP2)-like sequence), and two Tudor domains. The first member of this group, JMJD2A, is widely expressed in human tissues and cell lines, and high endogenous expression of JMJD2A mRNA was found in several cell types, including human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cell lines. JMJD2A and JMJD2B exhibit cell type-specific responses to the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. We show that the JMJD2A protein associates in vivo with pRb and class I HDACs, and mediates repression of E2F-regulated promoters. In HTLV-1 virus-infected cells, we find that JMJD2A binds to the viral Tax protein. Antibodies to JMJD2A recognize the native protein but also a half-sized protein fragment, the latter up-regulated in THP-1 cells during the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The ability of JMJD2A to associate with pRb and HDACs and potentiate pRb-mediated repression of E2F-regulated promoters implies an important role for this protein in cell proliferation and oncogenesis.","['Gray, Steven G', 'Iglesias, Antonio H', 'Lizcano, Fernando', 'Villanueva, Raul', 'Camelo, Sandra', 'Jingu, Hisaka', 'Teh, Bin T', 'Koibuchi, Noriyuki', 'Chin, William W', 'Kokkotou, Efi', 'Dangond, Fernando']","['Gray SG', 'Iglesias AH', 'Lizcano F', 'Villanueva R', 'Camelo S', 'Jingu H', 'Teh BT', 'Koibuchi N', 'Chin WW', 'Kokkotou E', 'Dangond F']","[""Laboratory of Transcriptional and Immune Regulation, Brigham and Women's Hospital Laboratories, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM4B protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM4A protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Library', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases', 'Liver/embryology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2005/06/02 09:00,2005/10/13 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)56551-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M413687200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Aug 5;280(31):28507-18. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M413687200.

However, only little is known about how these factors are involved in the mechanisms of hematopoietic development and lineage commitment.

All BCP-leukemia cell lines were found to be positive for the expression of AML1, C/EBPgamma, E2A, Ets-1, IRF-1, Pax5 and PU.1 at the mRNA level. The mRNA expression of C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, C/EBPepsilon, GATA-2, Ikaros, T-bet and TCF-1 was detected in 2 to 29 of the cell lines. Eight BCP-cell lines showed positivity for the dominant negative Ikaros isoform Ik6, while others were positive for expression of Ik1, 2, 3 and 4. GATA-1 and GATA-3 were universally negative. The expression of C/EBPalpha, PU.1 and T-bet was positive at the protein level in five, 29 and four out of 30 BCP-cell lines, respectively. Cell lines were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-7 and/or interferon (IFN)-gamma to investigate the regulation of TF expression. T-bet was clearly induced in the two cell lines NALM-19 and NALM-29 after stimulation. C/EBPbeta and IRF-1 were up-regulated in both cell lines and TCF-1 was down-regulated in NALM-19.

However, very few data are available on the possible cytotoxic effect of TNFalpha produced by B-CLL cells. This study investigated whether B-CLL cells exert in vitro cytotoxicity by TNFalpha and if so, whether this cytotoxicity can be modulated by cytokines. In 8 of 12 patients (66.6%), B-CLL cells in vitro constitutively produced TNFalpha and exerted a TNFalpha-mediated cytotoxicity, evaluated in an 18-h 51Cr release assay, against the TNFalpha-sensitive Jurkat, U937 and K562 cell lines but not against the TNFalpha-resistant Raji cell line. Involvement of TNFalpha in B-CLL cell cytotoxicity is demonstrated by the fact that anti-TNFalpha antibodies strongly inhibited it and supernatants of cytotoxic cultures contained TNFalpha and mediated a completely TNFalpha-dependent cytotoxicity. When the cytotoxic B-CLL cells were stimulated with interleukin (IL)-2 plus IL-12, there was increased TNFalpha mRNA expression, TNFalpha production and TNFalpha-mediated cytotoxicity. All eight patients with cytotoxic leukemic cells had progressive disease and six of these also expressed high levels of ZAP-70 protein. In the other four patients (33.3%), B-CLL cells did not produce TNFalpha in vitro and were not cytotoxic, either spontaneously or after IL-2 plus IL-12 stimulation. Of these four patients, three had stable disease and one had progressive disease. The patient with progressive disease and one of the three with stable disease expressed low levels of ZAP-70 protein.

Although the increase in cellular accumulation followed a time course similar to apoptotic manifestations induced by these drugs, the two phenomena seem independent. There was no correlation between the levels of MDR reversal and apoptosis in clones derived from the K562 cell line. Moreover, whereas protein kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis in only a fraction of the cells, the MDR reversal occurred in all of them.

DAC mediated hypomethylation of p57KIP2 was not required to induce p57KIP2 gene expression, and treatment with DAC resulted in the induction of p21CIP1. VPA induced global histone acetylation, an effect enhanced by the addition of DAC.

Additionally, the VH gene repertoire was not skewed in LPL/WM as has been demonstrated in other B cell malignancies.","['Walsh, Sarah H', 'Laurell, Anna', 'Sundstrom, Gunnel', 'Roos, Goran', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Walsh SH', 'Laurell A', 'Sundstrom G', 'Roos G', 'Sundstrom C', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/blood/*genetics']",2005/06/02 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2004/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00035-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Jul;29(7):729-34. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.12.008.

IM-9 human lymphoblasts (2 x 10(4) cells/cm2) were seeded into tissue culture plates and incubated with five kinds of statins. Statin-treated cells were first incubated with biotin-annexin V, followed by addition of avidin-FITC and propidium iodide, and then subjected to flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensity was enhanced using an avidin-biotin complex system, resulting in successful separate determination of the statin-induced apoptosis and necrosis by flow cytometry, which enabled us to quantitatively evaluate the statin-induced cell damage. Flow cytometric analysis results in the intensity of statin-induced apoptosis in IM-9 cells as follows: atorvastatin cerivastatin>fluvastatin simvastatin>pravastatin. The intensity of statin-induced necrosis in IM-9 cells was expressed as follows: atorvastatin cerivastatin>fluvastatin simvastatin>pravastatin. The total damage of IM-9 cells induced by five kinds of statins were expressed as the sum of both percentages of apoptosis and necrosis as follows: atorvastatin cerivastatin>fluvastatin simvastatin>pravastatin. Our studies show that fluorescence enhancement with avidin-biotin complex is useful for the identification and quantitation of annexin-positive apoptosis cells and thus, the fluorescence-enhanced flow cytometry was shown to be applicable for screening of statins as new anti-leukemia agents.","['Yasuda, Noriko', 'Matzno, Sumio', 'Iwano, Chihiro', 'Nishikata, Mayumi', 'Matsuyama, Kenji']","['Yasuda N', 'Matzno S', 'Iwano C', 'Nishikata M', 'Matsuyama K']","[""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mukogawa Women's University, 11-68 Koshien, Kyuban-cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 663-8179, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Biomed Anal,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,8309336,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '4L066368AS (Fluvastatin)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)', 'AM91H2KS67 (cerivastatin)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'KXO2KT9N0G (Pravastatin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Atorvastatin', 'Avidin/chemistry', 'Biotin/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/pharmacology', 'Fluvastatin', 'Heptanoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', '*Necrosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/analysis', 'Pravastatin/pharmacology', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Simvastatin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/02 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2004/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0731-7085(05)00256-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpba.2005.04.022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2005 Sep 15;39(3-4):712-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jpba.2005.04.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gingerdione is one of the components from ginger. In the present study, we found that I6 could inhibit cell proliferation in the time- and dose-dependent manner in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. To investigate the anti-proliferation mechanism of I6, cell cycle analysis was performed. Results showed that I6 induced significant G1 arrest and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. It was proved by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of regulatory on G1 arrest that the levels of p15 and p27 increased after treatment and mRNA levels of cyclin D2, cyclin E, and cdc25A were decreased. The I6-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by DNA fragmentation assay. The DNA gel electrophoresis showed that I6 induced DNA fragmentation, a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis, in HL-60 cells. I6-induced apoptosis was accompanied by an apparent up-regulation of caspase-3, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Taken together, these results suggest that markedly down-regulation of G1 associated cyclin D2, cyclin E and cdc25A and up-regulation of CDKI, p15 and p27, and may contribute to I6-mediated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the Bcl-2 expression decrease and caspase-3 activation may be the plausible mechanism by which I6 induced apoptosis. These results suggest that I6 is a potent anti-HL-60 drug and possess a significant action on cell cycle before commitment for apoptosis occurrence.","['Hsu, Mei-Hua', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu', 'Chen, Chun-Jen', 'Chung, Jing-Gung', 'Lai, Ya-Yun', 'Huang, Li-Jiau']","['Hsu MH', 'Kuo SC', 'Chen CJ', 'Chung JG', 'Lai YY', 'Huang LJ']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Ginger/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2005/06/02 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2004/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00180-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Dec;29(12):1399-406. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.014.

Of 53 patients, 45 received multiagent induction chemotherapy using a variety of regimens. There were 13 BCR-ABL positive patients, 9 of who received imatinib mesylate, either during induction or post-remission therapy. The overall complete remission (CR) rate of all 45-induction patients was 56%, with a 27% induction-related mortality rate. The CR rate was not influenced by induction regimen, age, initial WBC, LDH or BCR-ABL status. The median overall survival of the induction patients was 9 months, while the median progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients achieving CR was 10 months. The estimated overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 18.4% (95% CI: 9.8-34.3%). Age and initial WBC did not significantly predict for OS when evaluating the entire group of induction patients. However, there was a strong trend for BCR-ABL status to favorably predict for PFS, and for OS when only patients treated after July 2000 (when imatinib became available) were evaluated. The results indicate that ALL remains a poor prognosis disease in elderly patients, and that aggressive induction regimens designed for younger patients are very toxic for these patients. These data suggest that BCR-ABL+ ALL is becoming a relatively more favorable prognosis disease in the elderly, likely due to the influence of imatinib therapy. Further regimens should explore the use of less aggressive regimens in elderly patients and should evaluate the optimal way of combining imatinib with conventional agents in BCR-ABL+ patients.","['Brandwein, J M', 'Gupta, V', 'Wells, R A', 'Schuh, A C', 'Schimmer, A D', 'Lipton, J H', 'Messner, H A', 'Yi, Q-L', 'Chun, K', 'Kamel-Reid, S', 'Minden, M D']","['Brandwein JM', 'Gupta V', 'Wells RA', 'Schuh AC', 'Schimmer AD', 'Lipton JH', 'Messner HA', 'Yi QL', 'Chun K', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ont., Canada. joseph.brandwein@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/06/02 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/06/02 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00184-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Dec;29(12):1381-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.020.

In this study, we compared the long-term effects of dexamethasone and prednisolone on bone mineral density (BMD), body composition and growth in long-term survivors of ALL in first complete remission. PROCEDURE: Ninety patients (51 male, 49 female; 8.6-38.5 year), treated with either a prednisolone containing protocol (n = 47; n = 19 also with CNS-irradiation) or a dexamethasone containing protocol (n = 43; no cranial irradiation) participated in this cross-sectional single center study. Mean follow-up was 12.7 years (2.0-29.7 years). BMD of lumbar spine and total body, and body composition were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone mineral apparent density of the lumbar spine (BMAD) was calculated to correct for bone size. RESULTS: There was no difference in height, height corrected for target height, BMD, or lean body mass between prednisolone and dexamethasone treated patients. Prednisolone treated patients had an increased percentage body fat (SDS +0.46; P < 0.05) and increased body mass index (SDS 0.88; P < 0.01) compared to normal. Dexamethasone treated patients had only an increased body mass index (SDS 0.52; P < 0.05). Height, total body BMD, and lean body mass were lower in patients treated with cranial irradiation as compared to non-irradiated patients, but differences in the latter two disappeared when corrected for height. BMAD was normal after CNS-irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Long term survivors of ALL treated with prednisolone or dexamethasone containing regimens do not differ in height, BMD, or body composition.","['van Beek, Robert D', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama, Sabine M P F', 'Hakvoort-Cammel, Friederike G', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Krenning, Eric P', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['van Beek RD', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama SM', 'Hakvoort-Cammel FG', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Krenning EP', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Body Composition', 'Bone Density/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fractures, Bone/epidemiology', 'Growth/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Regression Analysis', '*Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",2005/06/01 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20437 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jan;46(1):88-93. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20437.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvements in event-free survival (EFS) have been attributed to lower CNS relapse rates, However, there are concerns that dexamethasone may be more toxic than previous conventional therapy with prednisone. Such toxicity raises questions about the implications for child neuropsychological function and HRQOL. Patients participating in the UK ALL 99/01 trial were randomized to receive dexamethasone or prednisone as their steroid in induction and maintenance chemotherapy. We compared the HRQOL and behavior in children randomized to receive both these agents. PROCEDURE: Standardized questionnaires to assess parent and child HRQOL at 3-6 months after diagnosis (T1) and 1 year later (T2) completed by mothers in family homes. Forty-five mothers of a child with ALL (32 male, 13 female; average age at T1, 7 years 3 months; at T2, 8 years 3 months) completed HRQOL questionnaires. RESULTS: For the total group, child HRQOL scores improved and behavior problems decreased significantly from T1 to T2. Comparison of HRQOL scores between the 17 children randomized to dexamethasone and 28 children randomized to prednisone showed no significant differences. The rate of improvement in HRQOL from T1 to T2 did not differ between children randomized to dexamethasone or prednisone. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone is increasingly used in the treatment of ALL and has been linked with improved survival rates. Long-term use of dexamethasone raises questions about neuropsychologic toxicity. Although HRQOL increased significantly over the year for all children, the extent of this increase did not differ by chemotherapy. These results should contribute to lessened concerns about use of dexamethasone in the treatment of ALL.","['Eiser, Christine', 'Davies, Helena', 'Jenney, Meriel', 'Stride, Chris', 'Glaser, Adam']","['Eiser C', 'Davies H', 'Jenney M', 'Stride C', 'Glaser A']","['Cancer Research UK Professor of Child Health Psychology, Child and Family Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield, United Kingdom. c.eiser@shef.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mental Health', 'Mothers/psychology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Social Adjustment', 'United Kingdom']",2005/06/01 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20432 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jan;46(1):35-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20432.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mammalian cochlear outer hair cells (OHC) possess a distinct motile property, dubbed membrane-based electromotility, that enhances the receptor function. This electromotility is believed to be the basis of cochlear amplification that increases sensitivity of the mammalian ear to sound. Prestin, a unique voltage-sensitive motor molecule localized in the lateral membrane of OHC, is presumably responsible for OHC electromotility. It has been documented that prestin null-animals lack electromotility and suffer from approximately 50 dB loss of hearing sensitivity. To identify proteins that interact with prestin we carried out a yeast two-hybrid library screen using the C-terminal intracellular domain of prestin as bait. Seven bait-dependent prey clones were identified independently. Further analysis revealed that they encode partially over-lapping regions of a single protein: a transcriptional repressor, promyleocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). PLZF encodes a POZ/domain Kruppel-type zinc finger transcription factor reported to have pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative activity. The interaction between endogenous prestin and PLZF proteins in the cochlea was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using organ of Corti lysates. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that PLZF co-localizes with prestin near the lateral membrane of cochlear OHC. The physiological significance of this interaction remains to be explored.","['Nagy, Ivana', 'Bodmer, Morana', 'Schmid, Stephan', 'Bodmer, Daniel']","['Nagy I', 'Bodmer M', 'Schmid S', 'Bodmer D']","['Inner Ear Research Laboratory, ENT Department, University Hospital Zurich, NORD2 Frauenklinikstr. 24, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.

The bone marrow cells (1 x 10(7)) were mixed with the spleen cells (1 x 10(7)), which were camouflaged or not camouflaged with mPEG, were transplanted into irradiated leukemia mice in C and D groups. GVL effects were assessed by L615 cells proportion in peripheral blood, histopathological changes and survival time. RESULTS: Severe GVHD was observed in group C (without mPEG modification), and the mice rapidly died, the mean survival time was 6.9 days. The mice in irradiated group (group B) with leukemia cell died of leukemia. The average survival time of group D (with mPEG modification) was 24.2 days, which was longer than that of the other groups (P < 0.05), and the survival rate of group D (27%) was significantly higher than that of the others (P < 0.05), 11 mice (11/15) died of leukemia and the others were still alive. CONCLUSION: The camouflage with mPEG modification is capable of preserving GVL effect and preventing GVHD in mice BMT.","['Long, Hui', 'Tang, Suo-qin', 'Zhang, Xiao-fei']","['Long H', 'Tang SQ', 'Zhang XF']","[""Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100853, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9004-74-4 (monomethoxypolyethylene glycol)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology']",2005/06/01 09:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2005 May;43(5):377-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known to all that the pathogenesis and development of leukemia are related to a variety of genes. Survivin is a member of inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAP). Its cDNA was cloned from target cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1). It is expressed in common tumors, but there is no expression in normal and mature tissues. High expression of survivin was detected in leukemic cells. The present study was conducted to examine the role of survivin in the differentiation of leukemic cells by using antisense-oligonucleotides. METHODS: Human leukemic cell K562 was used as the model for the study. K562 cells were divided into 4 groups randomly: antisense oligonucleuotide (ASON) group, nonsense oligonucleotide (NSON) group, lipofectin group and control group. There were 5 samples in each group, and the experiment was repeated for three times. ASON was designed with the reference to targeting survivin mRNA. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 contained fetal cattle serum at a concentration of about 10 percent. Cell transfection was induced by lipofectin. Forty-eight hours after thansfection, the morphology and ultrastructure were observed. Twenty-four hours and 48 hours after thansfection, the function of K562 cells was detected by benzidine staining, POX staining and NBT staining, respectively. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD33 was determined by flow cytometry. The method of immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein level of survivin. RESULTS: After thansfection with ASON, the size of K562 cells was reduced, but the cytoplasm was increased. The metarubricyte, segment granulocyte, apoptotic cells could be found. Morphologically and ultrastructurally, erythroid and myelocytic differentiation was observed. The positive level of benzidine staining in ASON group (11.90 +/- 2.30 at 24 h and 18.20 +/- 2.93 at 48 h) was higher than that of NSON group, lipofectin group and control group, respectively. The positive level of POX staining in ASON group (17.40 +/- 3.54 at 24 h and 29.40 +/- 3.70 at 48 h) was also higher than that of any other groups. The positive level of NBT staining in ASON group (7.50 +/- 2.26 at 24 h and 12.10 +/- 2.63 at 48 h) was significantly higher than that of NSON group, lipofectin group and control group, respectively (P < 0.01). In ASON group, the mean fluorescence intensity of CD33 (21.43 +/- 1.61 at 24 h and 14.86 +/- 1.20 at 48 h) was significantly lower than that of any other groups (P < 0.01). After thansfection for 24 h, the protein level of survivin in ASON group was decreased significantly compared to that of control group. There was no difference in survivin protein level amongst ASON group, NSON group and lipofectin group at 24 h (P > 0.05). Forty-eight hours after thansfection, the protein level of survivin was decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: ASON targeting survivin can induce K562 to erythroid and myelocytic differentiation. Survivin is related to differentiation of K562 cells, and it can be a target of gene therapy for leukemia.","['Wen, Xian-hao', 'Xu, You-hua']","['Wen XH', 'Xu YH']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Survivin', 'Transfection']",2005/06/01 09:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Apr;43(4):279-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of a microscope for the selection of one nucleus from the nuclear preparation decreases the possibility of introduction of other subcellular components that are commonly found as impurities in subcellular fractions. The presence of SDS in the running buffer made negligible the DNA's quenching effect on DOX fluorescence, which often compromises quantification of DOX by direct imaging, making it possible to carry out the first direct measurement of the doxorubicin content of isolated nuclei. On average, nuclei from CCRF-CEM and CEM/C2 cell lines contained 85 +/-64 (n = 6) and 91 +/- 51 (n =7) amol of DOX, respectively.

OBSERVATION: Two patients underwent HSCT for acute leukemia. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed. At 5 years one patient developed squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and the other mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland. DISCUSSION: Several factors are involved in the development of secondary malignant tumors after HSCT. Pre- and post-graft immunosuppressive treatment inhibits the defence system and cell repair and can trigger chronic GVHD with chronic inflammation of the epithelial tissue leading to accelerated cell turn over and a risk of genetic anomalies favoring penetration of viral particles. Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity after HSCT presents the same clinical, histological and prognostic features as in the non-grafted patient. These patients require prolonged surveillance.

Some of them have been recognized as being opportunistic agents responsible for localized as well as generalized infections, especially in the case of malignant blood diseases. Their poor sensitivity to standard antifungal therapeutics makes them very dangerous. We report a case of cutaneous and systemic fusariosis due to Fusarium moniliforme in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CASE-REPORT: A 20 year-old male student was suffering from acute type 6 myeloblastic leukemia. During the second consolidation schedule with a combined therapy of aracytine and amsacrine, this patient whose food diet was exclusively based on cereals, showed evidence of febrile aplasia, associated with myalgia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Microbiological samples were sterile. Ten days later, we noted the appearance of painful, diffuse and purple dermohypodermal cutaneous nodules surrounded by an erythematous ring. Histological and microbiological examination of the hypodermis biopsies of the skin nodules revealed invasion by Fusarium moniliforme. Treatment with voriconazole in association with transfusions of leukocytes led to clinical and microbiological cure. DISCUSSION: In our case report, the clinical pattern starting with digestive symptoms suggested dissemination from a digestive site, which is very unusual in Europe. In our patient, the malnutrition, together with a diet exclusively based on contaminated cereals in a context of malignant hemopathy, resulted in the colonization of the digestive tract by these moulds and the aplasia-inducing chemotherapy schedules enhanced their pathogen potential.","['Karam, A', 'Eveillard, J-R', 'Ianoto, J-C', 'Quinio, D', 'Le Flohic, A-M', 'Le Roy, J-P', 'Misery, L', 'Berthou, C']","['Karam A', 'Eveillard JR', 'Ianoto JC', 'Quinio D', 'Le Flohic AM', 'Le Roy JP', 'Misery L', 'Berthou C']","['Service de Dermatologie, CHU de Brest.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Diet', 'Fusarium/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['MDOI-AD-03-2005-132-3-0151-9638-101019-200513137 [pii]', '10.1016/s0151-9638(05)79257-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2005 Mar;132(3):255-8. doi: 10.1016/s0151-9638(05)79257-7.,,,,,,,,,,Fusariose cutanee et viscerale disseminee chez un malade en aplasie: une porte d'entree digestive inhabituelle.,,,,

Appropriate transcriptional regulation is essential for the biological functions of SCL, and we have previously identified five distinct enhancers which target different subdomains of the normal SCL expression pattern. However, it is not known whether these SCL enhancers also regulate neighboring genes within the SCL locus, and the erythroid expression of SCL remains unexplained. Here, we have quantitated transcripts from SCL and neighboring genes in multiple hematopoietic cell types. Our results show striking coexpression of SCL and its immediate downstream neighbor, MAP17, suggesting that they share regulatory elements. A systematic survey of histone H3 and H4 acetylation throughout the SCL locus in different hematopoietic cell types identified several peaks of histone acetylation between SIL and MAP17, all of which corresponded to previously characterized SCL enhancers or to the MAP17 promoter. Downstream of MAP17 (and 40 kb downstream of SCL exon 1a), an additional peak of acetylation was identified in hematopoietic cells and was found to correlate with expression of SCL but not other neighboring genes. This +40 region is conserved in human-dog-mouse-rat sequence comparisons, functions as an erythroid cell-restricted enhancer in vitro, and directs beta-galactosidase expression to primitive, but not definitive, erythroblasts in transgenic mice. The SCL +40 enhancer provides a powerful tool for studying the molecular and cellular biology of the primitive erythroid lineage.","['Delabesse, E', 'Ogilvy, S', 'Chapman, M A', 'Piltz, S G', 'Gottgens, B', 'Green, A R']","['Delabesse E', 'Ogilvy S', 'Chapman MA', 'Piltz SG', 'Gottgens B', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Hematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2XY, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDZK1IP1 protein, human)', '0 (Pdzk1ip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pdzk1ip1 protein, rat)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology/physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/12/5215 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.12.5215-5225.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Jun;25(12):5215-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.12.5215-5225.2005.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,PMC1140604,,,,,,,,

In principle, sumoylation may either influence transcription factor activity on promoters, or it may act indirectly by targeting the modified factors to specific cellular compartments. To provide direct experimental evidence for the above, not necessarily mutually exclusive models, we analyzed the role of SUMO modification on the localization and the activity of the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1. We demonstrate, by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays, that sumoylated LRH-1 is exclusively localized in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies and that this association is a dynamic process. Release of LRH-1 from nuclear bodies correlated with its desumoylation, pointing to the pivotal role of SUMO conjugation in keeping LRH-1 in these locations. SUMO-dependent shuttling of LRH-1 into PML bodies defines two spatially separated pools of the protein, of which only the soluble, unmodified one is associated with actively transcribed target genes. The results suggest that SUMO-PML nuclear bodies may primarily function as dynamic molecular reservoirs, controlling the availability of certain transcription factors to active chromatin domains.","['Chalkiadaki, Angeliki', 'Talianidis, Iannis']","['Chalkiadaki A', 'Talianidis I']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, P.O.

Embryonic stem cell lines deficient for CGBP were generated to further examine CGBP function. CGBP(-)(/)(-) cells are viable but show an increased rate of apoptosis and are unable to achieve in vitro differentiation following removal of leukemia inhibitory factor from the growth media. Instead, CGBP(-)(/)(-) embryonic stem cells remain undifferentiated as revealed by persistent expression of the pluripotent markers Oct4 and alkaline phosphatase. CGBP(-)(/)(-) cells exhibit a 60 to 80% decrease in global cytosine methylation, including hypo-methylation of repetitive elements, single-copy genes, and imprinted genes. Total DNA methyltransferase activity is reduced by 30 to 60% in CGBP(-)(/)(-) cells, and expression of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 protein is similarly reduced. However, de novo DNA methyltransferase activity is normal. Nearly all aspects of the pleiotropic CGBP(-)(/)(-) phenotype are rescued by introduction of a CGBP expression vector. Hence, CGBP is essential for normal epigenetic modification of the genome by cytosine methylation and for cellular differentiation, consistent with the requirement for CGBP during early mammalian development.","['Carlone, Diana L', 'Lee, Jeong-Heon', 'Young, Suzanne R L', 'Dobrota, Erika', 'Butler, Jill Sergesketter', 'Ruiz, Joseph', 'Skalnik, David G']","['Carlone DL', 'Lee JH', 'Young SR', 'Dobrota E', 'Butler JS', 'Ruiz J', 'Skalnik DG']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cxxc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', '*CpG Islands', 'Cytosine/*metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fetal Viability', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/12/4881 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.12.4881-4891.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Jun;25(12):4881-91. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.12.4881-4891.2005.,,"['P01 HL069974/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL69974/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1140577,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (N=587) with untreated extensive SCLC were randomly assigned to receive either cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and etoposide 80 mg/m2 on days 1 through 3 administered every 3 weeks for six cycles (EP) or cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 4 hours on day 1, and etoposide 80 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 followed by recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on days 4 to 18 administered every 3 weeks for six cycles (PET). RESULTS: Reporting of demographics, response, and survival included 565 patients, of whom 282 were randomly assigned to receive EP and 283 were assigned to receive PET. Overall response rates were 68% for the EP arm and 75% for the PET arm. Median failure-free survival time was 5.9 months for the EP arm and 6 months for the PET arm (P = .179). Median overall survival time was 9.9 months for patients on EP and 10.6 months for patients on PET (P = .169). Toxic deaths occurred in 2.4% of the patients on EP and 6.5% of patients on PET. CONCLUSION: PET did not improve the time to progression or survival in patients with extensive SCLC compared with EP alone and was associated with unacceptable toxicity.","['Niell, Harvey B', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Miller, Antonius A', 'Watson, Dorothy M', 'Sandler, Alan B', 'Kelly, Karen', 'Marks, Randolph S', 'Perry, Micheal C', 'Ansari, Rafat H', 'Otterson, Grefory', 'Ellerton, John', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark R']","['Niell HB', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Miller AA', 'Watson DM', 'Sandler AB', 'Kelly K', 'Marks RS', 'Perry MC', 'Ansari RH', 'Otterson G', 'Ellerton J', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MR']","['University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN 31187, USA. hniell@utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/16/3752 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.09.071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 1;23(16):3752-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.09.071.,,"['U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group'],,

We used this data to compare childhood cancer survival time trends in Europe. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Survival in 44,129 children diagnosed under the age of 15 years during 1983 to 1994 was analyzed. Sex- and age-adjusted 5-year survival trends for 10 common cancers and for all cancers combined were estimated for five regions (West Germany, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Nordic countries, and West and South Europe) and Europe as a whole. Europe-wide trends for 14 rare cancers were estimated. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, 5-year survival increased from 65% for diagnoses in 1983 to 1985 to 75% in 1992 to 1994. Survival improved for all individual cancers except melanoma, osteosarcoma, and thyroid carcinoma; although for retinoblastoma, chondrosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma, improvements were not significant. The most marked improvements (50% to 66%) occurred in Eastern Europe. For common cancers, the greatest improvements were for leukemia and lymphomas, with risk of dying reducing significantly by 5% to 6% per year. Survival for CNS tumors improved significantly from 57% to 65%, with risk reducing by 3% per year. Risk reduced by 4% per year for neuroblastoma and 3% per year for Wilms' tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. The survival gap between regions reduced over the period, particularly for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, CNS tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma. For rare Burkitt's lymphoma, hepatoblastoma, gonadal germ cell tumors, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, risk reductions were at least 10% per year. CONCLUSION: These gratifying improvements in survival can often be plausibly related to advances in treatment. The prevalence of European adults with a history of childhood cancer will inevitably increase.","['Gatta, Gemma', 'Capocaccia, Riccardo', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Berrino, Franco', 'Terenziani, Monica']","['Gatta G', 'Capocaccia R', 'Stiller C', 'Kaatsch P', 'Berrino F', 'Terenziani M']","['Epidemiology Unit, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Via Venezian 1, 20133 Milano, Italy. gatta@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/16/3742 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.00.554 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 1;23(16):3742-51. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.00.554.,,,,,,,,,,,,['EUROCARE Working Group'],,

No correlation with CD34 expression by immunohistochemical analysis was seen. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) expression was detected in blasts in 17 AML cases (44%) and 21 ALL cases (78%). There was no correlation between WT1 and podocalyxin expression. We conclude that podocalyxin is expressed commonly by blasts in ALL and AML. Analysis of the expression of CD34 and podocalyxin increases sensitivity for the immunophenotypic detection of leukemic blasts compared with the analysis of CD34 alone. Therefore, podocalyxin seems to complement CD34 as a useful hematopoietic blast marker.

Previous studies using wild-type LAC and TAH181/57, a highly neurovirulent strain with low neuroinvasiveness (Janssen, R., Gonzalez-Scarano, F., Nathanson, N., 1984. Mechanisms of bunyavirus virulence. Comparative pathogenesis of a virulent strain of La Crosse and an avirulent strain of Tahyna virus. Lab. Invest. 50 (4), 447-455), have demonstrated that the neuroinvasive phenotype maps to the M segment, the segment that encodes the two viral glycoproteins Gn (G2) and Gc (G1), as well as a non-structural protein NSm. To further define the role of Gn and Gc in fusion and entry, we prepared a panel of recombinant M segment constructs using LAC, TAH181/57, and V22F, a monoclonal-resistant variant of LAC with deficient fusion function. These M segment constructs were then tested in two surrogate assays for virus entry: a cell-to-cell fusion assay based on T7-luciferase expression, and a pseudotype transduction assay based on the incorporation of the bunyavirus glycoproteins on an MLV backbone. Both assays demonstrated that Gc is the principal determinant of virus fusion and cell entry, and furthermore that the region delineated by amino acids 860-1442, corresponding to the membrane proximal two-thirds of Gc, is key to these processes. These results, coupled with structural modeling suggesting homologies between the carboxy region of Gc and Sindbis virus E1, suggest that the LAC Gc functions as a type II fusion protein.","['Plassmeyer, Matthew L', 'Soldan, Samantha S', 'Stachelek, Karen M', 'Martin-Garcia, Julio', 'Gonzalez-Scarano, Francisco']","['Plassmeyer ML', 'Soldan SS', 'Stachelek KM', 'Martin-Garcia J', 'Gonzalez-Scarano F']","['University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4283, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Encephalitis Virus, California/classification/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'La Crosse virus/classification/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Quail', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Virulence']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00233-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.04.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Jul 20;338(1):121-32. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.04.026.,,"['AI-07325/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-007180/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-30606/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Transduction by adenoviral vectors has been reported to induce efficient maturation of monocyte-derived DCs but AML cells are generally resistant to adenoviral gene transfer. In this study we tested the effects of adenoviral TNF-alpha gene transfer on maturation of AML cells using the fiber-modified AdTNF.F(pK7) adenovirus. All samples expressed high and sustained levels of TNF-alpha following transduction. AdTNF.F(pK7) induced significantly greater maturation of AML cells into antigen-presenting cells (APC) than did recombinant TNF-alpha or control adenoviral vector. Maturation of leukemic cells into APCs was mediated at least partially via a PI3K/mTOR pathway, as the inhibitors LY294002, wortmannin, and rapamycin inhibited the maturation effect induced by the AdTNF.F(pK7) adenovirus. In addition, CD8+ T cells expanded with AdTNF.F(pK7)-transduced AML cells showed greater expansion and specific CD8+ CTL activity against autologous AML cells than T cells expanded by other means. Thus, fiber-modified adenoviral vectors encoding TNF-alpha are able to maturate AML cells into APCs with high efficacy and reproducibility, providing a useful tool to generate efficiently specific CD8+ CTLs against leukemic disease.","['Saudemont, Aurore', 'Corm, Selim', 'Wickham, Thomas', 'Hetuin, Dominique', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Saudemont A', 'Corm S', 'Wickham T', 'Hetuin D', 'Quesnel B']","['Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, 59037 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (hexon capsid protein, Adenovirus)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2004/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(04)01593-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2004.12.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2005 Jun;11(6):950-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2004.12.016.

Eugenol-treated HL-60 cells displayed features of apoptosis including DNA fragmentation and formation of DNA ladders in agarose gel electrophoresis. We observed that eugenol transduced the apoptotic signal via ROS generation, thereby inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), reducing anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 level, inducing cytochrome c release to the cytosol, and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that ROS plays a critical role in eugenol-induced apoptosis in HL-60, and this is the first report on the mechanism of the anticancer effect of eugenol.","['Yoo, Chae-Bin', 'Han, Ki-Tae', 'Cho, Kyu-Seok', 'Ha, Joohun', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Nam, Jung-Hwan', 'Kil, Uk-Hyun', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Yoo CB', 'Han KT', 'Cho KS', 'Ha J', 'Park HJ', 'Nam JH', 'Kil UH', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, Hoegi-Dong, Seoul 130-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3T8H1794QW (Eugenol)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Damage', 'Eugenol/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry', 'Permeability', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syzygium/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2004/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00878-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2005 Jul 8;225(1):41-52. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.11.018.

The complexes were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of lanthanum (III) salt to an aqueous solution of the ligand subsequently raising the pH of the mixture gradually to ca. 5.0 by adding dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. The lanthanum (III) complexes with bis-coumarins were characterized by different physicochemical methods-elemental analysis, IR-, (1)H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopies and mass-spectral data. The spectral data of lanthanum (III) complexes were interpreted on the basis of comparison with the spectra of the free ligands. This analysis showed that in the La (III) complexes the ligands coordinated to the metal ion through both deprotonated hydroxyl groups. On the basis of the nu(C=O) red shift observed, participation of the carbonyl groups in the coordination to the metal ion was also suggested. Cytotoxic screening by MTT assay was carried out. In the present study, we performed comparative evaluation of the cytotoxic effects of the three newly synthesized lanthanum complexes against the acute myeloid leukemia derived HL-60 and the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived BV-173. In addition the cytotoxic effects of La (III) complex with bis(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-piridin-2-yl-methane were evaluated on the SKW-3 cells. In order to elucidate some of the mechanistic aspects of the observed cytotoxic effects we evaluated the ability of this complex to trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis by means of agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA), isolated from the cytosolic fraction of treated SKW-3 cells. In addition, microscopic morphological evaluation of the treated cells was carried out in order to establish morphological features indicative for programmed cell death.","['Kostova, Irena', 'Momekov, Georgi', 'Zaharieva, Maya', 'Karaivanova, Margarita']","['Kostova I', 'Momekov G', 'Zaharieva M', 'Karaivanova M']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University, 2 Dunav Street, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria. irenakostova@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '33A856C3T7 (lanthanide nitrate)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coumarins/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Formazans/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lanthanum/*chemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Tetrazolium Salts/chemistry']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2004/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0223-5234(05)00024-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2004.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2005 Jun;40(6):542-51. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2004.12.007.

In each case, PML from the endogenous genes was reorganized to participate with the exogenously expressed PML in the new configuration of ND10. Variation in ND10 number is known to occur during the cell cycle; however, the cell cycle distribution of the transfected cells that displayed these altered ND10 was similar for all six PML isoforms.

Anthocyanins exist widely in many vegetables and fruits. Some reports demonstrated that anthocyanins extracted from H. sabdariffa L., Hibiscus anthocyanins (HAs) (which are a group of natural pigments existing in the dried calyx of H. sabdariffa L.) exhibited antioxidant activity and liver protection. Therefore, in this study, we explored the effect of HAs on human cancer cells. The result showed that HAs could cause cancer cell apoptosis, especially in HL-60 cells. Using flow cytometry, we found that HAs treatment (0-4 mg/ml) markedly induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The result also revealed increased phosphorylation in p38 and c-Jun, cytochrome c release, and expression of tBid, Fas, and FasL in the HAs-treated HL-60 cells. We further used SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI-3K inhibitor) to evaluate their effect on the HAs-induced HL-60 death. The data showed that only SB203580 had strong potential in inhibiting HL-60 cell apoptosis and related protein expression and phosphorylation. Therefore, we suggested that HAs mediated HL-60 apoptosis via the p38-FasL and Bid pathway. According to these results, HAs could be developed as chemopreventive agents.

These are translated to responses of replicative arrest, damage repair, and apoptosis aimed at cellular recovery from the damage. p53 tumor suppressor is a central stress response protein, activated by multiple endogenous and environmental insults, including UV radiation. The significance of p53 in the DNA damage responses has frequently been reviewed in the context of ionizing radiation or other double strand break (DSB)-inducing agents. Despite partly similar patterns, the molecular events following UV radiation are, however, distinct from the responses induced by DSBs and are profoundly coupled with transcriptional stress. These are illustrated, e.g., by the UV damage-specific translocations of Mdm2, promyelocytic leukemia protein, and nucleophosmin and their interactions with p53.

Previously, murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vectors expressing GFP from an internal EF-1alpha promoter and lentiviral vectors expressing GFP from a hybrid CMV/beta-actin promoter have been described to be resistant to stem cell specific gene silencing. Therefore, we investigated whether these viral vectors allow stable in vivo gene expression in genetically modified NPC isolated from the adult rat spinal cord. In vitro, NPC genetically modified to express GFP using the described retroviral vector showed strong GFP expression in undifferentiated NPC. However, in vitro differentiation resulted in the loss of GFP expression in 50% of cells. Grafting of BrdU-prelabeled NPC to the spinal cord resulted in a loss of GFP expression in 70% and 95% of surviving NPC at 7 and 28 days post-grafting, respectively. The loss in gene expression was paralleled by the differentiation of NPC into a glial phenotype. Transgene downregulation although less profound was also observed in cells modified with lentiviral vectors, whereas in vivo lentiviral gene transfer resulted in stable transgene expression for up to 16 months. Thus, in vivo gene expression in genetically engineered neural progenitor cells is temporally limited and mostly restricted to undifferentiated NPC using the viral vectors tested.","['Vroemen, Maurice', 'Weidner, Norbert', 'Blesch, Armin']","['Vroemen M', 'Weidner N', 'Blesch A']","['Department of Neurology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Lentivirus/physiology', 'Neurons/*cytology/physiology', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'Spinal Cord/*physiology/virology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Stem Cells/*physiology/virology', 'Time Factors']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4886(05)00153-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.expneurol.2005.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2005 Sep;195(1):127-39. doi: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2005.04.012.,,['5R21NS046466/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mononuclear cells isolated from the bone marrow of an acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M(5b)) patient at relapse were inoculated in a liquid culture system. And the biologic features of the established cell line SHI-1 were characterized by morphology, cytochemical staining, flow cytometry, karyotypic analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), tumorigenicity in nude mice, quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction, broth medium culture, short tandem repeating sequences-PCR (STR-PCR), multiplex-FISH (M-FISH), and (3)H-thymidine incorporation assay. RESULTS: A human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, SHI-1, was established and has proliferated continuously in vitro for over one year. The cell line presented typical morphology and immuno-profile of monocytic lineage with the original t(6;11)(q27;q23) and del(17)(p11) abnormalities. The MLL-AF6 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR. The rearrangement of MLL gene, deletion of p53 gene, and translocation between chromosomes 6 and 11 were revealed by FISH. A point mutation of ATC-->ACC at exon 6 of the p53 gene was found by sequencing of the PCR products. The clonality and the high tumorigenicity of the SHI-1 cell line were confirmed. Infections of EBV and mycoplasma were excluded. A derivative chromosome 7 resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 7 and 13, monosomy 18 and a minute derived from chromosome 8 in addition to t(6;11) and deletion(17)(p11) were detected by M-FISH in SHI-1 cells passaged to March 2003. Cell line authentication by STR-PCR confirmed the identity to the original leukemic cells of the patient. (3)H-thymidine incorporation assay showed that IL-4 and IL-15 had proliferative effects, while IFN-gamma, TNFalpha, IL-2, PDGF, and IL-7 had inhibitory effects on the cell line.

The indirect immunofluorescence staining technique was applied to the localization of RbAp46 protein in BMMNC both in leukemia patients and control subjects. RESULTS: (1) Both RbAp46 protein and mRNA were expressed in AL BMMNC and no significant difference was found among different leukemia types. (2) The expression of RbAp46 protein was lower in AL patients with high-degree tumor burden than in those with low-degree tumor burden (mean A, 93.4 +/- 37.2 vs 127.2 +/- 15.8, P < 0. 05).

CBMNCs and high-titer retrovirus supernatant were cocultured with cytokine combinations for 5 - 6 days. The SCID mouse models bearing human HL-60 cell leukemia were divided into three groups. Group A received tail vein injection of 2 x 10(6) mdr1 gene transduced CBMNCs at day 1 and 3, groups B and C 2 x 10(6) un-transduced CBMNCs and same volume of normal saline, respectively. The 3 groups of the mouse model were treated with weekly escalated doses of homoharringtonine.

Two common polymorphisms (677C>T and 1298A>C) in the gene coding for MTHFR have been shown to reduce MTHFR enzyme activity and were associated with the susceptibility to different disorders, including vascular disease, neural tube defects and lymphoid malignancies. Studies on the role of these polymorphisms in the susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) led to discrepant results. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the association of the MTHFR 677C>T and 1298A>C polymorphisms with pediatric ALL by genotyping a study sample of 443 ALL patients consecutively enrolled onto the German multicenter trial ALL-BFM 2000 and 379 healthy controls. We calculated odds ratios of MTHFR genotypes based on the MTHFR 677C>T and 1298A>C polymorphisms to examine if one or both of these polymorphisms are associated with pediatric ALL. RESULTS: No significant associations between specific MTHFR variants or combinations of variants and risk of ALL were observed neither in the total patient group nor in analyses stratified by gender, age at diagnosis, DNA index, immunophenotype, or TEL/AML1 rearrangement. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the MTHFR 677C>T and 1298A>C gene variants do not have a major influence on the susceptibility to pediatric ALL in the German population.","['Schnakenberg, Eckart', 'Mehles, Andrea', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Rehe, Klaus', 'Seidemann, Kathrin', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Elsner, Holger A', 'Welte, Karl H', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin']","['Schnakenberg E', 'Mehles A', 'Cario G', 'Rehe K', 'Seidemann K', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Elsner HA', 'Welte KH', 'Schrappe M', 'Stanulla M']","['Institute for Pharmacogenetic and Genetic Disposition, Langenhagen, Germany. es@ipgd.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/06/01 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2350-6-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2350-6-23 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2005 May 27;6:23. doi: 10.1186/1471-2350-6-23.,,,20050527,,,PMC1164414,,,,,,,,

However, it is still not clear which patients should receive mobilized PBPC or bone marrow cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis after myeloablative conditioning. The aim of this study is to present 3-year-follow-up data on outcome (incidence and severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) after a PBPC transplant (PBPCT) or a bone marrow transplant (BMT). DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on 350 patients with leukemia were collected in a multicenter, randomized study initiated by the EBMT. The patients were randomized to receive filgrastim-mobilized PBSCT or BMT from an HLA-identical donor. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 3 years, significantly more patients transplanted with PBPC than with bone marrow developed chronic GVHD (73% vs 55%, p=0.003) and extensive chronic GvHD (36% vs 19%, p=0.002). The higher incidence and greater severity of chronic GvHD had little impact on the patient's performance status or survival. OS was 58% for PBPCT recipients versus 65% among those undergoing BMT. LFS was 56% for PBPCT recipients versus 60% for BMT recipients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients transplanted with PBPC from an HLA-identical sibling develop more chronic GvHD than those transplanted with bone marrow, but the final impact of this difference is unclear. Longer follow-up is necessary to characterize the impact of chronic GvHD on quality of life, leukemia-free survival and overall survival.","['Schmitz, Norbert', 'Beksac, Meral', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Szerm, Jeff', 'Bradstock, Kenneth', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Matcham, James', 'Gratwohl, Alois']","['Schmitz N', 'Beksac M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Ruutu T', 'Nagler A', 'Gluckman E', 'Russell N', 'Apperley J', 'Szerm J', 'Bradstock K', 'Buzyn A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Matcham J', 'Gratwohl A']","['Department of Hematology, AK St Georg, Lohmuehlenstrasse 5, 20099 Hamburg, Germany. norbert.schmitz@ak-stgeorg.lbk-hh.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Life Tables', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Siblings', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/06/01 09:00,2007/11/13 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 May;90(5):643-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many cancer cells are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL. The present study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: TRAIL/TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) expression and sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were explored in 79 AML patients, including 17 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). RESULTS: In non-APL AML we observed frequent expression of TRAIL decoy receptors (TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4), while TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 expression was restricted to AML exhibiting monocytic features. Total leukemic blasts, as well as AML colony-forming units (AML-CFU), were invariably resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. APL express membrane-bound TRAIL on their surface and exhibit a pattern of TRAIL-R expression similar to that observed in the other types of AML. Before, during and after retinoic acid treatment APL cells are TRAIL-resistant. The induction of granulocytic maturation of APL cells by retinoic acid was associated with a marked decline of TRAIL expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of experimental APL models (i.e., U937 cells engineered to express PML/RAR-Eo and NB4 cells) provided evidence that PML/RAR-Eo expression was associated with downmodulation of TRAIL-R1 and with resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We suggest that AML blasts, including APL blasts, are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, a phenomenon seemingly related to the expression of TRAIL decoy receptors on these cells. Finally, APL blasts express membrane-bound TRAIL that could confer an immunologic privilege to these cells.","['Riccioni, Roberta', 'Pasquini, Luca', 'Mariani, Gualtiero', 'Saulle, Ernestina', 'Rossini, Annalisa', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Chierichini, Anna', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Foa, Robin', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Peschle, Cesare', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Riccioni R', 'Pasquini L', 'Mariani G', 'Saulle E', 'Rossini A', 'Diverio D', 'Pelosi E', 'Vitale A', 'Chierichini A', 'Cedrone M', 'Foa R', 'Lo Coco F', 'Peschle C', 'Testa U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10D protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Caspase 8/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors/*physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'U937 Cells/drug effects']",2005/06/01 09:00,2007/11/13 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 May;90(5):612-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The contribution of sporadic rearrangements to malignancy is less clear and few have been mapped in detail. In this study we investigated the significance of novel translocations and inversions of 6q in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: Breakpoints of balanced 6q rearrangements were mapped in sequential fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with BAC and PAC clones in 11 patients. RESULTS: Six of seven breakpoints in ALL and two in a single case of AML were localized to within a 10.5 Mb hotspot at 6q22-q23 with five analyzed to the level of a single probe. In two cases of childhood T-ALL, both carrying a t(6;7)(q23;q32 through 36), split FISH signals were produced by adjacent PAC, mapping the breakpoints to within an approximately 150 Kb region containing the genes c-MYB and AHI1. Five similar rearrangements, four also in pediatric T ALL were identified in the literature. Other 6q22-q23 translocations mapped in detail interrupted regions containing no recognized genes. 6q breakpoints outside the q22-q23 region were widely dispersed and in two were mapped to positions overlapping the cloned fragile sites FRA6E and FRA6F. The involvement of MLL was demonstrated in one case with t(6;11)(q15;q23).

Increased bone marrow blasts (>5%) or cytogenetic/genetic markers indicate chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). A cryptic deletion of 4q12, i.e. del(4)(q12), producing the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene, identifies a distinct CEL subgroup (4q-/CEL). Our aims were: a) to use interphase-fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect the cryptic 4q12 deletion; b) to compare the clinico-hematologic features of 4q-/CEL with other HES; c) to investigate whether PDGFRB, FGFR1, ABL1, and ETV6-activated tyrosine kinases are rearranged in CEL/HES. DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter study included 20 patients fulfilling the WHO criteria for HES and 6 patients without signs/symptoms of end-organ involvement. Double-color FISH was applied in all cases to investigate del(4)(q12). Further interphase-FISH assessed whether PDGFRB/5q33, FGFR1/8p11, ABL1/9q34, and ETV6/12p13, undergo rearrangements in HES. RESULTS: Ten of the 26 patients (9 males and 1 female) had a cryptic del(4)(q12)-FIP1L1/PDGFRA which was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in four. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were significantly more frequent in these 10 than in the other 16 patients. Seven of these 10 patients received imatinib mesylate therapy and all achieved hematologic remission. In 3 of the patients interphase-FISH and RT-PCR demonstrated cytogenetic and molecular remission. Improvements were observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac and central nervous system involvement in 2 and 1 patient, respectively. Rearrangements of PDGFRB, FGFR1, ABL1, or ETV6 were not detected in this study. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: FISH is a reliable diagnostic test for differentiating 4q-/CEL from other forms of HES, allowing an early diagnosis of good responders to imatinib mesylate therapy. For the first time we show that PDGFRB, FGFR1, ABL1 and ETV6 are not rearranged in HES and 4q-/CEL cases we studied.","['La Starza, Roberta', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Beacci, Donatella', 'Nozzoli, Chiara', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Sambani, Constantina', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Foppoli, Marco', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['La Starza R', 'Specchia G', 'Cuneo A', 'Beacci D', 'Nozzoli C', 'Luciano L', 'Aventin A', 'Sambani C', 'Testoni N', 'Foppoli M', 'Invernizzi R', 'Marynen P', 'Martelli MF', 'Mecucci C']","['University of Perugia, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/ultrastructure', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/enzymology/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/analysis/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/analysis/*genetics']",2005/06/01 09:00,2007/11/13 09:00,['2005/06/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 May;90(5):596-601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneously the drug may be active against C-kit PDGFRalpha and beta, COL 1a1 and FIPI-LI gene mutations as well. Consequently, imatinib exerts a therapeutic effect upon chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stroma tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and hypereosinophilic syndroma.

On the other hand there is strong evidence with long follow-up that CML can be cured by stem cell transplantation, although there is a high risk of transplant-related complications.

In the present study, we illustrate the pathways utilized by clavulone II to trigger apoptotic signaling in human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Exposure of cells to clavulone II resulted in early induction of phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alteration of the cell cycle. Down-regulated expression of cyclin D1 explained the effect of clavulone II on G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. Clavulone II induced the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effect of 3 microM clavulone II was accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Mcl-1, and cleavage of Bid. Taken together, it is suggested that low concentrations of clavulone II induce the antiproliferative effect through the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and G1 arrest of the cell cycle, while that of high concentration induce the apoptotic cell death via the modulation of members of caspases and Bcl-2 family proteins in HL-60 cells.","['Huang, Yu-Chun', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa', 'Shen, Ya-Ching', 'Teng, Che-Ming']","['Huang YC', 'Guh JH', 'Shen YC', 'Teng CM']","['Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '85700-43-2 (clavulone II)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthozoa', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Prostaglandins/*chemistry', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11373-005-3009-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2005;12(2):335-45. doi: 10.1007/s11373-005-3009-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined whether GO was effective on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)- or arsenic trioxide (ATO)-resistant APL cells. Cells used were an APL cell line in which P-gp was undetectable (NB4), ATRA-resistant NB4 (NB4/RA), NB4 and NB4/RA that had been transfected with MDR-1 cDNA (NB4/MDR and NB4/RA/MDR, respectively), ATO-resistant NB4 (NB4/As) and blast cells from eight patients with clinically ATRA-resistant APL including two patients with ATRA- and ATO-resistant APL. The efficacy of GO was analyzed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, the dye exclusion test and cell cycle distribution. GO suppressed the growth of NB4, NB4/RA and NB4/As cells in a dose-dependent manner. GO increased the percentage of hypodiploid cells significantly in NB4, NB4/RA and NB4/As cells, and by a limited degree in NB4/MDR and NB4/RA/MDR cells.

Pts were analyzed at diagnosis (n=116) and during follow-up (n=105, median 4 times, range 2--17). Median follow-up time was 258 days (range 16--1578 days). In 66 pts, the WT1 expression was analyzed in comparison to a second PCR marker or to multiparameter flow cytometry. Quantitative WT1 levels correlated to the clinical course or a second marker in 83-96% of the cases. Prognostic significance of WT1 levels was analyzed at diagnosis and three intervals: (1) days 16--60, (2) days 61--120, and (3) days 121--180 after start of chemotherapy. Higher levels of WT1 expression were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) within intervals 2 and 3 but not at diagnosis or interval 1. In addition, within these intervals, WT1/ABL levels <or=0.4% were associated with improved OS and EFS. An increase of WT1 levels was detected in 16/44 cases, which subsequently relapsed within a median of 38 days (range 8--180 days). In conclusion, quantification of WT1 may be used for MRD studies and for prognostification in AML.","['Weisser, M', 'Kern, W', 'Rauhut, S', 'Schoch, C', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Haferlach, T', 'Schnittger, S']","['Weisser M', 'Kern W', 'Rauhut S', 'Schoch C', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Medical Department III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. martin.weisser@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403809 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403809 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1416-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403809.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1416-1423.']",,,,,

We compared 67 DS patients from study AML-BFM 98 with 51 DS patients of the previous study AML-BFM 93, and the non-DS groups of both studies. Compared to non-DS patients, DS patients were treated with reduced anthracycline doses, without high-dose cytarabine/mitoxantrone and without cranial irradiation. AML-DS patients were in median 1.8 years old, and 102/118 (86%) showed the typical morphology of acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia. In study 93, seven DS patients did not receive AML-specific chemotherapy, and treatment modifications were more common. Results improved significantly for patients treated in study 98 with a 3-year survival of 91+/-4 vs 70+/-7% in study 93 (P=0.001). There were no differences in outcome concerning the age groups 0-<or=2 and 2-<or=4 years (event-free survival for treated patients 0-<or=2 years 83+/-4%, 2-<or=4 years 81+/-7%). The cumulative incidence of relapses was significantly lower in DS (7+/-3%) than in non-DS patients (28+/-7%). Therapy-related toxicity was generally lower in DS patients treated according to study 98.

It acts as an activator and repressor of different target genes, for example, in erythroid cells it represses cell proliferation and early hematopoietic genes while activating erythroid genes, yet it is not clear how both of these functions are mediated. Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. We also show that subsets of GATA-1 gene targets are bound in vivo by distinct complexes, thus linking specific GATA-1 partners to distinct aspects of its functions. Based on these findings, we suggest a model for the different roles of GATA-1 in erythroid differentiation.","['Rodriguez, Patrick', 'Bonte, Edgar', 'Krijgsveld, Jeroen', 'Kolodziej, Katarzyna E', 'Guyot, Boris', 'Heck, Albert J R', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'de Boer, Ernie', 'Grosveld, Frank', 'Strouboulis, John']","['Rodriguez P', 'Bonte E', 'Krijgsveld J', 'Kolodziej KE', 'Guyot B', 'Heck AJ', 'Vyas P', 'de Boer E', 'Grosveld F', 'Strouboulis J']","['Department of Cell Biology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MeCP1 histone deacetylase complex, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZFPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Zfpm1 protein, mouse)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (MTA2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/09/08 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2004/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600702 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600702 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2005 Jul 6;24(13):2354-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600702.

Most patients had profound defects in CD4 and CD8 T-cell numbers at diagnosis that did not recover during the 2 years of therapy. Thymic output and the fraction of naive T cells were significantly lower than in healthy controls. However, the remaining T-cell compartment was enriched for antigen-experienced, memory T cells defined both by phenotype and by function. This relative sparing of T-cell memory may, in part, account for the maintenance of protective immunity in lymphopenic patients treated for ALL. Moreover, because the memory T-cell compartment is least affected by ALL and its treatment, strategies to induce immunity to pathogens or tumor antigens in cancer patients may be most successful if they seek to expand pre-existing memory T cells.","['Haining, W Nicholas', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Keczkemethy, Heather L', 'Evans, John W', 'Rivoli, Stephen', 'Gelman, Rebecca', 'Rosenblatt, Howard M', 'Shearer, William T', 'Guenaga, Javier', 'Douek, Daniel C', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Guinan, Eva C', 'Nadler, Lee M']","['Haining WN', 'Neuberg DS', 'Keczkemethy HL', 'Evans JW', 'Rivoli S', 'Gelman R', 'Rosenblatt HM', 'Shearer WT', 'Guenaga J', 'Douek DC', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE', 'Guinan EC', 'Nadler LM']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA. nicholas_haining@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Thymopoietins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thymopoietins/immunology', 'Time Factors']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53083-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-1082 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 1;106(5):1749-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1082.

Here we have investigated samples from 679 patients and controls for the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 V617F mutation. Of the 480 myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) samples, the proportion of positive cases per disease subtype was 30 (20%) of 152 for atypical or unclassified MPD, 2 of 134 (2%) for idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, 58 of 72 (81%) for polycythemia vera, 24 of 59 (41%) essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 15 of 35 (43%) for idiopathic myelofibrosis. V617F was not identified in patients with systemic mastocytosis (n = 28), chronic or acute myeloid leukemia (n = 35), secondary erythrocytosis (n = 4), or healthy controls (n = 160). Homozygosity for V617F was seen in 43% of mutant samples and was closely correlated with chromosome 9p uniparental disomy. Homozygosity was significantly less common in ET compared with other MPD subtypes. In 53 cases analyzed, the median level of PRV1 expression was significantly higher in V617F-positive cases compared with cases without the mutation. We conclude that V617F is widespread in MPDs. Detection of this acquired mutation is likely to have a major impact on the way patients with MPD are diagnosed, as well as serving as an obvious target for signal transduction therapy.","['Jones, Amy V', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Zoi, Katerina', 'Waghorn, Katherine', 'Curtis, Claire', 'Zhang, Lingyan', 'Score, Joannah', 'Seear, Rachel', 'Chase, Andrew J', 'Grand, Francis H', 'White, Helen', 'Zoi, Christine', 'Loukopoulos, Dimitris', 'Terpos, Evangelos', 'Vervessou, Elisavet-Christine', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Emig, Michael', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Oscier, David', 'Silver, Richard T', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Cross, Nicholas C P']","['Jones AV', 'Kreil S', 'Zoi K', 'Waghorn K', 'Curtis C', 'Zhang L', 'Score J', 'Seear R', 'Chase AJ', 'Grand FH', 'White H', 'Zoi C', 'Loukopoulos D', 'Terpos E', 'Vervessou EC', 'Schultheis B', 'Emig M', 'Ernst T', 'Lengfelder E', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Oscier D', 'Silver RT', 'Reiter A', 'Cross NC']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury SP2 8BJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Epidemiology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/10/12 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63443-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-1320 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 15;106(6):2162-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1320.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is blocked by the alpha isoform of macaque TRIM5 (TRIM5alpha(rh)) or by the product of the owl monkey TRIM5-cyclophilin A gene fusion (TRIMCyp). Human TRIM5alpha potently restricts specific strains of murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) but has only a modest effect on HIV-1. The amino termini of TRIM5 orthologues are highly conserved and possess a coiled-coil domain that promotes homomultimerization. Here we show that heterologous expression of TRIM5alpha(rh) or TRIMCyp in human cells interferes with the anti-N-MLV activity of endogenous human TRIM5alpha (TRIM5alpha(hu)). Deletion of the cyclophilin domain from TRIMCyp has no effect on heteromultimerization or colocalization with TRIM5alpha(hu) but prevents interference with anti-N-MLV activity. These data demonstrate that TRIM5 orthologues form heteromultimers and indicate that C-terminal extensions alter virus recognition by multimers of these proteins.,"['Berthoux, Lionel', 'Sebastian, Sarah', 'Sayah, David M', 'Luban, Jeremy']","['Berthoux L', 'Sebastian S', 'Sayah DM', 'Luban J']","['Department of Microbiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 701 West 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Aotidae/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclophilin A/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Haplorhini/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Macaca mulatta/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/12/7883 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.12.7883-7888.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jun;79(12):7883-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.12.7883-7888.2005.,,"['R01 AI036199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI36199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1143641,,,,,,,,

Although these two MAbs, 35/56 and 83A25, have very different patterns of reactivity with viral isolates, determinants of both epitopes were mapped to the last C-terminal disulfide-bonded loop of SU (loop 10), and residues in this loop responsible for the different specificities of these MAbs were identified. Both MAbs reacted with a minor fraction of a truncated SU fragment terminating four residues after loop 10, indicating that while the deleted C-terminal residues were not part of these epitopes, they promoted their formation. Neither MAb recognized the loop 10 region expressed in isolated form, suggesting that these epitopes were not completely localized within loop 10 but required additional sequences located N terminal to the loop. Direct support for a role for loop 10 in fusion was provided by the demonstration that Env mutants containing an extra serine or threonine residue between the second and third positions of the loop were highly attenuated for infectivity and defective in fusion assays, despite wild-type levels of expression, processing, and receptor binding. Other mutations at positions 1 to 3 of loop 10 inhibited processing of the gPr80 precursor protein or led to increased shedding of SU, suggesting that loop 10 also affects Env folding and the stability of the interaction between SU and TM.","['Burkhart, Michael D', ""D'Agostino, Paul"", 'Kayman, Samuel C', 'Pinter, Abraham']","['Burkhart MD', ""D'Agostino P"", 'Kayman SC', 'Pinter A']","['Public Health Research Institute, 225 Warren Street, Newark, NJ 07103-3506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Disulfides/*metabolism', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Folding', 'Rats', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/12/7868 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.12.7868-7876.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jun;79(12):7868-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.12.7868-7876.2005.,,"['R01 AI050452/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI046283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI46283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI046283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI50452/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI046283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1143666,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of development of ATL and HAM among the large number of HTLV-I-positive renal transplant recipients in western Japan. In principle immunosuppressive drugs have the possibilities to accelerate ATL development but are thought to suppress HAM development. Of 120 renal transplant recipients, 10 HTLV-I-positive recipients were reviewed, none of whom developed ATL or HAM. There are 11,896 dialysis patients in Japan and 300 dialysis patients in Okinawa who are registered with the JOTN for cadaveric renal transplant. The numbers of HTLV-I-positive patients in these groups were 97 (0.82%) and 26 (8.67%), respectively. These numbers are thought to be sufficient for an HTLV-I-positive recipient pool for HTLV-I-positive donors. Ten cases of ATL development and two of HAM development have been previously reported. Because of low number of ATL development, renal transplantation does not appear to be a contraindication for HTLV-I-positive chronic renal failure patients.

Eco is a store-operated Ca2+ channel antagonist which induces cytotoxic cell death of leukemia. However, little is known about its cytotoxic effect upon solid tumor cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate both the in vitro and in vivo molecular mechanisms of Eco-induced toxicity on colon cancer cells. We used COLO 205 cell line and nude mice xenograft model to investigate the cytotoxic effect of Eco. We demonstrated that lower doses Eco (5-20 microM) arrested human colon cancer cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The protein levels of p53, p21/Cip1, and p27/Kip1 were significantly elevated while CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activity were significantly suppressed by Eco treatment in COLO 205 cells. At higher doses (40-60 microM), Eco induced COLO 205 cells apoptosis evidenced by ladder formation in DNA fragmentation assay and sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry analysis. Western blot analysis showed that caspases 3, 9 but not 8 were activated by high dose Eco treatment to the COLO 205 cells accompanied with cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation. Significant anti-tumorigenesis effect was further demonstrated in vivo by treating nude mice bearing COLO 205 tumor xenografts with Eco 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally.

Shb is an adaptor protein previously implicated in the angiogenic response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To elucidate a possible role of Shb in embryonic vascular development, wild-type and SH2 domain mutated (R522K) Shb were overexpressed in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. Embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiating from Shb-overexpressing ES cells in vitro were stained for CD31 or VEGFR-2 to visualize the formation of vascular structures. We found that Shb promotes the outgrowth of blood vessels in EBs both in the absence and presence of growth factors. This response may be the consequence of an increased number of VEGFR-2 positive cells at an early stage of EB development, a finding corroborated by both immunostaining and real-time RT-PCR. In addition, Shb overexpression upregulated the expression of PDGFR-beta, CD31, CD41 and Tal1. Cells co-expressing VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-beta were commonly observed when Shb was overexpressed and inhibition of PDGF-BB signaling reduced the amount of VEGFR-2 mRNA under these conditions. EBs expressing the Shb R522K-mutant did not form vascular structures. Microarray analysis of VEGFR-2/CD31 positive cells after 6 days of differentiation revealed numerous changes of expression of genes relating to an endothelial/hematopoietic phenotype in response to Shb overexpression. The findings suggest that Shb may play a crucial role during early ES cell differentiation to vascular structures by transducing VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-beta signals.","['Rolny, Charlotte', 'Lu, Lingge', 'Agren, Nina', 'Nilsson, Ingrid', 'Roe, Cheryl', 'Webb, Gene C', 'Welsh, Michael']","['Rolny C', 'Lu L', 'Agren N', 'Nilsson I', 'Roe C', 'Webb GC', 'Welsh M']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Box 571, BMC, Husargatan 3, 751 23 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Shb protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blood Vessels/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/genetics/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(05)00179-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2005 Aug 15;308(2):381-93. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.04.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated possible involvement of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases; extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, in the chymase-induced eosinophil migration. Human chymase induced a rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cells, while no phosphorylation was detected in JNK. The chymase-induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was inhibited by pertussis toxin. Similar results were obtained in the experiments using mouse chymase and eosinophils. U0126 (the inhibitor for MAP/ERK kinase) suppressed chymase-induced migration of EoL-1 cells and mouse eosinophils. However, SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) showed little effect on the migration. It is suggested therefore that chymase activates ERK and p38 probably through G-protein-coupled receptor, and that ERK but not p38 cascade may have a crucial role in chymase-induced migration of eosinophils.","['Terakawa, Maki', 'Tomimori, Yoshiaki', 'Goto, Megumi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhiro', 'Oikawa, Shinzo', 'Fukuda, Yoshiaki']","['Terakawa M', 'Tomimori Y', 'Goto M', 'Hayashi Y', 'Oikawa S', 'Fukuda Y']","['Daiichi Suntory Biomedical Research Limited, 1-1-1 Wakayamadai, Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka 618-8513, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (U 0126)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis', 'Chymases', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*chemistry/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2005/05/28 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/05/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)00823-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.04.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Jul 15;332(4):969-75. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.04.172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: This study focused on attentional functioning and speed of information processing in 23 children previously treated for ALL according to EORTC 58881 and EORTC 58951 protocol. Patients received intrathecal methotrexate combined with high doses intravenous methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis. Cognitive functioning was assessed with the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks, a computerized attention assessment program. Variables of both speed and accuracy of the patients were compared with those obtained from 23 age- and sex-matched control children. RESULTS: Patients were equal to control children concerning baseline speed, sustained attention, response inhibition, and response organization. However, they were significantly slower than controls in three tasks: encoding, memory search letters, and focused attention 4-letters. Interactions with the difficulty of the task were found. There were no differences in number or type of errors between groups on all tasks. CONCLUSIONS: ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy have specific information processing difficulties. They process information slower than control children, especially when more information has to be processed or when attention has to be focused precisely.

Selected combinations of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) arranged in multicolor panels allow for the accurate definition of normal and abnormal hematologic cell populations. The most time-consuming and crucial step in the staining process involves dispensing combinations of multiple mAbs into their appropriate staining tubes. This step is prone to error, requires concentration and accuracy, and is dependent on technologist experience. The Becton Dickinson BioScience (BD) FACS Sample Prep Assistant (SPA) is touted as a breakthrough in automated in vitro diagnostic sample preparation. The SPA is designed to automate BD MultiTESk and BD TriTest lyse/no-wash assays. However, because most cases in our laboratory require tedious application of unique four-color mAb cocktails for leukemia and lymphoma testing, we wondered whether the SPA would be helpful in accurately dispensing these mixtures. METHODS: The mAb panels were prepared by the SPA in two separate timed runs and on separate days. Eleven specimens (nine from patients and two from normal volunteers) were split and stained with four-color cocktails created by the SPA or manually. The percentage of positive (%P) cells and mean fluorescent intensity for each mAb pair were determined. These values were plotted against each other and correlation values were calculated. To quantitate timesaving in the laboratory, two technologists prepared individually the same mAb panels and were timed. RESULTS: The correlation between the two methods was high; r(2) was 0.988 for 158 %P antigen pairs; no bias between the manual and robotic methods was detected with the Wilcoxon rank test. Bland-Altman analysis indicated no obvious relation between the difference and the mean of %P cells, suggesting that the SPA successfully dispensed antibodies for leukemia/lymphoma panels. The two methods may be interchangeable, although the limited sample size prohibits this conclusion from Bland-Altman statistics alone. In addition, one possible error was detected in the SPA-prepared panels. The SPA averaged 65 min/run, the experienced technologist 12.95 min/run, and the inexperienced technologist 54.9 min/run. CONCLUSIONS: SPA dispensing time was twice the average manual dispensing time; however, SPA use was completely automated and freed the technologist to perform other tasks. SPA use permitted preemptive preparation of mAb panels and thus streamlined processing; however, the cost of the assay and the amount of reagent waste increased. It is certain that software modifications by BD could decrease the SPA reagent dispense time and decrease the cost associated with reagent waste when the SPA is used in this novel fashion.","['Kelliher, Abigail S', 'Parent, David W', 'Anderson, David C', 'Dorn, Michelle E', 'Hahn, Jessica L', 'Eapen, Sara', 'Preffer, Frederic I']","['Kelliher AS', 'Parent DW', 'Anderson DC', 'Dorn ME', 'Hahn JL', 'Eapen S', 'Preffer FI']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. asallen@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Monoclonal or oligoclonal expansion of T-cells was detected in 5 of 7 HTLV-I-positive patients with abnormal lymphocytes and unconfirmed diagnosis by using PCR amplification of segments of TCR-beta gene, in a set of reactions that target 102 different variable (V) segments, covering all members of the 24 V families available in the gene bank, including the more recently identified segments of the Vbeta-5 and Vbeta-8 family and the two diversity beta segments. Southern blots, the gold standard method to detect T-lymphocyte clonality, were negative for all of these 7 patients, what highlights the low sensitivity of this method that requires a large amount of very high quality DNA. To evaluate the performance of PCR in the detection of clonality we also analyzed 18 leukemia patients, all of whom tested positive. Clonal expansion was not detected in any of the negative controls or healthy carriers without abnormal lymphocytes. In conclusion, PCR amplification of segments of rearranged TCR-beta is reliable and highly suitable for the detection of small populations of clonal T-cells in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers who present abnormal peripheral blood lymphocytes providing an additional instrument for following up these patients with potentially higher risk of leukemia.","['Sales, M M', 'Bezerra, C N A', 'Hiraki, Y', 'Melo, N B', 'Reboucas, N A']","['Sales MM', 'Bezerra CN', 'Hiraki Y', 'Melo NB', 'Reboucas NA']","['Servico de Hematologia, Divisao de Laboratorio Central, Departamento de Patologia, Hospital das Clinicas, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/05/27 09:00,2005/12/28 09:00,['2005/05/27 09:00'],"['2005/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2005000500006 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2005000500006 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2005 May;38(5):695-704. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2005000500006.

Synthesized as inactive precursors, caspases become activated sequentially in cascades. Activation of apical or initiator caspases in these cascades occurs in macromolecular complexes located in various compartments. One such complex is the plasma membrane-bound death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), formed upon engagement of death receptors, which recruits and activates caspase-8 and -10. Another complex is the cytosolic apoptosome, assembled in response to the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which recruits caspase-9. The other major human initiator caspase is caspase-2, which is activated in response to various lethal stimuli and has recently been shown to be required for DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The regulation of caspase-2 is not well understood. Here we present evidence that caspase-2 is localized to the promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), nuclear macro-molecular complexes that are involved in many scenarios of apoptosis including DNA damage. The localization of caspase-2 requires both the prodomain and protease domain but appears to be independent of its adaptor protein, CRADD/RAIDD. These data suggest the existence of a nuclear apoptosis pathway that involves both caspase-2 and the PML-NBs.","['Tang, Jun', 'Xie, Wensheng', 'Yang, Xiaolu']","['Tang J', 'Xie W', 'Yang X']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein)', '0 (CRADD protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein', 'Caspase 2', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2005/05/27 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/05/27 09:00'],"['2005/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1729 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.4.6.1729 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2005 Jun;4(6):645-9. doi: 10.4161/cbt.4.6.1729.

We have recently demonstrated that imatinib also specifically targets the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor, c-fms, at therapeutic concentrations. Although this finding has important implications with regard to potential side effects in patients currently receiving imatinib therapy, these results suggest that imatinib may also be useful in the treatment of diseases where c-fms is implicated.

Mice that lacked SCL expression showed a complete block in hematopoiesis; thus, SCL was associated with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. More recent studies show a role for SCL in murine erythroid differentiation. However, the expression pattern and the role of SCL during early stages of human hematopoietic differentiation are less clear. In this study we chart the pattern of human SCL expression from HSCs, through developmentally sequential populations of lymphoid and myeloid progenitors to mature cells of the hematopoietic lineages. Using recently defined surface immunophenotypes, we fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FACS) highly purified populations of primary human hematopoietic progenitors for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of SCL expression. Our data show that SCL mRNA is easily detectable in all hematopoietic populations with erythroid potential, including HSCs, multipotential progenitors, common myeloid progenitors, megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors, and nucleated erythroid lineage cells. SCL mRNA expression was present but rapidly downregulated in the common lymphoid progenitor and granulocyte/monocyte progenitor populations that lack erythroid potential. SCL expression was undetectable in immature cells of nonerythroid lineages, including pro-B cells, early thymic progenitors, and myeloid precursors expressing the M-CSF receptor. SCL expression was also absent from all mature cells of the nonerythroid lineages. Although low levels of SCL were detected in lymphoid- and myeloid-restricted progenitors, our studies show that abundant SCL expression is normally tightly linked with erythroid differentiation potential.","['Zhang, Yanjia', 'Payne, Kimberly J', 'Zhu, Yuhua', 'Price, Mary A', 'Parrish, Yasmin K', 'Zielinska, Ewa', 'Barsky, Lora W', 'Crooks, Gay M']","['Zhang Y', 'Payne KJ', 'Zhu Y', 'Price MA', 'Parrish YK', 'Zielinska E', 'Barsky LW', 'Crooks GM']","['Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, M.S.#62, 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/*physiology']",2005/05/27 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/05/27 09:00'],"['2005/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/6/852 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2004-0260 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2005 Jun-Jul;23(6):852-60. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2004-0260.,,"['K01 DK066163/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50HL54850/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL77912/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because mice are known to harbor a variety of pathogens, such culture conditions implicate the risk of xenozoonoses. Among these pathogens, endogenous retroviruses, including murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), are of special importance. It is well known that some strains cause pathogenic (e.g., leukemic) effects and that xenotropic, polytropic, and amphotropic MuLVs are able to infect human cells. In view of potential clinical applications of hESC lines, it is therefore imperative to investigate potential infection of hESCs by mouse feeder cell-derived viruses. As a first step towards a comprehensive infection risk assessment, we have analyzed embryonic fibroblasts derived from different mouse strains for expression and release of xenotropic, polytropic, and amphotropic MuLVs. Moreover, several hESC lines have been investigated for expression of specific receptors for xenotropic/polytropic MuLVs, as well as for MuLV infection and expression. Evidence for expression of humantropic MuLVs was found in cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Moreover, expression of specific receptors for xenotropic/ polytropic MuLV on human HEK293 and hESC lines and infection after coculture with an MuLV-producing mink cell line could be demonstrated. In contrast, no evidence of MuLV transmission from MEFs to human HEK293 cells or to the hESC lines I-3, I-6, I-8, and H-9 has been obtained. Our results suggest that recently established hESC lines are free of MuLV infections despite long-term close contact with MEFs.","['Amit, Michal', 'Winkler, Monica E', 'Menke, Sandra', 'Bruning, Eva', 'Buscher, Kristina', 'Denner, Joachim', 'Haverich, Axel', 'Itskovitz-Eldor, Joseph', 'Martin, Ulrich']","['Amit M', 'Winkler ME', 'Menke S', 'Bruning E', 'Buscher K', 'Denner J', 'Haverich A', 'Itskovitz-Eldor J', 'Martin U']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, The Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infections', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Species Specificity', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/virology']",2005/05/27 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/05/27 09:00'],"['2005/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/6/761 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2004-0046 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2005 Jun-Jul;23(6):761-71. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2004-0046.,,['1R24RR018405-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated levels of ALDH have been demonstrated in murine and human progenitor cells compared with other hematopoietic cells, and this is thought to be important in chemoresistance. A method for the assessment of ALDH activity in viable cells recently has been developed and made commercially available in a kit format. In this study, we confirmed the use of the ALDH substrate kit to identify cord blood stem/progenitor cells. Via multicolor flow cytometry of cord blood ALDH+ cells, we have expanded on their phenotypic analysis. We then assessed the incidence, morphology, phenotype, and nonobese diabetic/ severe combined immunodeficiency engraftment ability of ALDH+ cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. AML samples had no ALDH+ cells at all, an extremely rare nonmalignant stem/progenitor cell population, or a less rare, leukemic stem cell population. Hence, in addition to identifying nonmalignant stem cells within some AML samples, a high ALDH activity also identifies some patients' CD34+/ CD38- leukemic stem cells. The incidence of normal or leukemic stem cells with an extremely high ALDH activity may have important implications for resistance to chemotherapy.

Using cells stably transfected with an antisense construct for caspase-2 (AS2) as well as a chemical caspase-2 inhibitor, we demonstrate that caspase-2 is required in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We also identified PKCdelta as a novel caspase-2 substrate. PKCdelta was cleaved/activated in a caspase-2-dependent manner after doxorubicin treatment both in cells and in vitro. PKCdelta is furthermore required for efficient doxorubicin-induced apoptosis because its chemical inhibition as well as adenoviral expression of a kinase dead (KD) mutant of PKCdelta severely attenuated doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PKCdelta and JNK inhibition show that PKCdelta lies upstream of JNK in doxorubicin-induced death. Jnk-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were highly resistant to doxorubicin compared with wild type (WT), as were WT Jurkat cells treated with SP600125, further supporting the importance of JNK in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

Based upon this pre-clinical data, a phase I/II study of 24h flavopiridol was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Patients with previously treated CLL patients were enrolled on two sequentially performed cohorts of 13 patients. Patients in the first cohort received flavopiridol (80 mg/m(2) as a 24-h continuous infusion [24h CI]) every 2 weeks. Patients in the second cohort received flavopiridol (80 mg/m(2) as a 24h CI) for week 1 and then were dose escalated by 20mg/m(2) every 2 weeks to a maximal dose of 140 mg/m(2) in the absence of symptoms. Patients received up to 12 doses of therapy. RESULTS: : Thirteen patients with fludarabine-refractory or intolerant CLL enrolled in each cohort. Patients received a median of five treatments in each cohort with only two patients completing all 12 courses of therapy. There were no partial or complete responses noted. Toxicity was manageable in most patients and included anemia, thrombocytopenia, infections, diarrhea, and fatigue.

Recently, it has been reported that deguelin, a naturally occurring rotenoid, is a powerful inhibitor of PI3K. We investigated whether or not deguelin could enhance the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs of human U937 leukaemia cells and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts with an activated PI3K/Akt network. Deguelin (10 nmol/l) induced S phase arrest with interference of progression to G2/M, and at 100 nmol/l significantly increased apoptotic cell death of U937. At 10-100 nmol/l concentrations, deguelin downregulated Akt phosphorylation of leukaemia cells and markedly increased sensitivity of U937 cells to etoposide or cytarabine. A 10 nmol/l concentration of deguelin did not negatively affect the survival rate of human cord blood CD34+ cells, whereas it increased sensitivity of AML blasts to cytarabine. Deguelin was less toxic than wortmannin on erythropoietin- and stem cell factor-induced erythropoiesis from CD34+ progenitor cells. Overall, our results indicate that deguelin might be used in the future for increasing sensitivity to therapeutic treatments of leukaemia cells with an active PI3K/Akt signalling network.","['Bortul, Roberta', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Mantovani, Irina', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Grafone, Tiziana', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Conte, Roberto', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Bortul R', 'Tazzari PL', 'Billi AM', 'Tabellini G', 'Mantovani I', 'Cappellini A', 'Grafone T', 'Martinelli G', 'Conte R', 'Martelli AM']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita di Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'K5Z93K66IE (deguelin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rotenone/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology']",2005/05/27 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/05/27 09:00'],"['2005/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5504 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05504.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Jun;129(5):677-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05504.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Levels of histone acetylation are tightly modulated in normal cells, and alterations of their regulating mechanisms have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis. METHODS: We developed a new flow cytometric technique for detection of histone acetylation, based on a specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes acetylated histone tails. Bivariate analysis for histone acetylation levels and DNA were performed to study modulation of chromatin organization during the cell cycle and after induction of histone hyperacetylation by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Histone acetylation and transcription levels were monitored during differentiation induced by retinoic acid alone or in combination with TSA. Blood samples from patients were analyzed with the described protocol to monitor the effects of HDAC inhibitors in vivo and validate the developed protocol for clinical usage. RESULTS: Flow cytometric detection of acetylation status can successfully detect modifications induced by HDAC inhibitor treatment in vivo as demonstrated by analysis of various blood samples from patients treated with valproic acid. Changes in acetylation levels during the cell cycle demonstrated a reproducible increase in histone acetylation during the replication phase that was subsequently decreased at the G2M entrance, thus paralleling the behavior of DNA replication and transcriptional activity. CONCLUSIONS: Multiparameter analysis of histone acetylation and expression of molecular markers, DNA ploidy, and/or cell cycle kinetics can provide a quick and statistically reliable tool for the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy in clinical trials using HDAC inhibitors.","['Ronzoni, Simona', 'Faretta, Mario', 'Ballarini, Marco', 'Pelicci, Piergiuseppe', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Ronzoni S', 'Faretta M', 'Ballarini M', 'Pelicci P', 'Minucci S']","['European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Previous studies identified several slr mutants that are co-lethal with rad2Delta and sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate as single mutants. One of these mutants, slr3-1, is characterized here. Complementation and sequence analyses show that slr3-1 (mcl1-101) is allelic to mcl1(+), which is required for chromosome replication, cohesion and segregation. mcl1-101 is temperature-sensitive for growth and is highly sensitive to DNA damage. mcl1 cells arrest with 2C DNA content and chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks accumulate at the restrictive temperature. Mcl1p, which belongs to the Ctf4p/SepBp family, interacts both genetically and physically with DNA polymerase alpha. Mutations in rhp51 and dna2 enhance the growth defect of the mcl1-101 mutant.

This study quantifies the effects of flow on cell migration during chemotaxis in a microfluidic device. The chemotaxis gradient within the device was modeled and compared to experimental results. Chemotaxis experiments were performed using the chemokine CXCL8 under different flow rates with human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells expressing a transfected CXCR2 chemokine receptor. Cell trajectories were separated into x and y axis components. When the microchannel flow rates were increased, cell trajectories along the x axis were found to be significantly affected (p < 0.05). Total migration distances were not affected. These results should be considered when using similar microfluidic devices for chemotaxis studies so that flow bias can be minimized. It may be possible to use this effect to estimate the total tractile force exerted by a cell during chemotaxis, which would be particularly valuable for cells whose tractile forces are below the level of detection with standard techniques of traction-force microscopy.","['Walker, Glenn M', 'Sai, Jiqing', 'Richmond, Ann', 'Stremler, Mark', 'Chung, Chang Y', 'Wikswo, John P']","['Walker GM', 'Sai J', 'Richmond A', 'Stremler M', 'Chung CY', 'Wikswo JP']","['Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Chemokines, CXC/physiology', 'Chemotaxis/*physiology', 'Diffusion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microfluidics/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Receptors, Chemokine/physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b417245k [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2005 Jun;5(6):611-8. doi: 10.1039/b417245k.

T-LGL proliferation seems to be triggered/sustained by antigenic drive; it is likely that hematopoietic progenitors are the targets in this process. The antigen-specific portion of the T-cell receptor (TCR), the variable beta (VB)-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), can serve as a molecular signature (clonotype) of a T-cell clone. We hypothesized that clonal CTL proliferation develops not randomly but in the context of an autoimmune response. We identified the clonotypic sequence of T-LGL clones in 60 patients, including 56 with known T-LGL and 4 with unspecified neutropenia. Our method also allowed for the measurement of clonal frequencies; a decrease in or loss of the pathogenic clonotype and restoration of the TCR repertoire was found after hematologic remission. We identified 2 patients with identical immunodominant CDR3 sequence. Moreover, we found similarity between multiple immunodominant clonotypes and codominant as well as a nonexpanded, ""supporting"" clonotypes. The data suggest a nonrandom clonal selection in T-LGL, possibly driven by a common antigen. In contrast, the physiologic clonal CTL repertoire is highly diverse and we were not able to detect any significant clonal sharing in 26 healthy controls.","['Wlodarski, Marcin W', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Howe, Evan C', 'Risitano, Antonio M', 'Rodriguez, Alexander', 'Warshawsky, Ilka', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Wlodarski MW', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Howe EC', 'Risitano AM', 'Rodriguez A', 'Warshawsky I', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Taussig Cancer Center/R40, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*pathology']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)69119-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-4045 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Oct 15;106(8):2769-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-4045.

Inhibition of antitumor immune responses has been mainly linked to inhibitory factors present in cancer patients. More recently, increased frequencies of CD4+CD25hi regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have been described as an additional mechanism reducing immunity. We assessed 73 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 42 healthy controls and demonstrated significantly increased frequencies of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4+)-, Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3+)-, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR+)-, CD62L+-, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1+)-, interleukin 10 (IL-10+)-Treg cells in patients with CLL, with highest frequencies in untreated or progressing patients presenting with extended disease. Most surprisingly, in the majority of patients with CLL treated with fludarabine-containing therapy regimens the inhibitory function of Treg cells was decreased or even abrogated. In addition, frequencies of Treg cells were significantly decreased after therapy with fludarabine. In light of similar findings for cyclophosphamide the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide might be further exploited in strategies reducing immunosuppression prior to cancer immunotherapy.","['Beyer, Marc', 'Kochanek, Matthias', 'Darabi, Kamruz', 'Popov, Alexey', 'Jensen, Markus', 'Endl, Elmar', 'Knolle, Percy A', 'Thomas, Roman K', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael', 'Debey, Svenja', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Schultze, Joachim L']","['Beyer M', 'Kochanek M', 'Darabi K', 'Popov A', 'Jensen M', 'Endl E', 'Knolle PA', 'Thomas RK', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon M', 'Debey S', 'Hallek M', 'Schultze JL']","['Molecular Tumor Biology and Tumor Immunology Clinic I for Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmann Str 9/Haus 16, 50931 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF18 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10', 'L-Selectin', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/10/12 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63424-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0642 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 15;106(6):2018-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0642.

However, CLL cells initially resist CD95-mediated apoptosis within the first 3 days after CD40 ligation in vitro. Thereafter, they become sensitive, which is associated with the CD40-induced expression of the proapoptotic protein B-cell leukemia 2 homology 3 (BH3) interacting domain death agonist (Bid). We hypothesized that the initial resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis may be due to the high-level expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) by CLL cells. Consistent with this, CLL cells from patients 1 day after treatment with autologous Ad-CD154-transduced CLL cells became sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis following treatment with a novel XIAP inhibitor, 1540-14. Similarly, 1540-14 specifically enhanced CD95-mediated apoptosis of CLL cells following CD40 ligation in vitro. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that treatment with 1540-14 allowed CD40-stimulated CLL cells to experience high-level activation of caspases-8 and -3 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase following CD95 ligation. This study demonstrates that distal apoptosis regulators contribute to the initial resistance of CD40-activated CLL cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis and suggests that XIAP inhibitors might enhance the effectiveness of immune-based treatment strategies that target CD40, such as CD154 gene therapy.","['Kater, Arnon P', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Mangiola, Massimo', 'Welsh, Kate', 'Houghten, Richard', 'Ostresh, John', 'Nefzi, Adel', 'Reed, John C', 'Pinilla, Clemencia', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Kater AP', 'Dicker F', 'Mangiola M', 'Welsh K', 'Houghten R', 'Ostresh J', 'Nefzi A', 'Reed JC', 'Pinilla C', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (1396-34 compound)', '0 (1540-14 compound)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Caspases/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53082-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0695 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 1;106(5):1742-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0695.

However, the molecular pathways underlying the transformation of normal cells into leukemic stem cells are still poorly understood. The involvement of a small group of key transcription factors into this process was suggested by their frequent mutation or down-regulation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent findings in mice with hypomorphic transcription-factor genes demonstrated that leukemic stem-cell formation in AML could directly be caused by reduced transcription-factor activity beyond a critical threshold. Most interestingly, those experimental models and the paucity of biallelic null mutations or deletions in transcription-factor genes in patients suggest that AML is generally associated with graded down-regulation rather than complete disruption of transcription factors. Here, we discuss the effects of transcription-factor concentrations on hematopoiesis and leukemia, with a focus on the regulation of transcription-factor gene expression as a major mechanism that alters critical threshold levels during blood development and cancer.","['Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Rosenbauer F', 'Koschmieder S', 'Steidl U', 'Tenen DG']","['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53053-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0717 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 1;106(5):1519-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0717.

Information on hair dye use was obtained through a personal interview together with information on other known or putative risk factors for lymphoma. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All ORs were adjusted for pathology center, sex, age, and house ownership. RESULTS: Ever use of hair dyes was associated with a non-significant 20% increased risk of lymphoma (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.7) with a slightly higher risk observed for those using permanent hair dyes (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.9). No association was observed with duration of use or lifetime doses of hair dyes. Among all lymphomas categories, only chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was significantly associated with the use of hair dyes (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7). The risk of CLL increased with lifetime doses received. CONCLUSIONS: Ever use of hair dye products is unlikely to substantially modify the risk of lymphoma. The observed association with CLL needs to be replicated.","['Benavente, Yolanda', 'Garcia, Natividad', 'Domingo-Domenech, Eva', 'Alvaro, Tomas', 'Font, Rebeca', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Benavente Y', 'Garcia N', 'Domingo-Domenech E', 'Alvaro T', 'Font R', 'Zhang Y', 'de Sanjose S']","[""Servei d'Epidemiologia and Registre del Cancer, IDIBELL, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,['0 (Hair Dyes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hair Dyes/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2005/05/26 09:00,2006/07/18 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyi109 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyi109 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2005 Oct;34(5):1118-22. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyi109.

Recently, the prophylactic use of lamivudine for HBV reactivation in HBV surface antigen-positive chronic-disease patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been reported. However, the appropriate duration for this prophylactic therapy is unclear. Here, we report 2 cases of fatal fulminant hepatitis B reactivation in HSCT patients after lamivudine withdrawal. One patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma completed 6 courses of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], and prednisone) and autologous peripheral blood SCT (PBSCT). Lamivudine was discontinued 3 months after transplantation. The second patient had acute myeloid leukemia. He received induction chemotherapy and postremission allogeneic PBSCT as late intensified consolidation therapy. Lamivudine treatment was discontinued 10 months after transplantation. In both patients, HBV reactivation 2 to 3 months following lamivudine cessation led to fatal fulminant hepatitis. We suggest that the duration of prophylactic use of lamivudine in chronic HBV carriers receiving HSCT be prolonged until the patient's immune system has been reconstituted.","['Lin, Peng-Chan', 'Poh, Say-Bee', 'Lee, Ming-Yang', 'Hsiao, Liang-Tsai', 'Chen, Po-Min', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye']","['Lin PC', 'Poh SB', 'Lee MY', 'Hsiao LT', 'Chen PM', 'Chiou TJ']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, National Yang-Ming University, School of Medicine, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatitis B/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Liver Failure, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/07/30 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['QLJPH4NGNTNJL700 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.A10411 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 May;81(4):349-51. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.A10411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administered 400 mg of imatinib mesylate after the diagnosis of chronic-phase CML, the patient achieved a complete cytogenetic remission 4 months later. However, he developed a mixed myeloid/B-cell blast crisis with additional karyotype abnormalities only in the CNS during a complete cytogenetic remission in the bone marrow. Several doses of intrathecal chemotherapy and whole-brain irradiation were effective in treating the blast crisis in the CNS. After 7 months of complete cytogenetic remission, the patient experienced a subcutaneous tumor in the right neck. A biopsy of the tumor revealed a mixed myeloid/T-cell blast crisis. The cytogenetic analysis showed that the blast crisis clone in the neck tumor was different from that of the CNS. An increased dose of imatinib mesylate was ineffective in treating the neck tumor. Irradiation to the right neck was therefore undertaken. This case suggests that the development of a clone resistant to imatinib mesylate is not always detected in the bone marrow and that multiple Ph-positive clones have the potential to become transformed into a blast crisis.","['Matsuda, Mitsuhiro', 'Morita, Yasuyoshi', 'Shimada, Takahiro', 'Miyatake, Junichi', 'Hirase, Chikara', 'Tanaka, Miyako', 'Tatsumi, Yoichi', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Kanamaru, Akihisa']","['Matsuda M', 'Morita Y', 'Shimada T', 'Miyatake J', 'Hirase C', 'Tanaka M', 'Tatsumi Y', 'Maeda Y', 'Kanamaru A']","['Division of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka 589-8511, Japan. matsuda@int3.med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/07/30 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['H7YEKV2591H8BAKW [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.04188 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 May;81(4):307-9. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.04188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Polycomb group (PcG) genes, which counteract trxG genes, were found to play essential roles in hematopoiesis, little has been understood about the roles of trxG genes in hematopoiesis except for MLL. MLL has been found fused with 1 of more than 30 different partner genes to yield a diverse collection of MLL fusion oncoproteins that lead to the aberrant expression of HOX genes. Recent studies have revealed that MLL assembles, as do some trxG proteins, into a chromatin-modifying transcriptional regulatory supercomplex to regulate epigenetic pathways, including the methylation of histone H3 lysine 4, which is conferred by the Su (var)3-9, enhancer of zeste, and tritho-rax (SET) domain. Other studies also indicated that MLL plays a nonredundant and essential role in definitive hematopoiesis and induces the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors by maintaining appropriate up-regulation of HOX genes. Further progress in the field will provide novel insights into trxG- and PcG-mediated hematopoiesis and help us understand the epigenetic process by which developing stem cells coordinate proliferation and differentiation.","['Ono, Ryoichi', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Ono R', 'Nosaka T', 'Hayashi Y']","['Division of Hematopoietic Factors, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/07/30 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['NR3NXLHRLK8MQYMM [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.04196 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 May;81(4):288-93. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.04196.,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vital dye-exclusion, oxidative metabolism of chromogenic dyes, and clonogenic growth profiles were monitored to assess rates of cellular proliferation; our results demonstrate that TF5 restricted HL-60 cell growth, an influence that exhibited comparable potency and efficacy among all three indices. This antiproliferative activity was labile, insofar as medium conditioned in HL-60 cells for 24 h became devoid of the initial growth-suppressive activity after 24-h culture when subsequently administered to naive cultures. Review of cytoarchitectural traits, chromatin staining by TUNEL, and fluorescent cytometric analyses demonstrated that TF5 failed to elicit apoptosis, however, suggesting that this material instead drove treated cells into growth arrest and an unanticipated cytostasis. Qualitatively similar responses were noted in the human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937. Partial purification of TF5 by FPLC yielded a component containing an antiproliferative activity associated with the approximately 1000-Da fraction. These results demonstrate that TF5 contains a sub-fraction possessing a growth-suppressive activity capable of restraining normal proliferation of human myeloid neoplasms via the apparent induction of true cytostasis.","['Spangelo, Bryan L', 'Pompilius, Melissa', 'Farrimond, Derald D', 'Stevens, Nicole', 'Nieva, Ria', 'Shroff, Sachin', 'Badamchian, Mahnaz', 'Johnson, Charlene R', 'Jarvis, W David']","['Spangelo BL', 'Pompilius M', 'Farrimond DD', 'Stevens N', 'Nieva R', 'Shroff S', 'Badamchian M', 'Johnson CR', 'Jarvis WD']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada-Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89154, United States. spangelo@ccmail.nevada.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (thymosin fraction 5)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/*pharmacology']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(05)00100-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2005.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2005 Jul;5(7-8):1317-29. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2005.04.001.,,['K01 CA-82404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent apoptosis after G2/M blockage was demonstrated through DNA fragmentation and the annexin V staining assay. Methyl protodioscin induced a biphasic alteration (i.e. an early hyperpolarization, followed by depolarization) in mitochondrial membrane potential of K562 cells. The transient decline of intracellular Ca2+ concentration was observed at early stage. The generation of reactive oxygen species was also detected. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) transiently increased and then decreased. And the pro-apoptotic Bax was markedly up-regulated.

Whereas elevated mRNA levels of the Fos gene could not be correlated with provirus presence, in one case, Northern blot analysis as well as quantitative real-time PCR indicated proviral activation of the AP-1 super family member Batf, a gene not previously reported to be a target of insertional mutagenesis. A novel integration cluster between Jdp2 and Batf apparently did not influence the expression level of either gene, underscoring the importance of addressing expression effects to identify target genes of insertion. Altogether, such distinct insertion patterns point to different mechanism of activation of specific proto-oncogenes and are consequently of importance for the understanding of proviral activation mechanisms as well as the specific role of individual oncogenes in tumor development.","['Rasmussen, M H', 'Sorensen, A B', 'Morris, D W', 'Dutra, J C', 'Engelhard, E K', 'Wang, C L', 'Schmidt, J', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Rasmussen MH', 'Sorensen AB', 'Morris DW', 'Dutra JC', 'Engelhard EK', 'Wang CL', 'Schmidt J', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a modeling-based analysis that incorporates previously unanalyzed confounders in exploring the exposure-response relationship between cumulative external ionizing radiation exposure and mortality from these cancers among radiation-monitored workers in this cohort. The main analyses were carried out with Poisson regression fitted with maximum likelihood in linear excess relative risk models. Sensitivity analyses varying model components and using other regression models were conducted. The positive association between lung cancer risk and ionizing radiation observed previously was no longer present after adjusting for socioeconomic status (smoking surrogate) and welding fume and asbestos exposures. Excesses of leukemia were found to be positively, though not significantly, associated with external ionizing radiation, with or without including potential confounders. The estimated excess relative risk was 10.88% (95% CI -0.90%, 38.77%) per 10 mSv of radiation exposure, which was within the ranges of risk estimates in previous epidemiological studies (-4.1 to 19.0%).

The accumulation of neoplastically transformed B-lymphocytes (CLL cells) is primarily the consequence of apoptosis blocking in these cells. Bcl-2 proteins are well-known modulators of this process. Some of these proteins are anti-apoptotic while the others are pro-apoptotic. All contain at least one of the four conserved regions called the Bcl-2 homologous domains (BH1-BH4). Evidence indicates that Bcl-2 and Bax form homo- and heterodimers. The anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 protein is based on its ability to bind Bax protein in the heterodimer form, and thus to block the forming of Bax/Bax proapoptotic homodimers. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax represents the cell autonomous rheostat which determinates the type of the cell reaction to an apoptotic stimulus. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the level of interaction between these two proteins in CLL cells using the co-immunoprecipition method. The study included the analysis of 20 peripheral blood specimens from 20 patients with CLL, and 20 peripheral blood specimens from healthy persons, who were in the control group. Specimens were precipitated with the monoclonal antibody for Bcl-2 protein, and immunoblotted with the palyclonal antibady for Bax protein (IP: Bcl-2/WB:Bax). At the same time, specimens were precipitated with the polyclonal antibody for Bax protein, and immunoblotted with the monoclonal antibody for Bcl-2 protein (IP: Bax/WB:Bcl-2). The intensity of Bcl-2 and Bax protein's binding compared to the control samples of the peripheral blood from healthy persons, was increased in CLL cells. RESULTS: IP: Bax/WB: Bcl-2 showed a high level of ""free"" Bcl-2 protein which was not bound in the heterodimer form to Bax protein. Simultaneously IP: Bcl-2/WB: Bax showed that a higher quantity of Bax protein was bound in the heterodimer form to Bcl-2 protein as opposed to the quantity of pro-apoptotic Bax protein potentialy bound in the homodimer form. CONCLUSION: Further studies involving larger groups of patients are necessary to explore the potential significance of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio as a prognositc parameter in the CLL treatment.","['Brajuskovic, Goran', 'Orolicki, Slobodanka Vukosavic', 'Cerovic, Snezana', 'Usaj, Slavica Knezevic', 'Marjanovic, Slobodan', 'Romac, Stanka']","['Brajuskovic G', 'Orolicki SV', 'Cerovic S', 'Usaj SK', 'Marjanovic S', 'Romac S']","['ZPSM - Institut za patologiju, Crnotravska 17, 11040 Beograd, Srbija i Cma Gora. brajuskovic@hotmail.com']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/vsp0505357b [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2005 May;62(5):357-63. doi: 10.2298/vsp0505357b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were diagnosed at the outpatient clinic of the School of Dentistry at the University of Antioquia, at the University Hospital Saint Vincent of Paul, at the Luz Castro de Gutierrez University Hospital, at the Red Cross Hospital and at the private office of one of the authors (Jimenez L., M) in Medellin, Colombia, from 1965 until 2000. Almost all the patients came from low socioeconomic groups and presented with predisposing and/or contributing factors, such as acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, measles, and leukemia (including acute lymphoblastic and chronic lymphoid leukemia). Malnutrition and poor oral hygiene were associated with the necrotizing process and favored progression from the gingiva to deeper periodontal tissues and other structures within the oral cavity or the facial tissues. No patients had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS, which makes these findings different from other reports. Noma can be prevented by vaccinating children against infectious diseases, by controlling malnutrition and by improving their oral hygiene. It is arrested by mechanical lesion debridement, improving oral hygiene and antibiotic therapy. Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis may progress in some cases to ulcerative necrotizing stomatitis, necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis, and, finally, to noma. Microbial studies among new Colombian NUG, NUP and noma patients are necessary, using bacterial culturing and identification methods and molecular techniques such as PCR for viruses and bacteria, in order to establish the exact nature of these lesions.","['Jimenez, L Mario', 'Duque, Francisco L', 'Baer, Paul N', 'Jimenez, Sol Beatriz']","['Jimenez LM', 'Duque FL', 'Baer PN', 'Jimenez SB']","['University of Antioquia, School of Dentistry, Medellin Colombia. mjimenez@chami.udea.edu.co']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Int Acad Periodontol,Journal of the International Academy of Periodontology,100888553,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colombia', 'Female', 'Gingiva/pathology', 'Gingivitis, Necrotizing Ulcerative/drug therapy/microbiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/complications', 'Measles/complications', 'Noma/drug therapy/microbiology/*pathology']",2005/05/26 09:00,2005/09/28 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Int Acad Periodontol. 2005 Apr;7(2):55-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among its renal targets, mesangial cells have been widely studied: they have both retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) and the cell growth is inhibited when human mesangial cells are incubated with 1-10 microM AR-t. Although his effect has been related with the antiproliferative action of AR-t, there are no studies on the involvement of apoptosis in AR-t induced cell growth when higher concentrations of retinoid are used. Our studies show that 25 microM AR-t triggers mesangial cell apoptosis assessed by light and fluorescence microscopy (Giemsa stain and acridine orange stain, respectively), DNA electrophoresis, flow cytometry (annexin-V) and immunocytochemistry (TUNEL). AR-t induced apoptosis was not inhibited by preincubation with the RXR pan-antagonist HX531 nor with the RAR pan-antagonist AGN 193109, this suggesting RAR and RXIR are not involved in AR-t induced cell death. Previous results of our group showed that ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) and INK (c-Jun kinase), two members of the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase family, are involved in non apoptotic effects of AR-t on mesangial cells. Therefore we focussed on the stress activated p38 kinase, the third member of the MAPK family, to investigate its involvement in AR-t induced apoptosis. The results confirmed a role of p38 since: 1) preincubation with B5203589, a p38 inhibitor, inhibited ARA induced apoptosis; 2) incubation with AR-t induced p38 phosphorilation after few minutes and p38 remained phosphorilated for at least 8 hours and 3) AR-t induced p38 phosphorilation was inhibited by SB203589. These data suggest that AR-t might have toxic side effects on the kidney but also suggest that AR-t could be an useful inhibitor of pathological mesangial cell expansion.","['Sepulveda, J C', 'Moreno Manzano, V', 'Alique, M', 'Reyes, P', 'Calvino, M', 'Perez de Hornedo, J', 'Parra, T', 'Lucio, F J']","['Sepulveda JC', 'Moreno Manzano V', 'Alique M', 'Reyes P', 'Calvino M', 'Perez de Hornedo J', 'Parra T', 'Lucio FJ']","['Departamento de Fisiologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Nefrologia,Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia,8301215,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glomerular Mesangium/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology']",2005/05/26 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/05/26 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Nefrologia. 2005;25(2):131-6, 138, 140.",,,,,,,,,,El acido retinoico todo-trans induce apoptosis en celulas mesangiales humanas: implicacion de la quinasa activada por estres p38.,,,,

METHODS: By means of a mail questionnaire, information on a series of 37 patients with a diagnosis of AL during pregnancy was collected from 13 French centers between December, 1988 and November, 2003. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 6 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Nine patients were diagnosed during the first trimester, 10 patients were diagnosed during the second trimester, and 18 patients were diagnosed during the third trimester. Fifteen pregnancies ended with therapeutic or spontaneous abortion. There were 13 normal deliveries, including 1 gemellary pregnancy, and 9 Cesarean sections. Twenty-three healthy babies survived from the 37 pregnancies, of whom 15 babies had been exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. A complete remission was achieved in 34 patients. Eleven women had severe extrahematologic complications during the induction remission course. The median disease-free survival (DFS) was not reached, with a 5-year DFS of 54%. Ten patients developed recurrent disease. Overall, 12 of 37 pregnant women died from leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy does not affect the course of AL. In the first trimester, termination of pregnancy should be discussed because of the potential fetal consequences of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy treatment during the second or third trimester may not require termination of pregnancy, because as remission of AL and delivery of a normal infant are likely to be obtained.","['Chelghoum, Youcef', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Witz, Brigitte', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Garban, Frederic', 'Saad, Hussam', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Chelghoum Y', 'Vey N', 'Raffoux E', 'Huguet F', 'Pigneux A', 'Witz B', 'Pautas C', 'de Botton S', 'Guyotat D', 'Lioure B', 'Fegueux N', 'Garban F', 'Saad H', 'Thomas X']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Remission Induction']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/08/23 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21137 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jul 1;104(1):110-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21137.,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Common risk scores (PRISM, PRISM III, APACHE-II) fail to predict mortality in these patients. A retrospective chart analysis of 32 paediatric cancer patients admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at the University Hospital of Saarland between January 2001 and December 2003 for life-threatening complications was performed. The aim of this study was to assess risk factors for short-term outcome (survival vs. non-survival when leaving the PICU) and to develop a risk score to estimate outcome in these patients. Overall survival was good (25 of 32 patients). Mortality rate was significantly related to leukaemia/lymphoma ( P = 0.029), to the number of organ failures ( P < 0.0001), neutropenia ( P = 0.001), septic shock ( P = 0.025), mechanical ventilation ( P = 0.01) and inotropic support ( P = 0.01). Employing multiple logistic regression, the strongest predictor for poor outcome was the number of organ failures ( P < 0.05). A risk score (cut-off value: >3 points for non-survival) which included the following risk factors (non-solid tumour, number of organ failures ( n > 2), neutropenia, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and inotropic medication) yielded a sensitivity of 7/7 (95% CI: 4.56-7.00), a specificity of 23/25 (95% CI: 18.49-24.75), a positive predictive value of 23/23 (95% CI: 19.80-23.00), and a negative predictive value of 7/9 (95% CI: 3.60-8.74) for the time of admission to the PICU. CONCLUSION: Although our risk of mortality score is of prognostic value in assessing short-term outcome in these patients, prospective validation in a larger study cohort is mandatory. Furthermore, it must be emphasised that this risk score must not be used for decision-making in an individual patient.","['Meyer, Sascha', 'Gottschling, Sven', 'Biran, Tamir', 'Georg, Thomas', 'Ehlayil, Karim', 'Graf, Norbert', 'Gortner, Ludwig']","['Meyer S', 'Gottschling S', 'Biran T', 'Georg T', 'Ehlayil K', 'Graf N', 'Gortner L']","['Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Saarland, Kirrbergerstrasse, 66421 Homburg, Germany. sascha.meyer@uniklinik-saarland.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', '*Child Mortality', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals, University/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Intensive Care Units, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality/therapy', '*Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/05/25 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2005/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00431-005-1695-y [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2005 Sep;164(9):563-7. doi: 10.1007/s00431-005-1695-y.

Despite the progress made in the understanding of the biology of cHL, the transforming events remain to be elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated that the Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 blocked cellular proliferation and STAT3 phosphorylation in cHL. To explore the potential of constitutively activated STAT3 as a drug target and its role in cHL pathogenesis, different cHL cell lines were analyzed. Treatment of cHL cells by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG17 was associated with inhibition of cellular proliferation and cell cycle arrest. AG17 treatment was accompanied by decreased levels of STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas NF-kappaB and p38/SAPK2 signaling were not inhibited. Incubation with AG17 or AG490 sensitized cHL cells to CD95/Fas/Apo-1 or staurosporine-mediated apoptosis. Coincubation of tyrphostins with staurosporine was accompanied by rapid complete inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. RNA interference directed against STAT3 in L428 and L1236 cHL cells demonstrated that STAT3 is essential for cell proliferation of these cHL cells. In conclusion, these findings support the concept that STAT3 signaling is important in the pathogenesis of cHL and tyrphostins are agents for developing new therapeutic strategies.","['Holtick, U', 'Vockerodt, M', 'Pinkert, D', 'Schoof, N', 'Sturzenhofecker, B', 'Kussebi, N', 'Lauber, K', 'Wesselborg, S', 'Loffler, D', 'Horn, F', 'Trumper, L', 'Kube, D']","['Holtick U', 'Vockerodt M', 'Pinkert D', 'Schoof N', 'Sturzenhofecker B', 'Kussebi N', 'Lauber K', 'Wesselborg S', 'Loffler D', 'Horn F', 'Trumper L', 'Kube D']","['Universitat zu Koln, Klinik fur Innere Medizin I, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '51601-81-1 (SF 6847)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nitriles', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403750 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403750 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):936-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403750.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the safety of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from two or three loci-mismatched related donors using alemtuzumab in vivo. METHODS: A total body irradiation-based regimen was used in young patients, whereas those 50 years or older received fludarabine-based conditioning. Alemtuzumab was added to these regimens by intravenous infusion at 0.2 mg/kg per day for 6 days (days -8 to -3). RESULTS: We treated 12 patients with a median age of 49.5 years. Eight patients demonstrated active disease, and four patients demonstrated acute leukemia in high-risk remission. All achieved neutrophil engraftment a median of 17.5 days after transplantation with complete donor-type chimerism. The cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was only 9%. Infection-related deaths were not observed. CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T cells were strongly suppressed within 2 months after transplantation, but recovered on day 90. Relapse was observed in five of eight patients who underwent transplantation for active disease, whereas none of the three patients who underwent transplantation in first remission had a relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in vivo alemtuzumab enables haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation without ex vivo graft manipulation.","['Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Asano-Mori, Yuki', 'Kandabashi, Koji', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Izutsu, Koji', 'Hangaishi, Akira', 'Tsujino, Shiho', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Motokura, Toru', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Hirai, Hisamaru']","['Kanda Y', 'Oshima K', 'Asano-Mori Y', 'Kandabashi K', 'Nakagawa M', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Izutsu K', 'Hangaishi A', 'Tsujino S', 'Ogawa S', 'Motokura T', 'Chiba S', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital, Hongo, Tokyo, Japan. ycanda-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', '*Haplotypes', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/06/28 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200505270-00016 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000158718.49286.14 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2005 May 27;79(10):1351-7. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000158718.49286.14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental models that mimic the dissemination of ALL have been difficult to establish, principally due to the poor engraftment efficiency of normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells in various strains of immune-deficient mice. The recent availability of mouse strains that are even more immunocompromised than established strains such as the nude (nu/nu) or severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse has presented opportunities to establish improved experimental models of human leukemia. In this chapter we outline the methodology to (1) establish continuous xenografts from primary childhood ALL biopsies in nonobese diabetic/SCID (NOD/SCID) mice and (2) utilize these xenograft models of systemic disease to test established and experimental drugs while monitoring leukemia progression in ""real time"" by serial monitoring of murine peripheral blood.

The molecular mechanism responsible for the anti-cancer effects of celecoxib is not fully understood. There is little data on the potential role of COX-2 in lymphoma pathogenesis. In view of the reported induction of apoptosis in cancer cells by cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, the present study is undertaken to test the effect of celecoxib on human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line, K562 and other hematopoietic cancer cell lines like Jurkat (human T lymphocytes), HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) and U937 (human macrophage). Treatment of these cells with celecoxib (10-100 microM) dose-dependently, reduced cell growth with arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis. Further mechanism of apoptosis induction was elucidated in detail in K562 cell line. Apoptosis was mediated by release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). This was followed by DNA fragmentation. The level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased without any change in the pro-apoptotic Bax. Celecoxib also inhibited NF-kB activation. Celecoxib thus potentiates apoptosis as shown by MTT assay, cytochrome c leakage, PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, Bcl-2 downregulation and possibly by inhibiting NF-kB activation.","['Subhashini, J', 'Mahipal, S V K', 'Reddanna, P']","['Subhashini J', 'Mahipal SV', 'Reddanna P']","['Department of Animal Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500 046, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Down-Regulation', 'Formazans/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Macrophages', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2004/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00858-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2005 Jun 16;224(1):31-43. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.11.002.

Gain-of-function KIT receptor mutations have been reported in adult AML patients, especially those with core binding factor leukemia (CBFL). We have previously reported a new gain-of-function KIT(Asn822Lys) mutation that is constitutively expressed in the Kasumi-1 CBFL cell line, and has recently been described in two childhood AML patients. To explore the molecular basis of the effects of this mutation in the appropriate context of hemopoietic dysregulation, we investigated KIT downstream signaling in the Kasumi-1 cell line by means of STI 571 (Imatinib, Gleevec) pharmacological inhibition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated KIT(Asn822Lys) mutant-initiated signaling in Kasumi-1 cell line, and characterized the inhibitory effect of the STI 571 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor on downstream signaling. RESULTS: The use of STI 571-mediated inhibition impaired the tyrosine phosphorylation of KIT(Asn822Lys) and its association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (p85PI3K). The downstream constitutive phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and STAT3 was also significantly inhibited, but STI 571 had no effect on the constitutive activation of Akt, thus suggesting that it is due to other signaling in Kasumi-1 cells. STI 571 inhibited the KIT-mediated proliferation of Kasumi-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the role of PI3K in KIT(Asn822Lys)-mediated constitutive activation through the Akt-independent downstream signaling pathway of JNK, and also demonstrate the mutant's susceptibility to STI 571, which may therefore have therapeutic potential in CBFL patients with susceptible KIT mutations.","['Beghini, Alessandro', 'Bellini, Melissa', 'Magnani, Ivana', 'Colapietro, Patrizia', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Larizza, Lidia']","['Beghini A', 'Bellini M', 'Magnani I', 'Colapietro P', 'Cairoli R', 'Morra E', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics for Medical Sciences, Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/genetics', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2004/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00131-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Jun;33(6):682-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.03.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We employed Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) oligonucleotide arrays to compare the gene expression profiles of CIK cells before and after stimulation by different leukemic cells. This includes the generation of six independent sets of CIK effectors against AML and ALL leukemic targets. RESULTS: Majority of the highly expressed genes of the various CD3+CD56+ CIK effectors were regulated in concordance with, and were consistent with, a Th1 and Tc1 polarization. Genes related to protein synthesis were highly expressed in CIK cells, and upon stimulation by leukemic targets, genes related to signaling, immune responses, and transcription were further upregulated. More importantly, and corroborated with their cytolytic activities, the NK receptors genes, NKG2C and NKG2E, together with perforin, were upregulated exclusively in CIK cells that were cytolytic to susceptible AML targets. In comparison, transforming growth factorbeta1, a cytokine with immune inhibitory function, was exclusively upregulated in CIK cells that were exposed to resistant ALL targets. CONCLUSION: In addition to demonstrating the presence of molecular regulatory pathways that are common to CIK effector cells, our present study also reveals molecular events that are unique to CIK effectors on stimulation with cytolytic-susceptible (AML) or cytolytic-resistant (ALL) targets. These observations could allow the design of strategies for future research on the application of CIK effector cells for cancer immunotherapy.","['Linn, Yeh Ching', 'Wang, Suk Mei', 'Hui, Kam M']","['Linn YC', 'Wang SM', 'Hui KM']","['Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00130-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Jun;33(6):671-81. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.03.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA interference studies for HSP27 in leukemic TF-1 cells were used to investigate the effects on downstream signal transduction and apoptosis after VP-16 and CD95/Fas treatment. HSP27 expression and activation was investigated in AML blasts through Western blot analysis. RESULTS: RNA interference for HSP27 resulted in a twofold increase in VP-16-induced apoptosis, which was preceded by enhanced p38 and c-Jun phosphorylation and a twofold increased cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. DAXX co-immunoprecipitated with HSP27, suggesting an inhibitory role of HSP27 in VP-16-mediated activation of the ASK1/p38/JNK pathway. CD95/Fas-induced apoptosis, however, was unaffected by HSP27 siRNA, due to upregulation of HSP27. Although HSP27 was highly expressed and phosphorylated in primitive monocytic AML blasts (M4-M5, 91%, n=11) and undetectable in myeloid blasts (M1-M2, n=5), VP-16-mediated apoptosis correlated moderately with HSP27 expression. This is likely due to the co-expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, which is in the majority of the monocytic AML M4-M5 blasts constitutively localized in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of cytoplasmic p21 inhibited the enhanced p38 phosphorylation after HSP27 RNAi, suggesting a predominant anti-apoptotic role of p21 over HSP27. CONCLUSION: 1) HSP27 inhibits VP-16-mediated phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun, cytochrome c release, and subsequent apoptosis; 2) HSP27 is expressed and activated in monocytic AML blasts; 3) cytoplasmic expression of p21 compensates for the lack of HSP27.","['Schepers, Hein', 'Geugien, Marjan', 'van der Toorn, Marco', 'Bryantsev, Anton L', 'Kampinga, Harm H', 'Eggen, Bart J L', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Schepers H', 'Geugien M', 'van der Toorn M', 'Bryantsev AL', 'Kampinga HH', 'Eggen BJ', 'Vellenga E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2005/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00133-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.03.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Jun;33(6):660-70. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.03.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we found a second N-acylethanolamine hydrolase in animal tissues which hydrolyzed anandamide at acidic pH. This ""acid amidase"" was first detected with the particulate fraction of human megakaryoblastic CMK cells, and was solubilized by freezing and thawing without detergent. The enzyme was distinguishable from FAAH in terms of (1) the optimal activity at pH 5, (2) stimulation by dithiothreitol, (3) low sensitivity to two FAAH inhibitors (methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and (4) high content in lung, spleen and macrophages of rat. The acid amidase purified from rat lung was the most active with N-palmitoylethanolamine among various long-chain N-acylethanolamines. To develop specific inhibitors for this enzyme, we screened various analogues of N-palmitoylethanolamine. Among the tested compounds, N-cyclohexanecarbonylpentadecylamine was the most potent inhibitor which does-dependently inhibited the enzyme with an IC(50) value of 4.5 microM without inhibiting FAAH at concentrations up to 100 microM.

The mechanism of action is currently unknown, but may rely on complement-mediated cell lysis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was to assess the proapoptotic activity of alemtuzumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to describe pathways potentially underlying this effect. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 21 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were treated in vitro in the absence of complement with fludarabine alone, alemtuzumab alone, or with the additional presence of a cross-linking anti-Fc-antibody. Apoptosis was quantified after 24 h by flow cytometry analysis. Expression of several pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins was determined at different time points. Apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with alemtuzumab alone was significantly enhanced compared to untreated cells suggesting a minor potentially cytotoxic mechanism by direct signaling independent from antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The presence of a cross-linking anti-Fc-antibody induced the formation of cell clusters and enhanced apoptosis significantly suggesting a potential role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in alemtuzumab induced apoptosis. Alemtuzumab activated a CD52-dependent signaling pathway which induced a significant increase in caspase 3 and 8 expression. Alemtuzumab significantly enhances apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro, especially in combination with a cross-linking anti-Fc-antibody, this effect being mediated by a caspase-dependent pathway.","['Nuckel, Holger', 'Frey, Ulrich H', 'Roth, Alexander', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Siffert, Winfried']","['Nuckel H', 'Frey UH', 'Roth A', 'Duhrsen U', 'Siffert W']","['Department of Hematology, Medical School, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. holger.nueckel@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/05/25 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2004/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(05)00322-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2005 May 9;514(2-3):217-24. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.03.024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment of leukemia with retinoids is aimed on the induction of leukemic cells differentiation. However the interconnections between retinoid regulated differentiation of leukemic cells and regulation of MDR remains unclear. METHODS: Four lines of cultured leukemic cells of diverse types of differentiation were infected with RARalpha gene and stable transfectants were isolated. We investigated the differentiation of these cells as well as the expression of RARalpha and MDR1 genes and P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR protein) functional activity in these cells. RESULTS: All RARalpha transfected sublines demonstrated the increase in the quantity of RARalpha mRNA. All these sublines became more differentiated. Intrinsic activity of MDR1 gene (but not Pgp functional activity) was increased in one of the transfectants. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induced Pgp activity in two of three infectants to a larger extent than in parental cells.

Adaptation of proviral load measurement techniques is examined here for use in an experimental rabbit model of HTLV-1 infection. Initial efforts sought to correlate proviral load with route and dose of inoculation and with clinical outcome in this model. These methods contribute to our continuing goal of using the model to test treatments that alleviate virus infection. RESULTS: A real-time PCR assay was used to measure proviral load in blood and tissue samples from a series of rabbits infected using HTLV-1 inocula prepared as either cell-free virus particles, infected cells or blood, or by naked DNA injection. Proviral loads from asymptomatically infected rabbits showed levels corresponding to those reported for human patients with clinically silent HTLV-1 infections. Proviral load was comparably increased in 50% of experimentally infected rabbits that developed either spontaneous benign or malignant tumors while infected. Similarly elevated provirus was found in organs of rabbits with experimentally induced acute leukemia/lymphoma-like disease. Levels of provirus in organs taken at necropsy varied widely suggesting that reservoirs of infections exist in non-lymphoid organs not traditionally thought to be targets for HTLV-1. CONCLUSION: Proviral load measurement is a valuable enhancement to the rabbit model for HTLV-1 infection providing a metric to monitor clinical status of the infected animals as well as a means for the testing of treatment to combat infection. In some cases proviral load in blood did not reflect organ proviral levels, revealing a limitation of this method for monitoring health status of HTLV-1 infected individuals.","['Zhao, Tong-Mao', 'Hague, Bishop', 'Caudell, David L', 'Simpson, R Mark', 'Kindt, Thomas J']","['Zhao TM', 'Hague B', 'Caudell DL', 'Simpson RM', 'Kindt TJ']","['Molecular and Cellular Immunogenetics Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bldg #50, Room 5515, 50 South Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. tzhao@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/blood', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Rabbits', '*Viral Load']",2005/05/25 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/05/25 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-34 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-34 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 May 23;2:34. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-34.,,,20050523,,,PMC1156951,,,,,,,,

Vanishment of thymic epithelial cells especially in the cortex and marked depletion of CD4 CD8 double-positive thymocytes were evident in the neonatal thymus in these rats. The relative abundance of CD8 compared to CD4 T cells may be related to dominant infiltration of CD8 T cells into the affected organs. Additionally, adoptive transfer of FW-pX splenocytes could induce lymphocytic infiltration into sublethally irradiated wild-type syngeneic recipients. Analysis of the expression level of the Foxp3 gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that the numbers of immunoregulatory T cells were less in FW-pX rats than in wild-type rats. The collective evidence suggested that the FW-pX rats spontaneously developed chronic GVHD-like autoimmune diseases, following abortive differentiation of T cells in the thymus in early days of the newborn.

It has been previously shown that pramanicin induces cell death and increases calcium levels in vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we showed that pramanicin induced apoptosis in Jurkat T leukemia cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Our data reveal that pramanicin induced the release of cytochrome c and caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, as evidenced by detection of active caspase fragments and fluorometric caspase assays. Pramanicin also activated c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2) with different time and dose kinetics. Treatment of cells with specific MAP kinase and caspase inhibitors further confirmed the mechanistic involvement of these signalling cascades in pramanicin-induced apoptosis. JNK and p38 pathways acted as pro-apoptotic signalling pathways in pramanicin-induced apoptosis, in which they regulated release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. In contrast the ERK 1/2 pathway exerted a protective effect through inhibition of cytochrome c leakage from mitochondria and caspase activation, which were only observed when lower concentrations of pramanicin were used as apoptosis-inducing agent and which were masked by the intense apoptosis induction by higher concentrations of pramanicin. These results suggest pramanicin as a potential apoptosis-inducing small molecule, which acts through a well-defined JNK- and p38-dependent apoptosis signalling pathway in Jurkat T leukemia cells.","['Kutuk, O', 'Pedrech, A', 'Harrison, P', 'Basaga, H']","['Kutuk O', 'Pedrech A', 'Harrison P', 'Basaga H']","['Biological Sciences and Bioengineering Program, Sabanci University, 34956 Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Lactams)', '0 (pramanicin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epoxy Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/09/28 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-005-1894-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2005 May;10(3):597-609. doi: 10.1007/s10495-005-1894-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 28-33% apoptosis was observed in cells treated under conditions 1 and 2, but this value was significantly reduced to around 18-20% in cells treated under conditions 3 and 4, suggesting that post-irradiation hypoxic incubation rather than hypoxic irradiation mainly caused the reduction of apoptosis. The activation and expression of apoptosis signal-related molecules SAPK/JNK, Fas and caspase-3 were also suppressed by hypoxic incubation. Effects of hypoxic incubation were canceled when cells were treated under conditions 3 and 4 with an oxygen-mimicking hypoxic cell radiosensitizer, whereas the addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine again reduced the induction of apoptosis. From these results it was concluded that hypoxia reduced the induction of apoptosis by changing the intracellular redox state, followed by the regulation of apoptotic signals in X-irradiated MOLT-4 cells.","['Hamasu, T', 'Inanami, O', 'Tsujitani, M', 'Yokoyama, K', 'Takahashi, E', 'Kashiwakura, I', 'Kuwabara, M']","['Hamasu T', 'Inanami O', 'Tsujitani M', 'Yokoyama K', 'Takahashi E', 'Kashiwakura I', 'Kuwabara M']","['Laboratory of Radiation Biology, Department of Environmental Veterinary Sciences, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '911XR034RX (doranidazole)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*physiopathology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/09/28 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-005-1888-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2005 May;10(3):557-67. doi: 10.1007/s10495-005-1888-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF-kB also plays an important role in human diseases by promoting inappropriate cell survival. Small molecule inhibitors of NF-kB are therefore likely to provide novel therapeutic opportunities. Sulfasalazine (SFZ) is a synthetic anti-inflammatory comprising an aminosalicylate, 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA), linked to an antibiotic, sulfapyridine (SPY). SFZ, but not 5-ASA or SPY, inhibits activation of NF-kB. We synthesised a small number of SFZ analogues and determined their ability to inhibit NF-kB activity and promote apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and hepatic stellate cells, where NF-kB plays an important role in cell survival. Remarkably, 3 of the 6 analogues synthesised were significantly more effective (up to 8-fold) inhibitors of NF-kB dependent transcription and this increased activity was associated with enhanced apoptosis. Therefore, it is possible to readily improve the NF-kB inhibiting activity of SFZ and analogues of SFZ may be attractive therapeutic agents for malignancies and chronic liver disease where NF-kB is thought to play a significant role.","['Habens, F', 'Srinivasan, N', 'Oakley, F', 'Mann, D A', 'Ganesan, A', 'Packham, G']","['Habens F', 'Srinivasan N', 'Oakley F', 'Mann DA', 'Ganesan A', 'Packham G']","['Cancer Research UK Oncology Unit, Cancer Sciences Division, School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton, SO16 6YD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, rat)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '3XC8GUZ6CB (Sulfasalazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Male', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Sulfasalazine/*analogs & derivatives']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/09/28 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-005-1877-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2005 May;10(3):481-91. doi: 10.1007/s10495-005-1877-0.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In all, 58 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) at our institution were retrospectively analyzed for a correlation between the development of aGVHD and leukemic relapse. Probability of relapse after 5 (3) years was 13% (7%) in patients developing grade II-IV aGVHD vs 30% in patients with grade 0 or I aGVHD. There was a trend for a difference of the point estimates at 3 years, but no overall significance because of an unusual late relapse. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of cyclosporin A (CsA) on aGVHD in a subgroup of 22 children who had received a matched sibling donor (MSD) BMT. An increased dose of CsA within the first 2 weeks after BMT led to decreased occurrence and severity of aGVHD (P=0.035). The cumulative CsA dose appeared to have more impact than the average CsA whole-blood levels within the first 2 weeks and than the CsA dose given from day 15 to 40. In this subgroup, no life-threatening aGVHD or death from aGVHD occurred. In all cases (6/22), leukemic relapse was the cause of death. We therefore suggest that there is a relation between dose of CsA and relapse rate in childhood ALL transplanted from a MSD.","['Teuffel, O', 'Schrauder, A', 'Sykora, K W', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Welte, K', 'Schrappe, M']","['Teuffel O', 'Schrauder A', 'Sykora KW', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reiter A', 'Welte K', 'Schrappe M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hannover, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705010 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705010 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jul;36(2):145-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Highest lytic activity (ADCC) was observed against leukemia-derived MHH4 cells and Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Raji cells in the first months after transplantation, corresponding to the high percentage of regenerating CD56+ CD16+ cells. Moreover, primary cryopreserved ALL-blasts from a pediatric patient were also efficiently lysed. Increased lysis was obtained after stimulation with interleukin-2. Combination of ADCC and CDC had additive effects.

In the present study we explored the reverse situation namely the effect of enforcement of hematopoietic lineage cells that are normally maintained in suspension to grow attached. Towards this end murine L1210 or human HL-60 and Jurkat leukemia cells were cultured in slide chambers coated with poly-L- or poly-D- lysine, or with compound 48/80, the polycations attracting them electrostatically. Within minutes after the transfer L1210 cells strongly adhered to bottom surface of the dish and shortly thereafter binuclear-, and later on, polynuclear-cells become apparent. The frequency of nuclei per cell was increasing with time and polykaryons with up to 16 nuclei and high DNA ploidy (DI = 16.0) were apparent after 48 h. After 4 days the size (volume) of some polykaryons exceeded by over 340-fold the volume of mononuclear cells. The presence of mitotic figures and abnormal mitotic spindles in adhering polykaryons provided evidence of the impeded cytokinesis that led to endomitosis. Most polykaryons excluded trypan blue, had balanced growth (unchanged protein/DNA ratio compared to monokaryons), and showed no evidence of apoptosis. Individual nuclei within each polykaryon replicated DNA in synchrony. The strong cell attachment and aborted cytokinesis were cell line specific since no significant endomitosis was observed in Jurkat- or HL-60- cells which did not strongly attach to polycation-coated surfaces. Defective cytokinesis and induction of polyploidy by this mechanism, if occurs in vivo (e.g., mediated by integrins), may lead to aneuploidy and therefore have tumorigenic consequences. The phenomenon offers novel experimental model for induction of polyploidy and provides alternative to cytocholasin B to prevent cytokinesis in the mutagenicity cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay.","['Huang, Xuan', 'Dai, Wei', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Huang X', 'Dai W', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokinesis', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic System/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/metabolism', '*Mitosis', '*Polyploidy']",2005/05/24 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1695 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.6.1695 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Jun;4(6):801-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.6.1695.

Here we show that the murine leukemia virus Gag has the unique ability to interact with all three factors. Small interfering RNAs against Tsg101 or Alix and dominant-negative forms of Nedd4 can all reduce production of virus-like particles. However, inactivating the Nedd4-binding site abolishes budding, whereas disrupting Tsg101 or Alix binding has milder effects. Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases are therefore essential, and Tsg101 and Alix play auxiliary roles. Most interestingly, overexpression of Alix can stimulate the release of Gag, and this occurs independently of most Alix partners Tsg101, Cin85, Alg-2, and endophilins. In addition, Gag mutants that do not bind Tsg101 or Alix concentrate on late endosomes and become very sensitive to dominant-negative forms of Nedd4 that do not conjugate ubiquitin. This suggests that the direct interaction of Gag with Tsg101 and Alix favors budding from the plasma membrane and relieves a requirement for ubiquitination by Nedd4.1. Other Nedd4-dependent Gag proteins also contain binding sites for Tsg101 or Alix, suggesting that this could be a common feature of retroviruses.","['Segura-Morales, Carolina', 'Pescia, Christina', 'Chatellard-Causse, Christine', 'Sadoul, Remy', 'Bertrand, Edouard', 'Basyuk, Eugenia']","['Segura-Morales C', 'Pescia C', 'Chatellard-Causse C', 'Sadoul R', 'Bertrand E', 'Basyuk E']","['IGMM-CNRS, 1919 Route de Mende 34293, Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Pdcd6ip protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (NEDD4L protein, rat)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Nedd4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Nedd4 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Nedd4l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', '*Virus Replication']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)56720-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M413735200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jul 22;280(29):27004-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M413735200.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1994 and April 1997, 93 patients with refractory hematologic malignancies were treated with one to 16 cycles of study drug. Nelarabine was administered daily, as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days, every 21 to 28 days. First-cycle pharmacokinetic data, including plasma nelarabine and araG levels, were obtained on all patients treated. Intracellular phosphorylation of araG was studied in samples of leukemic blasts from selected patients. RESULTS: The MTDs were defined at 60 mg/kg/dose and 40 mg/kg/dose daily x 5 days in children and adults, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was neurologic in both children and adults. Myelosuppression and other significant organ toxicities did not occur. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in children and adults. Accumulation of araGTP in leukemic blasts was correlated with cytotoxic activity. The overall response rate was 31%. Major responses were seen in patients with T-cell malignancies, with 54% of patients with T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieving a complete or partial response after one to two courses of drug. CONCLUSION: Nelarabine is a novel nucleoside with significant cytotoxic activity against malignant T cells. DLT is neurologic. Phase II and III trials in patients with T-cell malignancies are encouraged.","['Kurtzberg, J', 'Ernst, T J', 'Keating, M J', 'Gandhi, V', 'Hodge, J P', 'Kisor, D F', 'Lager, J J', 'Stephens, C', 'Levin, J', 'Krenitsky, T', 'Elion, G', 'Mitchell, B S']","['Kurtzberg J', 'Ernst TJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V', 'Hodge JP', 'Kisor DF', 'Lager JJ', 'Stephens C', 'Levin J', 'Krenitsky T', 'Elion G', 'Mitchell BS']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. kurtz001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/06/25 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/15/3396 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.199 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 20;23(15):3396-403. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.199.,,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to define the response rate of nelarabine in children and young adults with refractory or recurrent T-cell disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a phase II study with patients stratified as follows: stratum 1: > or = 25% bone marrow blasts in first relapse; stratum 2: > or = 25% bone marrow blasts in > or = second relapse; stratum 3: positive CSF; stratum 4: extramedullary (non-CNS) relapse. The initial nelarabine dose was 1.2 g/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. There were two dose de-escalations due to neurotoxicity on this or other studies. The final dose was 650 mg/m2/d for strata 1 and two patients and 400 mg/m2/d for strata 3 and four patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 121 patients (106 assessable for response) at the final dose levels. Complete plus partial response rates at the final dose levels were: 55% in stratum 1; 27% in stratum 2; 33% in stratum 3; and 14% in stratum 4.

Prior to disease manifestation, the immunosuppressive function of CD25(+)CD4(+) T (T-reg) cells was impaired in these rats. Since T cell differentiation appeared to be disordered in env-pX rats, we assumed that the impairment of T-reg cells might be caused by an abortive differentiation in the thymus. However, reciprocal bone marrow transfers between env-pX and wild-type rats revealed that direct effects of the transgene unrelated to the thymus framework induced the abnormality of T-reg cells. To identify molecular changes, comparative analyses were done between env-pX and wild-type T-reg cells. Expression of the Foxp3 gene and cell-surface markers supported a naive phenotype for env-pX T-reg cells. Array analyses of gene expression showed some interesting profiles, e.g. up-regulation of genes associated with the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways in env-pX T-reg cells. Additionally, expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family genes, which inhibit the JAK/STAT signals, was extremely low in env-pX T-reg cells. These findings suggest that the transgene may mediate the down-regulation of the SOCS family genes and that subsequent excess signals through the JAK/STAT pathways may result in the loss of function of env-pX T-reg cells. We suggest that investigation of the pathology of T-reg cells in our autoimmune-prone rat model may aid in understanding the roles of T-reg cells in human autoimmune diseases.","['Hayase, Hiroko', 'Ishizu, Akihiro', 'Ikeda, Hitoshi', 'Miyatake, Yukiko', 'Baba, Tomohisa', 'Higuchi, Masato', 'Abe, Asami', 'Tomaru, Utano', 'Yoshiki, Takashi']","['Hayase H', 'Ishizu A', 'Ikeda H', 'Miyatake Y', 'Baba T', 'Higuchi M', 'Abe A', 'Tomaru U', 'Yoshiki T']","['Department of Pathology/Pathophysiology, Division of Pathophysiological Science, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, rat)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Socs1 protein, rat)', '0 (Socs2 protein, rat)', '0 (Socs3 protein, rat)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Male', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology']",2005/05/24 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxh238 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxh238 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2005 Jun;17(6):677-84. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxh238.

We therefore examined the kinetic profile of gene expression of innate host defense molecules in normal human monocytes infected with C. albicans using microarray technology. Freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes from five healthy donors were incubated with C. albicans for 0 to 18 h in parallel with time-matched uninfected control cells. RNA from monocytes was extracted and amplified for microarray analysis, using a 42,421-gene cDNA chip. Expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor, was markedly enhanced during the first 6 h and coincided with an increase in phagocytosis. Expression of these genes returned to near baseline by 18 h. Genes encoding chemokines, including IL-8; macrophage inflammatory proteins 1, 3, and 4; and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, also were strongly up-regulated, with peak expression at 4 to 6 h, as were genes encoding chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR5, CCR7, and CXCR5. Expression of genes whose products may protect monocyte viability, such as BCL2-related protein, metallothioneins, CD71, and SOCS3, was up-regulated at 4 to 6 h and remained elevated throughout the 18-h time course. On the other hand, expression of genes encoding T-cell-regulatory molecules (e.g., IL-12, gamma interferon, and transforming growth factor beta) was not significantly affected during the 18-h incubation. Moreover, genes encoding IL-15, the IL-13 receptor (IL-13Ra1), and CD14 were suppressed during the 18-h exposure to C. albicans. Thus, C. albicans is a potent inducer of a dynamic cascade of expression of genes whose products are related to the recruitment, activation, and protection of neutrophils and monocytes.","['Kim, Hee Sup', 'Choi, Eun Hwa', 'Khan, Javed', 'Roilides, Emmanuel', 'Francesconi, Andrea', 'Kasai, Miki', 'Sein, Tin', 'Schaufele, Robert L', 'Sakurai, Kenichi', 'Son, Chang Gue', 'Greer, Braden T', 'Chanock, Stephen', 'Lyman, Caron A', 'Walsh, Thomas J']","['Kim HS', 'Choi EH', 'Khan J', 'Roilides E', 'Francesconi A', 'Kasai M', 'Sein T', 'Schaufele RL', 'Sakurai K', 'Son CG', 'Greer BT', 'Chanock S', 'Lyman CA', 'Walsh TJ']","['Immunocompromised Host Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute/NIH, Room 1-5740, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (IL23A protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-23)', '0 (Interleukin-23 Subunit p19)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Candida albicans/*immunology', 'Chemokines/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/genetics', 'Interleukin-15/genetics', 'Interleukin-23', 'Interleukin-23 Subunit p19', 'Interleukins/genetics', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Monocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['73/6/3714 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.73.6.3714-3724.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2005 Jun;73(6):3714-24. doi: 10.1128/IAI.73.6.3714-3724.2005.,,,,,,PMC1111842,,,,,,,,

To provide a new source of hepatocytes in hepatocytes transplantation and liver tissue engineering, we investigated the differentiation and differentiation ratio of hepatocytes in the ES cells differentiating system in a certain length of time. METHODS: BALB/c ES cells from mice were cultured for differentiation in medium without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). During the period of differentiation of ES cells, dual immunofluorescence was performed to analyze the expression of hepatic proteins in cytoplasm such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin (ALB). The count of relative hepatocyte-like cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) and the hepatic differentiation ratio was obtained. RESULTS: The expression of AFP was first determined at day 7 and that of ALB at day 13. The expressions of AFP and ALB became stronger with the extention of the differentiation time. The hepatic differentiation ratio at day 13 and 21 was 5.5% and 10.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: ES cells could differentiate into hepatocytes, which should be a new source of hepatocytes in transplantation of hepatocytes and liver engineering.","['Pan, Yun-Long', 'Cai, Ji-Ye', 'Hu, An-Bin']","['Pan YL', 'Cai JY', 'Hu AB']","['Department of General Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. tpanyl@jnu.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int,Hepatobiliary & pancreatic diseases international : HBPD INT,101151457,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Animal', 'Probability', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['695 [pii]'],ppublish,Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. 2005 May;4(2):291-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that B cells from a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients express not only FcgammaRIIB, as normal B lymphocytes, but also the myeloid FcgammaRIIA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the signaling capacity of both FcgammaRII isoforms in B-CLL cells. We found that FcgammaRIIA expressed by leukemic cells failed to induce Ca(2+) mobilization or protein tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that the receptor is not functional. By contrast, FcgammaRIIB effectively diminished BCR-triggered ERK 1 phosphorylation, which indicates that it is able to transduce inhibitory signals in B-CLL cells. Moreover, we found that FcgammaRIIB homoaggregation in either B-CLL or non-malignant tonsillar B cells did not result in apoptosis as was reported for murine B splenocytes. Together, these results show that FcgammaRIIB, but not FcgammaRIIA is biologically active in B-CLL cells and might influence leukemic cell physiology in vivo.","['Gamberale, Romina', 'Fernandez-Calotti, Paula', 'Sanjurjo, Julieta', 'Arrossagaray, Guillermo', 'Avalos, Julio Sanchez', 'Geffner, Jorge', 'Giordano, Mirta']","['Gamberale R', 'Fernandez-Calotti P', 'Sanjurjo J', 'Arrossagaray G', 'Avalos JS', 'Geffner J', 'Giordano M']","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425 Buenos Aires, Argentina. rgamberale@hematologia.anm.edu.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc gamma receptor IIA)', '0 (Fc gamma receptor IIB)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00173-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Nov;29(11):1277-84. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.04.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Competitive RT-PCR was used to detect quantitatively the GPI-PLD mRNA in mononuclear cells. GPI-anchored CD55 and CD59 were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Complement-mediated lysis was assessed by staining method of trypan blue dye. RESULTS: The GPI-PLD activities and their mRNA copies in CML patients were significantly lower than those in healthy adults. At the tenth day after treatment with bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the GPI-PLD activities and copies of GPI-PLD mRNA almost recovered to the expression levels of healthy subjects. The expression of both CD55 and CD59 in CML patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. After treatment with insulin (10(-7) mol/l) plus glucose (16.7 mmol/l) for 48 h, the cellular GPI-PLD activity and mRNA levels in K562 cells derived from the leukemic cells of a CML patient all increased about 3-fold. Simultaneously, the GPI-anchored CD55 and CD59 on cell surfaces were released into the culturing medium, and the killing rate of complement-mediated K562 cell lysis increased almost 3 times. CONCLUSION: The decreased GPI-PLD expression may reduce the release of GPI-anchored CD55 and CD59 in leukemia cells and finally decrease complement mediated killing of these cells in chronic phase of CML.","['Jian-Hua, Tang', 'Xiao-Jie, Zhang', 'Yi-Dan, Wang', 'Wen-Kai, Li', 'Wang-Jiao, He', 'Cheng-Hong, Wang', 'Gui-Yuan, Li']","['Jian-Hua T', 'Xiao-Jie Z', 'Yi-Dan W', 'Wen-Kai L', 'Wang-Jiao H', 'Cheng-Hong W', 'Gui-Yuan L']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, Xiangya Road 88, Mail box 54number, Changsha, Hunan 410078, PR China. miket561@xysm.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD55 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD59 Antigens/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Complement System Proteins/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*pathology', 'Phospholipase D/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/05/24 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(05)00215-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cccn.2005.03.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2005 Sep;359(1-2):115-24. doi: 10.1016/j.cccn.2005.03.045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with malignancies enrolled in a double-blind randomized trial of caspofungin (50 mg/day after a 70 mg loading dose) vs. conventional amphotericin B (0.6-1.0 mg/kg/day) as treatment of documented invasive candidiasis. A favorable response required complete resolution of signs and symptoms plus eradication of the Candida pathogen(s). The primary efficacy analysis used a modified intention-to-treat (MITT) approach that included all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of invasive candidiasis who received > or =1 dose of study medication. RESULTS: 74/224 (33%) patients in the MITT population had active malignancies. 25/30 (83%) hematological malignancies were acute or chronic leukaemias. 22/44 (50%) solid tumors were related to the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with hematological malignancies tended to be younger (median [range] age: 49 [19-74] vs. 59 [19-81] years) and have higher baseline acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores (mean [range]: 17 [0-28] vs. 15 [5-35]) than patients with solid tumors. Neutropenia [< or =500/microl] was present on entry in 23 (77%) patients with hematological malignancies and in one (3%) patient with a solid tumor. Candidemia was demonstrated in 56 (88%) cancer patients. C. albicans was the single most frequent isolate in cancer patients, although the majority of cases were caused by non-albicans species. Cancer patients in the caspofungin arm had more hematological malignancies (55 vs. 29%), higher baseline APACHE II scores (>20 in 36 vs. 15%), more frequent neutropenia (42 vs. 24%), and less C. albicans infections (27 vs. 49%) than the amphotericin B-treated cancer patients. Favorable response rates were 11/18 (61%) and 6/12 (50%) for patients with hematological malignancies treated with caspofungin or amphotericin B, respectively; the corresponding outcomes in patients with solid tumors were 12/15 (80%) and 17/29 (59%) for the 2 treatment arms. 7/14 (50%) caspofungin- and 4/10 (40%) amphotericin B-treated patients who were neutropenic on entry responded favorably. All-cause mortality rates during the study for caspofungin recipients were 11/18 (61%) with hematological malignancies and 6/15 (40%) with solid tumors, and for amphotericin recipients were 4/12 (33%) with hematological malignancies and 6/29 (21%) with solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying cancers, most commonly leukaemias and gastrointestinal tumors, were present in one-third of patients enrolled in this study of invasive candidiasis. Overall, 70% of caspofungin-treated and 56% of amphotericin B-treated cancer patients responded favorably.

In an attempt to identify novel oocyte-specific genes in the mouse, we have used an in silico subtraction methodology, and we have focused our attention on genes that are organized in genomic clusters. RESULTS: In the present work, five clusters have been studied: a cluster of thirteen genes characterized by an F-box domain localized on chromosome 9, a cluster of six genes related to T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma protein 1 (Tcl1) on chromosome 12, a cluster composed of a SPErm-associated glutamate (E)-Rich (Speer) protein expressed in the oocyte in the vicinity of four unknown genes specifically expressed in the testis on chromosome 14, a cluster composed of the oocyte secreted protein-1 (Oosp-1) gene and two Oosp-related genes on chromosome 19, all three being characterized by a partial N-terminal zona pellucida-like domain, and another small cluster of two genes on chromosome 19 as well, composed of a TWIK-Related spinal cord K+ channel encoding-gene, and an unknown gene predicted in silico to be testis-specific. The specificity of expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization for eight and five of them, respectively. Finally, we showed by comparing all of the isolated and clustered oocyte-specific genes identified so far in the mouse genome, that the oocyte-specific clusters are significantly closer to telomeres than isolated oocyte-specific genes are. CONCLUSION: We have studied five clusters of genes specifically expressed in female, some of them being also expressed in male germ-cells. Moreover, contrarily to non-clustered oocyte-specific genes, those that are organized in clusters tend to map near chromosome ends, suggesting that this specific near-telomere position of oocyte-clusters in rodents could constitute an evolutionary advantage. Understanding the biological benefits of such an organization as well as the mechanisms leading to a specific oocyte expression in these clusters now requires further investigation.","['Paillisson, Amelie', 'Dade, Sebastien', 'Callebaut, Isabelle', 'Bontoux, Martine', 'Dalbies-Tran, Rozenn', 'Vaiman, Daniel', 'Monget, Philippe']","['Paillisson A', 'Dade S', 'Callebaut I', 'Bontoux M', 'Dalbies-Tran R', 'Vaiman D', 'Monget P']","['Physiologie de la Reproduction et des Comportements, UMR 6175 INRA-CNRS-Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours-Haras Nationaux, 37380 Nouzilly, France. apaillis@tours.inra.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Oosp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Genome', 'Genomics/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multigene Family', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",2005/05/24 09:00,2006/05/02 09:00,['2005/05/24 09:00'],"['2005/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-6-76 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-6-76 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2005 May 20;6:76. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-6-76.,,,20050520,,,PMC1166550,,,,,,,,

Despite the promising antineoplastic activities of TQ, the molecular mechanism of its pharmacologic effects is poorly understood. Here, we report that TQ exhibits antiproliferative effect, induces apoptosis, disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential and triggers the activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3 in myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells. The apoptosis induced by TQ was inhibited by a general caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK; a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, z-DEVD-FMK; as well as a caspase-8-specific inhibitor, z-IETD-FMK. Moreover, the caspase-8 inhibitor blocked the TQ-induced activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. In addition, TQ treatment of HL-60 cells caused a marked increase in Bax/Bcl2 ratios due to upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl2 proteins. These results indicate that TQ-induced apoptosis is associated with the activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3, with caspase-8 acting as an upstream activator. Activated caspase-8 initiates the release of cytochrome c during TQ-induced apoptosis. Overall, these results offer a potential mechanism for TQ-induced apoptosis in p53-null HL-60 cancer cells.","['El-Mahdy, Mohamed A', 'Zhu, Qianzheng', 'Wang, Qi-En', 'Wani, Gulzar', 'Wani, Altaf A']","['El-Mahdy MA', 'Zhu Q', 'Wang QE', 'Wani G', 'Wani AA']","['Department of Radiology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. wani.2@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency']",2005/05/21 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21205 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2005 Nov 10;117(3):409-17. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21205.,,"['R01 ES012991/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES12991/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES6074/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,

B-CLL, in this regard, represents an anomaly since there is not only high numbers of circulating B cells, characteristic of the malignancy, but also a massive expansion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. These T cells for the most part may probably not represent a leukaemia-specific TCR-dependent expansion. On the contrary, these T cells, especially the CD4 subset, might support a ""microenvironment"" sustaining the growth of the leukaemic B cell clone. Conversely, the leukaemic B cells may produce membrane-bound as well as soluble factors that stimulate the proliferation of these T cells in an antigen independent manner. In addition to these T cells lacking anti-leukaemic reactivity, there exist spontaneously occurring leukaemia-specific T cells recognizing several leukaemia-associated antigens, e.g. the tumour derived idiotype, survivin and telomerase. Both CD4 and CD8 leukaemia-specific T cells have been identified using proliferation and gamma-IFN assays. These reactive T cells can lyse autologous tumour cells in an MHC class I and II restricted manner. Spontaneously occurring leukaemia-specific T cells are more frequently noted at an indolent stage rather than in progressive disease. Preliminary results from vaccination trials using whole tumour cell preparations as vaccine have demonstrated that vaccination may induce a leukaemia-specific T cell response, which might be associated with clinical benefits. Extended clinical trials are required to establish the therapeutic effects of vaccination in B-CLL. Studies in our laboratory as well as those of others indicate that whole tumour cell antigen in the form of apoptotic bodies or RNA loaded on to dendritic cells may be a suitable vaccine candidate. Patients with low stage disease may maximally benefit from this form of therapy.","['Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Choudhury, Aniruddha']","['Mellstedt H', 'Choudhury A']","['Cancer Center Karolinska, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, 17176 Stockholm, Sweden. hakan.mellstedt@kus.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2005/05/21 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2004/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-005-0675-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Feb;55(2):210-20. doi: 10.1007/s00262-005-0675-4.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis of utilizing gene transfer via replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vectors for chronic protein delivery.

The production of IP10 from RCR-transduced cells could be maintained for at least three months in culture. The level and duration of IP10 expression in vivo was sufficient to inhibit growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors as well as metastatic lesions in mice. This tumor inhibition was correlated to a marked reduction in tumor vascularization and mitotic activity. By conducting immunohistological studies, we have been able to show that IP10 vector-affected tumors evidenced elevated levels of IL-12p35 mRNA, with no sign of changes in the local inflammatory response, however, as determined by macrophage infiltration and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.

The main objective of this study was to investigate whether different members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily could intervene in the first steps of embryo implantation by modulating the secretion of proimplantatory leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and in the tolerance of the fetal graft by regulating proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 secretion by human endometrial epithelium (EEC) in vitro. METHODS: EEC were isolated from biopsies collected from 16 informed and consenting fertile women and were cultured for 72 h. Cytokine measurements (LIF and IL-6) were realized by ELISA. RESULTS: TGF-beta(1) (from 10(-12) to 10(-8)M), -beta(2), -beta(3) and activin A (10(-10) and 10(-8)M) increased LIF secretion by EEC cultures. Inhibin B (10(-10) and 10(-8)M) did not stimulate LIF production by human EEC. Contrastingly, TGF-beta(1) (from 10(-12) to 10(-8)M), -beta(2), -beta(3) and activin A (10(-10) and 10(-8)M) reduced IL-6 release by the same cells. Activin A at 10(-8) M also significantly reduced the stimulating effect of IL-1beta (10(-9)M) which is known to stimulate LIF production by EEC. Only the highest concentration of inhibin B (10(-8)M) reduced IL-6 secretion by EEC, but did not modulate IL-1beta-induced stimulation of IL-6 secretion. CONCLUSION(S): Besides their role in the control of the process of implantation and in the induction of embryonic mesoderm, different members of the TGF-beta superfamily may also contribute in the reproductive process by enhancing endometrial proimplantatory LIF secretion and reducing proinflammatory IL-6 release by EEC.","[""Perrier d'Hauterive, Sophie"", 'Charlet-Renard, Chantal', 'Dubois, Michel', 'Berndt, Sarah', 'Goffin, Frederic', 'Foidart, Jean-Michel', 'Geenen, Vincent']","[""Perrier d'Hauterive S"", 'Charlet-Renard C', 'Dubois M', 'Berndt S', 'Goffin F', 'Foidart JM', 'Geenen V']","['University of Liege, Department of Medicine, Center of Immunology, Institute of Pathology CHU-B23, Liege-Sart Tilman, Belgium. sperrier@ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Neuroimmunomodulation,Neuroimmunomodulation,9422763,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (TGFB2 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta3)', '0 (activin A)', '0 (activin B)', '0 (inhibin B)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '93443-12-0 (Inhibin-beta Subunits)']",IM,"['Activins/immunology/pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Endometrium/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects/*immunology', 'Inhibin-beta Subunits/immunology/pharmacology', 'Inhibins/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta2', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta3']",2005/05/21 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2003/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['84848 [pii]', '10.1159/000084848 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroimmunomodulation. 2005;12(3):157-63. doi: 10.1159/000084848.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among eight French Adjuvant Study Group trials, 3653 patients were assessable: 2603 received epirubicin; 682 received hormonotherapy; and 368 had no systemic treatment. Chemotherapy was FEC regimen in 85% of cases (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50, 75 or 100 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, three or six cycles). Epirubicin cumulative dose was <300 mg/m2 in 1045 patients; 300-600 mg/m2 in 1187; and > or =600 mg/m2 in 286, followed by radiotherapy in 96% of cases. The median follow-up was 104 months. RESULTS: Eight cases of leukemia occurred in epirubicin-exposed patients and one in non-exposed patients. After 9 years, the risk of developing a leukemia was 0.34% (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.57) in epirubicin-exposed patients. In patients receiving chemotherapy, leukemia subtypes were: AML2 (two), AML3 (one), AML4 (three) and ALL (two). None of the classically recognized risk factors was significantly correlated with the occurrence of a leukemia. CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the dose, the incidence of secondary leukemia after adjuvant epirubicin-based chemotherapy was low. After a long follow-up, the benefit/risk ratio for early breast cancer patients remained in favor of epirubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy: eight cases (0.31%) occurred, and in some of them, treatment causality could be debatable.","['Campone, M', 'Roche, H', 'Kerbrat, P', 'Bonneterre, J', 'Romestaing, P', 'Fargeot, P', 'Namer, M', 'Monnier, A', 'Montcuquet, P', 'Goudier, M-J', 'Fumoleau, P']","['Campone M', 'Roche H', 'Kerbrat P', 'Bonneterre J', 'Romestaing P', 'Fargeot P', 'Namer M', 'Monnier A', 'Montcuquet P', 'Goudier MJ', 'Fumoleau P']",['m-campone@nantes.fnclcc.fr'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'FEC protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Epirubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/classification/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Survival Rate']",2005/05/21 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)54945-6 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdi251 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2005 Aug;16(8):1343-51. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdi251.

CLL cells express CXCR4 chemokine receptors that direct leukemia cell chemotaxis. Marrow stromal cells or nurselike cells constitutively secrete CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, thereby attracting and rescuing CLL B cells from apoptosis in a contact-dependent fashion. Therefore, the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis represents a potential therapeutic target in CLL. We evaluated the most active CXCR4-specific antagonists (T140, TC14012, TN14003) for their capacity to inhibit CXCL12 responses in CLL cells. T140, or its analogs, inhibited actin polymerization, chemotaxis, and migration of CLL cells beneath stromal cells. CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was abolished by CXCR4 antagonists. TC14012 and TN14003 antagonized the antiapoptotic effect of synthetic CXCL12 and stromal cell-mediated protection of CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that stromal cells protected CLL cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Treatment with CXCR4 antagonists resensitized CLL cells cultured with stromal cells to fludarabine-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that CXCR4 blocking agents effectively antagonize CXCL12-induced migratory and signaling responses and stromal protection of CLL cells from spontaneous or fludarabine-induced apoptosis. As such, small molecular CXCR4 antagonists may have activity in the treatment of patients with this disease.","['Burger, Meike', 'Hartmann, Tanja', 'Krome, Myriam', 'Rawluk, Justyna', 'Tamamura, Hirokazu', 'Fujii, Nobutaka', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Burger M', 'Hartmann T', 'Krome M', 'Rawluk J', 'Tamamura H', 'Fujii N', 'Kipps TJ', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Freiburg University Hospital, Hugstetterstr 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany. burger@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (TC14012)', '0 (TN14003)', 'DA9G065962 (T140 peptide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Actins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2005/05/21 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53093-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-12-4918 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 1;106(5):1824-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-12-4918.

Patients treated with MP alone achieved higher TGN concentrations than those treated with the combination of methotrexate plus mercaptopurine (MTX + MP). Analysis of the expression of approximately 9600 genes in ALL cells obtained at diagnosis identified 60 gene probes significantly associated with TGN accumulation in patients treated with MP alone and 75 gene probes in patients treated with MTX + MP, with no overlap between the 2 sets of genes. Genes significantly associated with intracellular TGN accumulation after MP alone included those encoding MP metabolic enzymes and transporters (eg, SLC29A1). Inhibition of SLC29A1 by nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR) caused a 33% to 45% reduction of TGN in ALL cells in vitro (P < .006), consistent with the gene expression findings. Genes associated with TGN concentration after combination therapy included those involved in protein and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-biosynthesis.

However, alteration of the components in the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI) has been elucidated. To define the precise role of the Wnt signaling components in CRC and leukemia cell lines with MSI, mutational analyses of the T cell factor 4 (TCF4) genes were performed. Here we describe for the first time a TCF4 MSI+ phenotype in leukemia cell lines except in colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, we found that these cell lines exhibited deletion and insertion of 1-2A in an (A)9 repeat so as to result in (A)7, (A)8, (A)10 and (A)11 repeat, respectively. To characterize the cellular function of these special TCF4 mutant clones, transient transfection and fluorescent microscopy were analyzed and the results revealed that the TCF4 frameshift gene products all localized in nuclei. Surprisingly, these TCF4 frameshift mutants lost transcriptional activity with beta-catenin and down-regulate the target gene expression.

In addition to its structural role, cholesterol is essential for proliferation and other cell processes. The present study was undertaken to explore the stringency of the requirement for cholesterol as a regulator of proliferation and cell cycle progression. Comparisons were made between cholesterol and other sterol analogs that differ from cholesterol in three specific elements: the presence of a Delta5 double bond in ring B, the hydroxyl group at C-3, and the presence of an aliphatic side chain. The human leukemia cells HL-60 and MOLT-4 were cultured in cholesterol-free medium and treated with different sterols in the presence or absence of SKF 104976, a competitive inhibitor of lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase that allows the synthesis of isoprenoid derivatives but not cholesterol. Our results show that the beta-hydroxyl group at C-3 and the unsaturated bond at Delta5 are necessary for cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. The sterol analog 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol (dihydrocholesterol), which is saturated at Delta5 and has an A/B ring junction in the trans configuration, was also able to support cell growth. However, 5beta-cholestan-3beta-ol and 5beta-cholestan-3alpha-ol, both of which have an A/B ring junction in the cis configuration, were totally ineffective in supporting cell growth. Indeed, they produced an inhibition of cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle specifically in the G2/M phase. These effects of 5beta-cholestanols were abrogated by cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, 5beta-cholestanols potently inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis and transcription driven by the sterol response element. In addition to providing a description of the structural features of sterols associated with their supporting action on cell proliferation in mammalian cells, the present results demonstrate that selected cholesterol analogs may act as cytostatic agents, interrupting cell cycle progression specifically in the G2/M phase.","['Suarez, Yajaira', 'Fernandez, Carlos', 'Ledo, Beatriz', 'Martin, Miguel', 'Gomez-Coronado, Diego', 'Lasuncion, Miguel A']","['Suarez Y', 'Fernandez C', 'Ledo B', 'Martin M', 'Gomez-Coronado D', 'Lasuncion MA']","['Servicio de Bioquimica-Investigacion, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Ctra. de Colmenar, km 9, E-28034 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,['97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure']",2005/05/21 09:00,2005/07/07 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2005/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1388-1981(05)00025-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 May 15;1734(2):203-13. doi: 10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.02.003.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of a large cohort of children with FN who had IVAMT discontinued with an ANC < or = 500/mm3 METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed of patients in the Northern Alberta Children's Cancer Program with FN and no apparent clinical source of fever from June 1, 1997 to July 1, 2002. RESULTS: Out of a total of 275 patients, 127 (46%) had at least one episode of FN, with FN occurring in patients with sarcomas more commonly than in those with leukemia/ lymphoma and least in those with other solid tumors. In 59 of 276 episodes of FN (21%) patients had a microbiologically defined infection at admission. Of the 217 remaining episodes, 112 of 199 patients (56%) with known neutrophil counts had IVAMT discontinued before their absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached 500/mm3 at the discretion of the clinician. Fever recurred in only two of these patients after discharge, and there were no bacterial infections diagnosed after parenteral antibiotics were discontinued. CONCLUSION: Even without use of standard criteria for early discharge, clinicians appear to be skilled at selecting children with FN who can safely have IVAMT discontinued with an ANC < or = 500/mm3.","['Hodgson-Viden, Heather', 'Grundy, Paul E', 'Robinson, Joan L']","['Hodgson-Viden H', 'Grundy PE', 'Robinson JL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. hhodgson@ualberta.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fever/drug therapy/etiology', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Length of Stay', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/blood/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Neutrophils', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/05/21 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/05/21 09:00'],"['2004/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2431-5-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2431-5-10 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2005 May 18;5(1):10. doi: 10.1186/1471-2431-5-10.,,,20050518,,,PMC1156908,,,,,,,,

It is frequently assumed that dependence between genes (or tests) is sufficiently weak to justify the proposed methods of testing for differentially expressed genes. A potential impact of between-gene correlations on the performance of such methods has yet to be explored. RESULTS: The paper presents a systematic study of correlation between the t-statistics associated with different genes. We report the effects of four different normalization methods using a large set of microarray data on childhood leukemia in addition to several sets of simulated data. Our findings help decipher the correlation structure of microarray data before and after the application of normalization procedures. CONCLUSION: A long-range correlation in microarray data manifests itself in thousands of genes that are heavily correlated with a given gene in terms of the associated t-statistics. By using normalization methods it is possible to significantly reduce correlation between the t-statistics computed for different genes. Normalization procedures affect both the true correlation, stemming from gene interactions, and the spurious correlation induced by random noise. When analyzing real world biological data sets, normalization procedures are unable to completely remove correlation between the test statistics. The long-range correlation structure also persists in normalized data.","['Qiu, Xing', 'Brooks, Andrew I', 'Klebanov, Lev', 'Yakovlev, Ndrei']","['Qiu X', 'Brooks AI', 'Klebanov L', 'Yakovlev N']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester, New York 14642, USA.

Although the process of clonal evolution of ATL cells may involve multiple steps, ATL cells from half of the ATL cases still retain the ability to express HTLV-I Tax, a key molecule of HTLV-I leukemogenesis. A recent finding of reactivation of Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in ATL patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation suggests the presence of Tax expression in vivo and potential contribution of the CTL to antitumor immunity. This is consistent with the results of a series of animal experiments indicating that Tax-specific CTL limit the growth of HTLV-I-infected cells in vivo, although the animal model mimics only an early phase of HTLV-I infection and leukemogenesis. Establishment of an insufficient HTLV-I-specific T-cell response and an increased viral load in orally HTLV-I-infected rats suggests that host HTLV-I-specific T-cell response at a primary HTLV-I infection can be a critical determinant of persistent HTLV-I levels thereafter.

The experimental system consists of three model target cell lines, derived from HeLa cells, that stably express one of three interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) chimeras, TAC, TAC-CD16, and TAC-DKQTLL, which have identical extracellular domains but different intracellular trafficking itineraries, and a targeted amphotropic murine leukemia retrovirus whose envelope proteins were modified to include a binding site for TAC at their N-termini. We found that the efficiency of retrovirus transduction was affected by the distribution and trafficking itinerary of the TAC receptors. Transduction of cells that expressed TAC-DKQTLL was nearly 4-fold lower than transduction of control cells that did not express any of the TAC receptors. In contrast, transduction of cells that expressed TAC was 1.6-fold higher than transduction of control cells, whereas transduction was not significantly affected by the expression of TAC-CD16.

Our study included 116 precursor B-cell (n = 104) and T-cell (n = 12) ALL patients treated with our protocol between 1988 and 1999. The patients were classified into 3 initial risk groups on the basis of conventional risk factors (56 in the low-risk, 33 in the high-risk, and 27 in the very high-risk groups). All patients received similar systemic chemotherapy regimens before the evaluation of their bone marrow on day 14. We evaluated the marrow of 69 patients as M1 (less than 5% blasts), 25 as M2 (5%-25% blasts), and 22 as M3 (more than 25% blasts). Although all patients attained an initial complete remission (CR), relapse was noted in 33 of the 116 patients, and 15 patients died. All of the M1 marrow patients, irrespective of the initial risk group, showed the best event-free survival rate (85.1% +/- 3 4.4%), the lowest relapse rate (14.5%), and the highest attainment of a second CR (100%); they were defined as the new R1 prognostic group.

They result from endothelial damage secondary to leukostasis. Leukapheresis, which aims to lower the white blood cell (WBC) count, has been used in certain patients to reduce the threat from leukostasis. However, there are very few published clinical investigations on the most appropriate use of leukapheresis in hyperleukocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 14 patients with hyperleukocytic leukaemia who presented to our institution and underwent therapeutic leukapheresis. We compare their clinical and biological characteristics and investigate the impact of leukapheresis on early mortality and long-term prognosis. RESULTS: The median presenting WBC count was 439 x 10(3)/mm(3). Although patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) had the lowest median presenting WBC counts, they constituted the largest group of patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis. Leukapheresis was highly effective, with the mean absolute and percentage reduction in WBC after each cycle being 126 x 10(3)/mm(3) and 31.9% respectively. Four patients with AML died within 2 weeks of presentation despite prompt and effective leukapheresis. CONCLUSION: The interaction between the leukaemic cells and the vascular environment, a mechanism that none of the current therapies directly address, is probably more important in causing leukostasis than the absolute cell count itself.","['Tan, D', 'Hwang, W', 'Goh, Y T']","['Tan D', 'Hwang W', 'Goh YT']","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital. dary1.tan@singhealth.com.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocytosis/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukostasis/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2005 Apr;34(3):229-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We surveyed the patients observed and operated at the National Institute of Neurosurgery, Budapest, Hungary. RESULTS: Space-occupying lesions of lacrimal gland fossa are: 1. Epithelial lacrimal gland tumours, which may be benign or malignant (benign pleomorphic adenoma, malignant pleomorphic adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, other carcinomas). 2. Lymphoproliferative tumours (lymphoma, leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, plasmocytoma). 3. Pseudotumours (chronic inflammation, granuloma, sarcoidosis, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia). 4. Other tumours (dermoid cyst, haemangioma, neurinoma, haemangiopericytoma, metastatic tumour). In our Institute, 42% of the tumours of the lacrimal fossa was epithelial, 50% was lymphoid or pseudotumour, and 8% other tumours. Of the 59 primary epithelial tumours 62.7% was benign and 37.3% was malignant. The differential diagnosis and management are based on the clinical presentations, imaging studies and histological examination. CONCLUSIONS: Pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal gland should be diagnosed on radiological and clinical evidence, and biopsy avoided to prevent the recurrences and malignant transformation. The prognosis of pleomorphic adenomas depends on the early diagnosis and radical surgical excision of the lesion. In cases of suspected malignant epithelial tumours, lymphomas and pseudotumours, biopsy is indicated for the choice of appropriate treatment.","['Hajda, Marta', 'Koranyi, Katalin', 'Salomvary, Bernadett', 'Bajcsay, Andras']","['Hajda M', 'Koranyi K', 'Salomvary B', 'Bajcsay A']","['Orszagos Idegsebeszeti Tudomanyos Intezet, Neuroophthalmologiai Osztaly, 1145 Budapest, Amerikai u. 57, Hungary.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Magy Onkol,Magyar onkologia,9313833,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Adenoma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Cystadenocarcinoma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eye Neoplasms/*diagnosis/surgery/*therapy', 'Granuloma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', '*Lacrimal Apparatus', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/therapy', 'Orbital Diseases/*diagnosis/surgery/*therapy', 'Orbital Pseudotumor/diagnosis/therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoidosis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/09/01 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['HUON.2005.49.1.0065 [doi]'],ppublish,Magy Onkol. 2005;49(1):65-70. doi: HUON.2005.49.1.0065.

CLL B cells express a restricted BCR repertoire including antibodies with quasi-identical complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), which suggests specific antigen recognition. The antigens recognized by CLL antibodies may include autoantigens since about half of CLL B cells produce autoreactive antibodies. However, the distribution of autoreactive antibodies between Ig heavy-chain variable-unmutated (IgV-unmutated) CLL (UM-CLL) and IgV-mutated CLL (M-CLL) is unknown. To determine the role of antibody reactivity and the impact of somatic hypermutation (SHM) on CLL antibody specificity, we cloned and expressed in vitro recombinant antibodies from M- and UM-CLL B cells and tested their reactivity by ELISA. We found that UM-CLL B cells expressed highly polyreactive antibodies whereas most M-CLL B cells did not. When mutated nonautoreactive CLL antibody sequences were reverted in vitro to their germline counterparts, they encoded polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies. We concluded that both UM-CLLs and M-CLLs originate from self-reactive B cell precursors and that SHM plays an important role in the development of the disease by altering original BCR autoreactivity.","['Herve, Maxime', 'Xu, Kai', 'Ng, Yen-Shing', 'Wardemann, Hedda', 'Albesiano, Emilia', 'Messmer, Bradley T', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Meffre, Eric']","['Herve M', 'Xu K', 'Ng YS', 'Wardemann H', 'Albesiano E', 'Messmer BT', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Meffre E']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Immunology, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies/genetics', '*B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/genetics']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/08/12 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI24387 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Jun;115(6):1636-43. doi: 10.1172/JCI24387.

One reason for the poor outcome in ANKL is leukemic infiltration into multiple organs. The mechanisms of cell trafficking associated with the chemokine system have been investigated in NK cells. To clarify the mechanism of systemic migration of leukemic NK cells, we enrolled nine ANKL and six CNKL cases, and analyzed the expression profiles and functions of chemokine receptors by flowcytometry and chemotaxis assay. CXCR1 was detected on NK cells in all groups, and CCR5 was positive in all ANKL cells. Proliferating NK cells were simultaneously positive for CXCR1 and CCR5 in all ANKL patients examined, and NK cells with this phenotype did not expand in CNKL patients or healthy donors. ANKL cells showed enhanced chemotaxis toward the ligands of these receptors. These results indicated that the chemokine system might play an important role in the pathophysiology of ANKL and that chemokine receptor profiling might be a novel tool for discriminating ANKL cells from benign NK cells.","['Makishima, H', 'Ito, T', 'Asano, N', 'Nakazawa, H', 'Shimodaira, S', 'Kamijo, Y', 'Nakazawa, Y', 'Suzuki, T', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Kiyosawa, K', 'Ishida, F']","['Makishima H', 'Ito T', 'Asano N', 'Nakazawa H', 'Shimodaira S', 'Kamijo Y', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Suzuki T', 'Kobayashi H', 'Kiyosawa K', 'Ishida F']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Chemokines/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, CCR5/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A/genetics/physiology']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/08/25 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403732 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403732 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jul;19(7):1169-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403732.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effect of desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator with 'hypoxia-mimetic' activity, on the differentiation of AML cells. The results showed that DFO at nontoxic concentrations induced the differentiation of AML cell lines NB4 and U937, as assessed by morphological criteria and differentiation-associated antigens. DFO-induced differentiation parallel to the rapid accumulation of HIF-1 alpha protein in these two cell lines. Of importance, the transient transfection of HIF-1 alpha cDNA induced U937 cells to develop the differentiation-related alterations such as growth arrest and increased CD11b expression. Furthermore, the inducible expression of chromosome translocation t(8;21)-generated leukemogenic AML1-ETO fusion gene attenuated DFO-induced differentiation of U937 cells with the decrease of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), a critical factor for granulocytic differentiation. Using immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay, HIF-1 alpha was also shown to interact physically with and to increase the transcriptional activity of C/EBP alpha.

In imatinib-sensitive cells, combination index (CI) values obtained using the method of Chou and Talalay indicated additive (CI=1) or marginally antagonistic (CI>1) effects following simultaneous treatment with imatinib and 17-AAG. In imatinib-resistant cells both drugs acted synergistically (CI<1). In primary chronic-phase CML cells additive or synergistic effects of the combination of imatinib plus 17-AAG were discernible. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining showed that the activity of imatinib plus 17-AAG is mediated by apoptosis. Combination treatment with imatinib plus 17-AAG was more effective in reducing the BCR-ABL protein level than 17-AAG alone. Monotherapy with 17-AAG decreased P-glycoprotein activity, which may increase intracellular imatinib levels and contribute to the sensitization of CML cells to imatinib.

Using the French American British classification, the M3 form of the disease or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been found to be sensitive in vitro and in vivo to the retinoid all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The mechanism for this is by restoration of normal gene expression through the release of histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). In contrast to APL, other forms of AML are either nonresponsive or show blunted responses to ATRA. We evaluated if the inhibitor of HDAC activity, valproic acid (VPA), could mimic or enhance retinoid sensitivity in the AML cell line, OCI/AML-2, and clinical samples derived from patients with AML. An Affymetrix GeneChip experiment demonstrated that VPA modulated the expression of numerous genes in OCI/AML-2 cells that were not affected by ATRA including p21, a retinoid responsive gene in APL. VPA induced p21 expression in OCI/AML-2 cells and the majority of the AML samples tested; this was associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis not seen with ATRA alone. The addition of ATRA to VPA accentuated many of these responses, supporting the potential beneficial combination of these drugs in the treatment of AML.","['Trus, M R', 'Yang, L', 'Suarez Saiz, F', 'Bordeleau, L', 'Jurisica, I', 'Minden, M D']","['Trus MR', 'Yang L', 'Suarez Saiz F', 'Bordeleau L', 'Jurisica I', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, Princess Margaret Hospital/Ontario Cancer Institute University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/08/25 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403773 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403773 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jul;19(7):1161-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403773.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the protein expression of chromosome 12 candidate genes was characterized by comparing CLL cases with (n=58) or without (n=16) trisomy 12, CD19+-B-cells and cell lines (JVM-2, EHEB, JURKAT). Immunoblotting was performed to quantify the levels of AID, APAF-1, ARF3, CCND2, CDK2, CKD4, GLI, MDM-2, p27, Smac/DIABLO and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6). The cell lines showed distinct expression patterns for CCND2, MDM-2, p27, Smac/DIABLO and STAT6, and displayed higher levels of CDK2 and CDK4 than the CLL cases. JURKAT and the CLL cases expressed uniformly high levels of p27, but low levels of CCND2. AID expression in the CLL cases was weak with slight variations regardless of the subgroup affiliation. The expression of the investigated proteins was independent of the trisomy 12 status as well as of the VH mutation status. The comparison of CD19+-B-cells with CLL revealed higher protein levels in CLL for CDK4, p27, Smac/DIABLO and STAT6. Further studies including protein expression experiments in genetic high-risk subgroups of CLL have to elucidate whether these proteins qualify as candidates for targeted CLL therapies.","['Winkler, D', 'Schneider, C', 'Krober, A', 'Pasqualucci, L', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S']","['Winkler D', 'Schneider C', 'Krober A', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Universitat Ulm, Innere Medizin III, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/*genetics']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/08/25 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403778 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403778 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jul;19(7):1211-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403778.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, this antiapoptotic protein is upregulated by interleukin-6, which plays a critical role in multiple myeloma (MM). For these reasons, we have evaluated the expression of Mcl-1 in vivo in normal, reactive and malignant plasma cells (PC), that is, myeloma cells from 51 patients with MM and 21 human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) using flow cytometry. We show that Mcl-1 is overexpressed in MM in comparison with normal bone marrow PC. In total, 52% of patients with MM at diagnosis (P=0.017) and 81% at relapse (P=0.014 for comparison with diagnosis) overexpress Mcl-1. Of note, only HMCL but not reactive plasmacytoses have abnormal Mcl-1 expression, although both PC expansions share similar high proliferation rates. Of interest, Bcl-2 as opposed to Mcl-1, does not discriminate malignant from normal PC. Finally, the level of Mcl-1 expression is related to disease severity, the highest values at diagnosis being associated with the shortest event-free survival (P=0.002). In conclusion, Mcl-1, which has been shown to be essential for the survival of human myeloma cells in vitro, is overexpressed in vivo in MM in relation with relapse and shorter survival.

Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus occurred in 2/20 informative patients (only in t-FL samples). p53 staining was positive in 82% (9/11) of available biopsies with a missense mutation, and negative in 71% (45/63) with wtTP53. MDM2 expression was significantly higher in t-FL samples (mean 72% positive; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 68-76%) than FL (mean 58% positive; 95% CI 54-62%) (P<0.001) but did not correlate with TP53 status. TP53 mutation has only a limited role in the transformation of FL, exerting a heterogeneous influence upon phenotypic change. In contrast, dysregulation of MDM2 is frequent and may provide a more rational therapeutic target..","['Davies, A J', 'Lee, A M', 'Taylor, C', 'Clear, A J', 'Goff, L K', 'Iqbal, S', 'Cuthbert-Heavens, D', 'Calaminici, M', 'Norton, A J', 'Lister, T A', 'Fitzgibbon, J']","['Davies AJ', 'Lee AM', 'Taylor C', 'Clear AJ', 'Goff LK', 'Iqbal S', 'Cuthbert-Heavens D', 'Calaminici M', 'Norton AJ', 'Lister TA', 'Fitzgibbon J']","[""Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, Bart's and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.

We examined whether mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway could be the genetic events that cause acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) harboring t(8;21). Mutations in the second tyrosine kinase domain, juxtamembrane (JM) domain and exon 8 of the C-KIT gene were observed in 10, one and three of 37 AML patients with t(8;21), respectively. Three patients showed an internal tandem duplication in the JM domain of the FLT3 gene. One patient had a mutation in the K-Ras gene at codon 12. As the occurrence of these mutations was mutually exclusive, a total of 18 (49%) patients showed mutations in the RTK pathway. These results suggest that activating mutations in the RTK pathway play a role in part as an additional event leading to the development of t(8;21) AML. The 6-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with RTK pathway mutations was 79.8%, compared with 13.5% in patients lacking such mutations (P=0.0029). Furthermore, the 6-year relapse-free survival in patients with mutations was 18% compared to 60% in those without mutations (P=0.0340), indicating that RTK mutations are associated with the clinical outcome in t(8;21) AML.","['Nanri, T', 'Matsuno, N', 'Kawakita, T', 'Suzushima, H', 'Kawano, F', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Asou, N']","['Nanri T', 'Matsuno N', 'Kawakita T', 'Suzushima H', 'Kawano F', 'Mitsuya H', 'Asou N']","['Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/09/10 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403803 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403803 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Aug;19(8):1361-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403803.,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia (2005) 19, 1361-1366.']",,,,,

The FHIT methylation was found in 13 of 94 (13.8%) AML and 22 of 40 (55.0%) MDS cases, but not in normal mononuclear cells (MNCs). Both the frequency and density of methylation increased in the advanced-stages MDS and the relapsed AML cases. Although FHIT and p15(INK4B) methylations were not correlated in MDS and AML, increased FHIT methylation at the relapse in AML was associated with p15(INK4B) methylation. The median expression level in AML was significantly higher than in normal MNCs, although the median expression level in those with methylation was significantly lower than in those without methylation. Furthermore, the methylation level at relapse was significantly higher than at diagnosis in AML.

Controls were 104 AML with normal karyotype. In subgroups with trisomy, the median expression of genes located on gained chromosomes was higher, while in AML with monosomy 7 and deletion 5q the median expression of genes located in deleted regions was lower. The 50 most differentially expressed genes, as compared to all other subtypes, were equally distributed over the genome in AML subgroups with trisomies. In contrast, 30 and 86% of the most differentially expressed genes characteristic for AML with 5q deletion and monosomy 7 are located on chromosomes 5 or 7. In conclusion, gain of whole chromosomes leads to overexpression of genes located on the respective chromosomes. Losses of larger regions of the genome translate into lower expression of the majority of genes represented by only one allele. The reduced expression of these genes is the most characteristic difference in gene expression profiles between AML with monosomy 7 and AML with deletion 5q, respectively, and other AML subtypes. Therefore, these data provide evidence that gene dosage effects gene expression in AML with unbalanced karyotype abnormalities. Losses of specific regions of the genome determine the gene expression profile more strongly than the gain of whole chromosomes.","['Schoch, C', 'Kohlmann, A', 'Dugas, M', 'Kern, W', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Schnittger, S', 'Haferlach, T']","['Schoch C', 'Kohlmann A', 'Dugas M', 'Kern W', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. claudia.schoch@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Monosomy/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Trisomy']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/08/25 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403810 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403810 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jul;19(7):1224-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our experience of 25 cases in 5 years.,1051-5,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the extent of methotrexate (MTX)-related pancytopenia at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) between 1999 and 2004. METHODS: Patients were identified by a department database search, review of pharmacy records and personal communication. Pancytopenia was defined as white blood cell count (WBC) <3.5 x 10(9)/l, haemoglobin (Hb) <11 g/dl and platelet count <130 x 10(9)/l. Severe pancytopenia was defined as WBC <2.0 x 10(9)/l, Hb <10 g/dl and platelet count <50 x 10(9)/l. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients had MTX-induced pancytopenia. Eleven patients were taking folic acid and one folinic acid. The median dose of MTX was 12.5 mg weekly (interquartile range 5.625 mg) and median duration of treatment 36 months (interquartile range 40.5 months). The severity of pancytopenia correlated with the dose (P = 0.04). The numbers of patients with potential risk factors were: renal insufficiency, 8; pre-existing folate deficiency, 7; age >75 yr, 15; hypoalbuminaemia, 18; pre-existing infection with hip prosthesis, 1; possible drug interactions, 18; dosing errors, 1; and polypharmacy, 15. Pancytopenia was detected by routine blood monitoring in nine patients. There were seven deaths (28% mortality), five from sepsis and two from acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: This is the largest reported individual case series of MTX-induced pancytopenia. With the increasing long-term use of MTX, it is important that patients be monitored for haematological side-effects as pancytopenia can be a late manifestation. Pharmacogenetics may hold the answer to predicting who is at risk of this potentially fatal complication of MTX.","['Lim, A Y N', 'Gaffney, K', 'Scott, D G I']","['Lim AY', 'Gaffney K', 'Scott DG']","['Rheumatology Department, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich NR4 7UY, UK. anitalim@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/*chemically induced', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['keh685 [pii]', '10.1093/rheumatology/keh685 [doi]']",ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2005 Aug;44(8):1051-5. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/keh685.

More than 90% of leukemic cells in acute lymphocytic leukemia and approximately 30% of leukemic cells in the chronic myelogenous leukemia crisis show elevated TDT activity. This finding is connected to a poor prognosis and response to chemotherapy and reduced survival time. On the other hand, recent data indicated that TDT is not the only terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase in mammalian cells. Its close relative, DNA polymerase lambda, can synthesize DNA both in a template-dependent (polymerase) and template-independent (terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase) fashion. DNA polymerase lambda might be involved in the nonhomologous end-joining recombinational repair pathway of DNA double-strand breaks. In this work, we report the characterization of the mechanism of action of three diketo hexenoic acid (DKHA) derivatives, which proved to be extremely selective for the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activity of DNA polymerase lambda and TDT. They seem to be the first non-nucleoside-specific inhibitors of mammalian terminal transferases reported. Moreover, the DKHA analog 6-(1-phenylmethyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2,4-dioxo-5-hexenoic acid (RDS2119) was not toxic toward HeLa cells (CC(50) > 100 muM), whereas it showed significant cytotoxicity against the TDT(+) leukemia cell line MOLT-4 (CC(50) = 14.9 muM), thus having the potential to be further developed as a novel antitumor agent.","['Locatelli, Giada A', 'Di Santo, Roberto', 'Crespan, Emmanuele', 'Costi, Roberta', 'Roux, Alessandra', 'Hubscher, Ulrich', 'Shevelev, Igor', 'Blanca, Giuseppina', 'Villani, Giuseppe', 'Spadari, Silvio', 'Maga, Giovanni']","['Locatelli GA', 'Di Santo R', 'Crespan E', 'Costi R', 'Roux A', 'Hubscher U', 'Shevelev I', 'Blanca G', 'Villani G', 'Spadari S', 'Maga G']","['Istituto di Genetica Molecolare IGM-CNR, via Abbiategrasso 207, 27100 Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hexuronic Acids)', '0 (hexenuronic acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hexuronic Acids/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/08/24 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.105.013326 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.105.013326 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2005 Aug;68(2):538-50. doi: 10.1124/mol.105.013326.

Its three subfamilies have distinct roles: The BH3-only proteins trigger apoptosis by binding via their BH3 domain to prosurvival relatives, while the proapoptotic Bax and Bak have an essential downstream role involving permeabilization of organellar membranes and induction of caspase activation. We have investigated the regulation of Bak and find that, in healthy cells, Bak associates with Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) but surprisingly not Bcl-2, Bcl-w, or A1. These interactions require the Bak BH3 domain, which is also necessary for Bak dimerization and killing activity. When cytotoxic signals activate BH3-only proteins that can engage both Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) (such as Noxa plus Bad), Bak is displaced and induces cell death. Accordingly, the BH3-only protein Noxa could bind to Mcl-1, displace Bak, and promote Mcl-1 degradation, but Bak-mediated cell death also required neutralization of Bcl-x(L) by other BH3-only proteins. The results indicate that Bak is held in check solely by Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) and induces apoptosis only if freed from both. The finding that different prosurvival proteins have selective roles has notable implications for the design of anti-cancer drugs that target the Bcl-2 family.","['Willis, Simon N', 'Chen, Lin', 'Dewson, Grant', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Naik, Edwina', 'Fletcher, Jamie I', 'Adams, Jerry M', 'Huang, David C S']","['Willis SN', 'Chen L', 'Dewson G', 'Wei A', 'Naik E', 'Fletcher JI', 'Adams JM', 'Huang DC']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*physiology/radiation effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['gad.1304105 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1304105 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2005 Jun 1;19(11):1294-305. doi: 10.1101/gad.1304105.

SUMMARY: Bevacizumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the biological activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein involved in the neovascularization of multiple malignant tumors. A single dose of bevacizumab 0.1-10 mg/kg yields a maximum concentration of 2.8-284 microg/mL and shows a dose-response relationship. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that bevacizumab has both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects, resulting in a reduction in tumor growth and increases in median survival time and time to tumor progression. Bevacizumab is available as an intravenous agent and carries FDA-approved labeling for use in the first-line treatment of meta-static colorectal cancer in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg is infused intravenously over 30-90 minutes every two weeks. No dosage reductions are required for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Bevacizumab has also yielded preliminary evidence of efficacy for breast, non-small-cell lung, pancreatic, prostate, renal, and hepatic cancers, as well as for melanoma and acute myelogenous leukemia. The most frequent adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, headache, epistaxis, anorexia, stomatitis, dyspnea, and constipation. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy has become the standard of care for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and may prove useful for other tumors as well.","['Motl, Susannah']",['Motl S'],"['College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee, 875 Monroe Avenue, Suite 112, Memphis, TN 38163, USA. smotl@utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bevacizumab', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/05/20 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['62/10/1021 [pii]', '10.1093/ajhp/62.10.1021 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2005 May 15;62(10):1021-32. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/62.10.1021.,60,,,['Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2005 May 15;62(10):1017.

The audit shows chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukaemia to be the most common underlying conditions in which splenic irradiation is used. Painful splenomegaly and hypersplenism were the most common indications. Dose fractionation schedules vary widely across the UK, and also the level of full blood counts used to interrupt radiotherapy.

To elucidate causes of apoptotic defects, we studied the protein expression of Apaf-1, procaspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -10, and poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 43) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 10).

PARP expression was a median 7-fold lower in T-lineage ALL (P < .001) and 10-fold lower in AML (P < .001) compared with B-lineage ALL. PARP expression was 4-fold lower in prednisolone, vincristine and L-asparaginase (PVA)-resistant compared with PVA-sensitive ALL patients (P < .001).

Drug resistance further limits the therapy. Here, we investigated selective killing of drug-resistant cancer cells by antagonistic drug combinations, which can spare (because of drug antagonism) normal cells. We used paired cell lines that are resistant to Adriamycin due to either expression of MRP1 or lack of G2 checkpoints. The goal was to selectively kill Adriamycin-resistant cancer cells with Docetaxel (Taxotere), while protecting parental (Adriamycin-sensitive) cells, using cytostatic concentrations of Adriamycin. Taxotere kills cells in mitosis. Therefore, by arresting parental cells in G2, 20 to 40 ng/mL of Adriamycin prevented cell death caused by Taxotere. Also, Adriamycin prevented the effects of Taxotere in normal human lymphocytes. In contrast, Taxotere selectively killed MRP1-expressing leukemia cells, which did not undergo G2 arrest in the presence of Adriamycin. Also, in the presence of Adriamycin, HCT116-p21-/- cancer cells with a defective G2 checkpoint entered mitosis and were selectively killed by Taxotere. Finally, 20 ng/mL of Adriamycin protected normal FDC-P1 hematopoietic cells from Taxotere. Whereas parental cells were protected by Adriamycin, the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor PD90598 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of Taxotere selectively in Raf-1-transformed FDC-P1 leukemia cells. We propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent normal cells from entering mitosis while increasing apoptosis selectively in mitotic cancer cells.","['Demidenko, Zoya N', 'Halicka, Dorota', 'Kunicki, Jan', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew', 'Blagosklonny, Mikhail V']","['Demidenko ZN', 'Halicka D', 'Kunicki J', 'McCubrey JA', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Blagosklonny MV']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Docetaxel', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*physiology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2005/05/19 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/05/19 09:00'],"['2005/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/10/4401 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4428 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 May 15;65(10):4401-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4428.,,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA098195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its use has a strong pharmacologic rationale: to overcome mechanisms of resistance of the malignant cells and to achieve cytotoxic concentrations in sanctuary sites for lymphoblasts. Although therapeutic progress in ALL during the past 4 decades has been closely associated with more widespread use of intravenous methotrexate and in progressively larger doses, little data exist to clearly support the use of high-dose intravenous methotrexate over a regimen of prolonged administration of low-dose methotrexate. The implied superiority of intravenous methotrexate mainly stems from studies that used identical leucovorin rescue with low-dose methotrexate or from studies of upfront window therapy in untreated children with ALL in which single standard doses of oral methotrexate were compared with high-dose intravenous methotrexate with leucovorin rescue. The evidence favoring administration of intravenous methotrexate for children with ALL is critically reviewed. Despite its extensive use, high-dose intravenous methotrexate has not been proved conclusively to be more effective than less toxic, less labor intensive, and less costly methods of methotrexate administration.","['Mantadakis, Elpis', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Kamen, Barton A']","['Mantadakis E', 'Cole PD', 'Kamen BA']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2005/05/19 09:00,2005/09/03 09:00,['2005/05/19 09:00'],"['2005/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.25.5.748.63584 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2005 May;25(5):748-55. doi: 10.1592/phco.25.5.748.63584.,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such destructive lesions to myocytes greatly hinder the capacity of the cardiac muscle to hypertrophy to meet the needs of bodily growth, pregnancy and certain intense sports activities. Endothelial cells also accelerate an early arteriosclerotic process, a potential cause of sudden death in the case of ostial stenosis. All such phenomena build up over time, together with the usual adult cardio-vascular risk factors. Finally, no cardiac tissue, pericardial, valvular endocardium or autonomic nervous tissue escapes these cytotoxic effects, giving rise to pericarditis, calcification, valvular leaks and arrythmias and conduction abnormalities. The resulting excessive cardiac mortality is one of the major concerns of paediatric oncologists, along with secondary tumours and leukaemia. This article analyses physiopathological consequences that are often asymptomatic or clinical, together with diagnostic, screening and follow-up methods for these patients, encouraging lifestyle modifications where appropriate or, when possible, treatment before the appearance of cardiac failure, myocardial infarction or sudden death. Other cytotoxic drugs such as high-dose cyclophosphamide, amsacrin, 5-FU and tubulin acting agents are also mentioned as a result of their cardiac toxicity, but this is not usually dose-cumulative.","['Pein, Francois', 'Iserin, Laurence', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Lemerle, Jean']","['Pein F', 'Iserin L', 'de Vathaire F', 'Lemerle J']","[""Departement d'Oncologie de l'Enfant et l'Adolescent, Institut Gustave-Roussy, 39, rue Camille-Desmoulins, 94805 Villejuif. pein@igr.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Heart/*radiation effects', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*complications', 'Survivors']",2005/05/19 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/05/19 09:00'],"['2005/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2004 Nov;91 Suppl 3:185-91.,44,,,,,,,,,"Toxicite cardiaque des traitements du cancer chez l'enfant et l'adolescent: physiopathologie, donnees cliniques et point de vue de l'oncopediatre.",,,,

Dihydropyridine-sensitive, L-type Ca2+ channels appear to play a significant role in Ca2+ mobilization during T cell activation, but very little is known about the molecular structure of these channels in T lymphocytes. Here we identify two novel splice variants of the Ca(V)1.4 (alpha1F) L-type Ca2+ channel that are expressed in human T lymphocytes, and also demonstrate expression of the Ca(V)1.4 protein in the human Jurkat T cell leukemia line and human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTs). The carboxy-termini of both Ca(V)1.4 splice isoforms contain unique exon usages distinct from the Ca(V)1.4 channel isolated from human retina that may render these channel variants insensitive to changes in membrane depolarization. Additional evidence of the importance of these new splice variants comes from the demonstration that the mRNA expression of the Ca(V)1.4 splice isoforms is regulated by TCR-induced activation in Jurkat T cells, and to a lesser extent in human PBTs. Overall these results provide the first evidence that structurally unique L-type Ca2+ channels exist in T lymphocytes, which can contribute to a Ca2+ influx during T lymphocyte activation.","['Kotturi, Maya F', 'Jefferies, Wilfred A']","['Kotturi MF', 'Jefferies WA']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, Michael Smith Laboratory and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (CACNA1F protein, human)', '0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type/genetics/*metabolism', '*Calcium Signaling', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retina/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'TRPM Cation Channels']",2005/05/19 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/05/19 09:00'],"['2004/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(05)00025-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2005.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2005 Aug;42(12):1461-74. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2005.01.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) with unnatural carbohydrates as cell-surface tags were harvested by treatment with N-levulinoylmannosamine (ManLev). The attachment of ManLev-treated HL-60 cells to 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymers with hydrazide groups was studied. HL-60 cells, which are nonadhesive, did not attach to any polymer surface without ManLev treatment. In contrast, ManLev-treated HL-60 cells attached to a poly[MPC-co-n-butyl methacrylate (BMA)-co-methacryloyl hydrazide (MH)] (PMBH) surface following 15 min of incubation. The cells that attached to the PMBH surface retained their native morphology and viability for 24 h of incubation. On the other hand, approximately half of the HL-60 cells that attached to the poly(BMA-co-MH) (PBH) surface died. These results suggest that MH units in the polymer act as anchors for cell attachment and MPC units help to preserve cell viability on a polymer surface. The coculture of ManLev-treated HL-60 and fluorescence-stained human uterine cervical cancer cells (HeLa) was carried out on polymer surfaces. ManLev-treated HL-60 cells specifically attached to the PMBH surface. In contrast, both HL-60 and HeLa cells were observed on the PBH surface.

MYO1F consists of at least 28 exons and was predicted to encode a 1098-amino-acid with an N-terminal head domain containing both ATP-binding and actin-binding sequences, a neck domain with a single IQ motif, and a tail with TH1, TH2 and SH3 domains. Northern blot analysis of RNAs prepared from multiple tissues showed that the expression of approximately 4-kb transcripts appeared constant in most tissues examined. However, MYO1F was expressed in only three of 22 leukemic cell lines. The MLL-MYO1F fusion protein contains almost the entire MYO1F, however, C-terminal MYO1F has neither the transactivation domain nor the dimerization domain found in various MLL fusion partners. Further analysis of this novel type of MLL fusion protein would provide new insights into leukemogenesis. MYO1F is the fourth partner gene of MLL on 19p13. At the cytogenetic level, it may be difficult to distinguish MLL-ENL, MLL-ELL, MLL-EEN and MLL-MYO1F fusions created by t(11;19)(q23;p13), and it is likely that cases of t(11;19) lacking a known fusion gene may result in this gene fusion.","['Taki, Tomohiko', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Saito, Shinobu', 'Ono, Ryoichi', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Kato, Yoko', 'Yuza, Yuki', 'Eto, Yoshikatsu', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Taki T', 'Akiyama M', 'Saito S', 'Ono R', 'Taniwaki M', 'Kato Y', 'Yuza Y', 'Eto Y', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, 465 Kajii-cho Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Myosin Type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Myosin Type I/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208711 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208711 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Aug 4;24(33):5191-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208711.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we employed oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the expression profiles of the K3P and Sil leukemic cell lines originating from patients with HOX11+ T-ALL to that of Jurkat cells, which originated from a distinct subtype of T-ALL (TAL1+). To distinguish potential HOX11 target genes from those characteristic of the stage of HOX11 leukemic arrest, we also performed gene expression analysis on Jurkat cells, genetically engineered to express exogenous HOX11. The resulting HOX11 gene expression signature, which was validated for representative signaling pathways by transient transfection of reporter constructs, was characterized by elevated expression of transcriptional programs involved in cell proliferation, including those regulated by E2F, c-Myc and cAMP response element-binding protein. We subsequently showed that ectopic HOX11 expression resulted in hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which correlated with inhibition of the major Rb serine/threonine phosphatase PP1. HOX11 also inhibited PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase activity concomitant with stimulation of the AKT/PKB signaling cascade. These results suggest that transcriptional deregulation of G1/S growth-control genes, mediated in large part through blockade of PP1/PP2A phosphatase activity, plays an important role in HOX11 pathobiology.","['Riz, Irene', 'Hawley, Robert G']","['Riz I', 'Hawley RG']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'G1 Phase/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'S Phase/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208727 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208727 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Aug 25;24(36):5561-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208727.,,"['R01HL65519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24RR16209/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066305-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 RR016209/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL66305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2408753,,['NIHMS51737'],,,,,,

Two distinct alternative forms, Evi-1a and Evi-1c, are generated from the EVI-1 gene. Whereas Evi-1a is widely recognized as an oncoprotein, a role for Evi-1c, which has an additional PR domain in the amino-terminus of Evi-1a, in leukemogenesis, has not been elucidated thus far. Aberrant oligomerization of transcription factors has recently emerged as a prevalent mechanism for activating their oncogenic potential in hematopoietic malignancies. Here, to study the mechanisms that underlie Evi-1-mediated oncogenesis, we investigated formation of oligomeric complexes by the Evi-1 proteins. We show that Evi-1a forms homo-oligomers, whereas Evi-1c exclusively exists as a monomer in mammalian cells. Remarkably, Evi-1c has lost the ability to interact with CtBP, a transcriptional corepressor that associates with Evi-1a. As a consequence, the ability of Evi-1c to repress transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling is significantly abrogated. These results identify a novel function of a PR domain to regulate oligomerization of transcription factors and suggest that homo-oligomerization may play a critical role in corepressor recruitment by the Evi-1 proteins. In addition, we found that the chimeric oncoprotein acute myelocytic leukemia (AML)1-Evi-1, generated in t(3;21) leukemia, also forms homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with Evi-1a, while it did not interact with Evi-1c. Consistent with the results, repression of TGF-beta by AML1-Evi-1 was significantly enhanced by Evi-1a, whereas it was hardly affected by the presence of Evi-1c. These results suggest that oligomerization may contribute to the oncogenic potential of Evi-1-containing proteins.","['Nitta, Eriko', 'Izutsu, Koji', 'Yamaguchi, Yuko', 'Imai, Yoichi', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Hirai, Hisamaru']","['Nitta E', 'Izutsu K', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Imai Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Chiba S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/10/15 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208754 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208754 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Sep 8;24(40):6165-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Problems with reduced efficacy were addressed by combining the anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 on the same single-chain molecule. DT2219 had greater anticancer activity than monomeric or bivalent immunotoxins made with anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 sFv alone and it showed a higher level of binding to patient leukemia cells and to CD19(+)CD22(+) Daudi or Raji cells than did anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 parental monoclonal antibodies. The resulting DT2219, mutated to enhance its avidity, was cytotoxic to Daudi cells in vitro (IC(50) = 0.3 nmol/L). In vivo, DT2219 was effective in a flank tumor therapy model in which it significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < 0.05) and in a systemic model in which it significantly prolonged survival of severe combined immunodeficient mice with established Daudi (P < 0.008) compared with controls.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In one phase 3 controlled trial, 191 study subjects were randomized to treatment with azacitidine or to observation; an additional 120 patients were treated with azacitidine in two phase 2 single arm studies. The primary efficacy end point was the overall response rate, defined as complete or partial normalization of peripheral blood counts and bone marrow blast percentages for at least 4 weeks. RESULTS: In the controlled trial, the overall response rate was 15.7% in the azacitidine treatment group; there were no responders in the observation group (P < 0.0001). Response rates were similar in the two single arm studies. During response patients stopped being red cell or platelet transfusion dependent. Median duration of responses was at least 9 months. An additional 19% of azacitidine-treated patients had less than partial responses, most becoming transfusion independent. The most common adverse events attributed to azacitidine were gastrointestinal, hematologic, local (injection site), and constitutional. There were no azacitidine-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: On May 19, 2004 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved azacitidine as injectable suspension for treatment of patients with the following myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

Epigenetic deregulation affects several aspects of tumor cell biology, including cell growth, cell cycle control, differentiation, DNA repair, and cell death. This raises the strong possibility that reversing deregulated epigenetic mechanisms may be an effective treatment strategy for leukemia and cancer.

FGFR3 acts as an oncogene to promote multiple myeloma cell proliferation and antiapoptosis. These encourage the clinical development of FGFR3-specific inhibitors. Three short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting different sites of FGFR3 were selected and subsequently transfected into KMS-11, OPM-2, and NCI-H929 human myeloma cell lines, all of which are characterized by t(4;14) and FGFR3 over expression. The combination of these three shRNAs can effectively inhibit FGFR3 expression in all three cell lines. Sequential immunocytochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridization was employed to validate that the shRNAs specifically inhibited FGFR3 expression in OPM-2 cells. Decreased expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) proteins and increased staining of Annexin V-positive cells showed that inhibition of FGFR3 induces apoptosis. After confirming down-regulation of FGFR3 by real-time PCR, HU-133 plus 2.0 array was employed to compare the gene expression profile of shRNA-treated sample with that of the control. Besides the down-regulation of FGFR3, expression of the antiapoptotic genes CFLAR, BCL2, MCL1, and some members of NF-kappaB family decreased, whereas expression of the proapoptotic genes CYC, BID, CASP2, and CASP6 increased. Microarray results also revealed changes in genes previously implicated in multiple myeloma pathogenesis (RAS, RAF, IL-6R, and VEGF), as well as others (TLR4, KLF4, and GADD45A) not previously linked to multiple myeloma. Our observations indicate that shRNAs can specifically and effectively inhibit FGFR3 expression. This targeted approach may be worth testing in multiple myeloma patients with t(4;14) and FGFR3 overexpression in the future.","['Zhu, Lijun', 'Somlo, George', 'Zhou, Bingsen', 'Shao, Jimin', 'Bedell, Victoria', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Liu, Xiyong', 'Luo, Jianhong', 'Yen, Yun']","['Zhu L', 'Somlo G', 'Zhou B', 'Shao J', 'Bedell V', 'Slovak ML', 'Liu X', 'Luo J', 'Yen Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutic Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/5/787 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0330 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 May;4(5):787-98. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the lysosomal protease cathepsin D has been implicated in apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, inhibition of protein kinase C, and stimulation of the TNFR1 and Fas death receptors. However, the role of cathepsin D in chemotherapy-induced cell death has remained largely unexplored. In this report, we show that treatment of U937 leukemia cells with the chemotherapy drug etoposide (VP-16) results in cathepsin D release into the cytosol within 4 hours after initiation of drug treatment. VP-16-induced cathepsin D release was not inhibited by z-VAD-FMK or pepstatin A, suggesting that it occurred independently of the activities of caspase proteases or cathepsin D. Down-regulation of cathepsin D expression in suspension U937 cells or adherent HeLa cells using cathepsin D small interfering RNA partially inhibited cell death resulting from treatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand, or the chemotherapy drugs VP-16, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Moreover, cathepsin D down-regulation significantly delayed cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in response to chemotherapy treatment. Incubation of isolated mitochondria with cathepsin D-treated cytosolic extracts resulted in potent release of cytochrome c, indicating that a cytoplasmic substrate mediates the effects of cathepsin D on mitochondria. Together, these findings show that cathepsin D plays an important role in chemotherapy-induced cell death, and that cathepsin D lies upstream of cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in the chemotherapy-induced execution pathway.","['Emert-Sedlak, Lori', 'Shangary, Sanjeev', 'Rabinovitz, Asaf', 'Miranda, Michelle B', 'Delach, Scott M', 'Johnson, Daniel E']","['Emert-Sedlak L', 'Shangary S', 'Rabinovitz A', 'Miranda MB', 'Delach SM', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center Research Pavilion, Room 2.18c, 5117 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582, USA. johnsond@pitt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cathepsin D/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/5/733 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0301 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 May;4(5):733-42. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0301.,,['R01 CA86980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the standard thiopurine drug regimen is associated with increased hematopoetic toxicity in patients with low or absent TPMT activity, whereas patients with high activity may be insufficiently treated. However, presently available methods are labour intensive and time consuming and tend towards too high or too low enzyme activity due to their methodological approach. The use of instable substrate solutions (6-MP or 6-TG), organic solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide and too high substrate and co-substrate saturation concentrations contribute to this phenomenon. We therefore, established an optimized and fast isocratic HPLC linked TPMT assay based on the enzymatic methylation of mercaptopurine or thioguanine in RBC lysates with S-adenosyl-l-methionine as methyl donor. Unspecific non-enzymatic methylation was not detectable. The recovery of 6-methyl-mercaptopurine was 97-102%, the intra- and interday variation between 1.0 and 5.0%, respectively. The assay dispenses with a time consuming extraction procedure with organic solvents, a heating step, and a gradient elution and is therefore, favourable for clinical routine application. The TPMT activity was measured in 62 untreated children with acute lymphoblastic leucemia at the time of diagnosis (activity = 34.0+/-10.6 nmol/g Hb/h, range: 11.5-55.4 nmol/g Hb/h) and in 12 adult healthy volunteers (62.8+/-7.7 nmol/g Hb/h, range: 48-82 nmol/g Hb/h) reflecting the wide measurable TPMT activity found in erythrocytes.","['Khalil, Maurice N', 'Erb, Norbert', 'Khalil, Philipe N', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E']","['Khalil MN', 'Erb N', 'Khalil PN', 'Escherich G', 'Janka-Schaub GE']","['Clinic of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

Among the enzymes of the cycle, nuclear phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) has been analyzed quite extensively. In this context, PI-PLCbeta1 appears to play a key role as a check point in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It has also been shown that its activation and/or up-regulation is upon the control of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-R) in both mouse fibroblast and myoblasts, suggesting that its signaling activity is essential for the normal behavior of the cell, at least in culture. The recent discovery of a possible involvement of the deletion of PI-PLCbeta1 gene in the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in humans strengthens the contention that nuclear PI-PLC signaling is essential for physiological processes such as cell growth and differentiation. Even though PI-PLCbeta1 is present and does not translocate to eukaryotic nuclei, this organelle, even though only in some conditions contains also PI-PLCgamma1 which acts not only as a PI-PLC but also as guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for PI 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) and is somehow linked to PI 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Also members of PI-PLCdelta family are shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and return and are possibly involved in the control of cell growth. We must also take into account the presence in the nucleus of other phospholipases such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipase D (PLD), which also exert a signaling activity upon external stimuli. On the whole this review highlights the latest development in the PI-PLC cycle in the nucleus, which in terms of activation, regulation and down-stream targets differs substantially from that located at the plasma membrane.","['Manzoli, Lucia', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Faenza, Irene', 'Fiume, Roberta', 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Manzoli L', 'Martelli AM', 'Billi AM', 'Faenza I', 'Fiume R', 'Cocco L']","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Prog Lipid Res,Progress in lipid research,7900832,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Muscle Cells/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",2005/05/18 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-7827(05)00014-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.plipres.2005.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Lipid Res. 2005 Jul;44(4):185-206. doi: 10.1016/j.plipres.2005.04.003.

Most prior work in analyzing gene expression data, however, focuses on predictive performance but not so much on deriving human understandable knowledge. This paper presents a systematic approach for learning and extracting rule-based knowledge from gene expression data. A class of predictive self-organizing networks known as Adaptive Resonance Associative Map (ARAM) is used for modelling gene expression data, whose learned knowledge can be transformed into a set of symbolic IF-THEN rules for interpretation. For dimensionality reduction, we illustrate how the system can work with a variety of feature selection methods. Benchmark experiments conducted on two gene expression data sets from acute leukemia and colon tumor patients show that the proposed system consistently produces predictive performance comparable, if not superior, to all previously published results. More importantly, very simple rules can be discovered that have extremely high diagnostic power. The proposed methodology, consisting of dimensionality reduction, predictive modelling, and rule extraction, provides a promising approach to gene expression analysis and disease understanding.","['Tan, Ah-Hwee', 'Pan, Hong']","['Tan AH', 'Pan H']","['School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore. asahtan@ntu.edu.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neural Netw,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,8805018,,IM,"['Animals', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Entropy', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Statistics as Topic/*methods']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2004/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0893-6080(05)00023-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neunet.2005.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Neural Netw. 2005 Apr;18(3):297-306. doi: 10.1016/j.neunet.2005.01.003.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) still represents today a major complication of hematopoietic SCT. Two types of GVHD have traditionally been recognized on the basis of the time of onset following transplantation, distinct pathobiological pathways, and different clinical presentations. The acute form commonly breaks out 2 to 6 weeks after transplantation, affecting up to 60% of patients receiving allogeneic transplants from HLA identical donors. Transfer of immunocompetent donor T cells contained in the graft may undergo alloreactivity against recipient cells because of major or minor histocompatibility antigens disparities between the donor and the immunosuppressed host. Target specificity in acute GVHD involves preferential injury to epithelial surfaces of the skin and mucous membranes, biliary ducts of the liver, and crypts of the intestinal tract. Chronic GVHD affects approximately 30% to 80% of patients surviving 6 months or longer after stem cell transplantation and is the leading cause of nonrelapse deaths occurring more than 2 years after transplantation. Chronic GVHD is a multiorgan syndrome with clinical features suggesting some autoimmune diseases, and possibly both alloreactive and autoreactive T cell clones are involved in its pathophysiology. Although GVHD may convey beneficial graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma effects, it also entails a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Patients with mild GVHD need only minimal, if any, immunosuppressive treatment, whereas prognosis of patients with extensive disease or resistant to standard immunosuppressive treatment may be dismal. Early recognition of GVHD followed by prompt therapeutic intervention may prevent the progression to higher-grade disease and improve the outcome for patients receiving hematopoietic SCT.","['Vargas-Diez, Erich', 'Garcia-Diez, Amaro', 'Marin, Alicia', 'Fernandez-Herrera, Jesus']","['Vargas-Diez E', 'Garcia-Diez A', 'Marin A', 'Fernandez-Herrera J']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain. erichvargas@aedv.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Dermatol,Clinics in dermatology,8406412,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chronic Disease', 'Critical Illness', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Skin Diseases/*immunology/physiopathology']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0738-081X(04)00103-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clindermatol.2004.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Dermatol. 2005 May-Jun;23(3):285-300. doi: 10.1016/j.clindermatol.2004.06.005.,177,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When treated with 5 microM MCS-C2, inhibited proliferation associated with apoptotic induction was found in the HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner, plus nuclear DAPI staining revealed the typical nuclear features of apoptosis. However, MCS-C2 showed almost no antiproliferative effect and no apoptotic induction in normal lymphocyte cells used as a control when compared with those in HL-60 cancer cells. Moreover, a flow cytometric analysis of the HL-60 cells using FITC-dUTP and propidium iodide (PI) showed that the apoptotic cell population increased gradually from <1% at 0 h to 34% at 12 h after exposure to 5 microM MCS-C2. This apoptotic induction was associated with the cleavage of Bid and a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, followed by the activation of caspase-3 and inactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). However, there was no significant change in any other mitochondrial membrane proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bax. Consequently, the current findings suggest that the mitochondrial pathway was primarily involved in the MCS-C2-induced apoptosis in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.","['Kim, Min Kyoung', 'Cho, Youl-Hee', 'Kim, Jung Mogg', 'Chun, Moon Woo', 'Lee, Seung Ki', 'Lim, Yoongho', 'Lee, Chul-Hoon']","['Kim MK', 'Cho YH', 'Kim JM', 'Chun MW', 'Lee SK', 'Lim Y', 'Lee CH']","['Department of Medical Genetics and Institute of Biomedical Science, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul 133-791, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (MCS-C2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L7995C4D7F (Toyocamycin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mitochondria', 'Toyocamycin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2004/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00854-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.10.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2005 Jun 8;223(2):239-47. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.10.045.

Recently, various PKC modulators were used as a chemotherapeutic agent of leukemia. Decursin (1), a pyranocoumarin from Angelica gigas, exhibits the cytotoxic effects on various human cancer cell lines and in vitro PKC activation. For the development of more effective anticancer agents with PKC modulation activity, 11 decursin derivatives 2-12 were chemically synthesized and evaluated for their ability to act as a tumor-suppressing PKC activator and as an antagonist to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a tumor-promoting PKC activator. In the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS), all of 12 compounds 1-12 activated PKC (mainly alpha, beta, and gamma isozymes) but only three compounds 1-3 activated PKC even in the absence of PS. Six compounds 1-6 containing the coumarin structure were cytotoxic to human K562 erythroleukemia and U937 myeloleukemia cells. A cytotoxic mechanism of decursin and its derivatives was investigated using TUR cells, a PKC betaII-deficient variant of U937 cells. Among six compounds 1-6 with cytotoxicity to K562 and U937 leukemia cells, only three compounds 1-3 were cytotoxic to TUR cells. Therefore, compounds 1-3 and 4-6 inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells in a PKC betaII-independent and dependent manner, respectively, indicating that the side chain of compounds determines the dependency of their cytotoxicity on PKC betaII. To further elucidate the cytotoxic mechanism of compounds 1 and 2, levels of PKC isozymes and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated. Compounds 1-2 induced the down-regulation of PKC alpha and betaII in K562 cells and the production of ROS in U937 cells. Thus, PKC and ROS are probably important factors in the cytotoxic mechanism of compounds 1-2. From these results, the structure-activity relationship of decursin and its derivatives is as follows: (i) the coumarin structure is required for anti-leukemic activity and (ii) the side chain is a determinant of PKC activation and the cytotoxic mechanism in leukemia cells.","['Kim, Hyeon Ho', 'Sik Bang, Sung', 'Seok Choi, Jin', 'Han, Hogyu', 'Kim, Ik-Hwan']","['Kim HH', 'Sik Bang S', 'Seok Choi J', 'Han H', 'Kim IH']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'E95RTO3YQR (decursin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Angelica/chemistry', 'Benzopyrans/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2004/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2004/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00836-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.10.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2005 Jun 8;223(2):191-201. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.10.025.

Cells were accumulated in G0/1 after serum deprivation. However, when cells were treated with 5 microM dicoumarol in serum-free medium, a significant increment in the number of cells in S-phase was observed. Inhibition of G0/1 blockade was confirmed by the increase of thymidine incorporation, the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, and the promotion of cell growth in long-term treatments in the absence of serum. Dicoumarol treatment increased superoxide levels, but did not affect peroxide. Increase of cellular superoxide was essential for inhibition of G0/1 blockade, since scavenging this reactive species with a cell-permeable form of SOD and the SOD mimetics 2-amino-3,5-dibromo-N-[trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl]benzylamine (ambroxol, 100 microM) and copper[II]diisopropyl salicylate (CuDIPS, 10 microM) completely abolished the effect of dicoumarol. However, N-acetyl-cysteine, overexpression of Bcl-2 or a cell-permeable form of catalase were not effective. 5-Methoxy-1,2-dimethyl-3-[(4-nitrophenol)methyl]-indole-4,7-dione (ES936), a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), did not promote S phase entry, and dicoumarol still inhibited G0/1 blockade in the presence of ES936. We demonstrate that dicoumarol inhibits the normal blockade in G0/1 in HL-60 cells through a mechanism involving superoxide, but this effect is not dependent solely on the inhibition of the NQO1 catalytic activity. Our results send a precautionary message about use of dicoumarol to elucidate cellular processes involving oxidoreductases.","['Bello, Rosario I', 'Gomez-Diaz, Consuelo', 'Lopez-Lluch, Guillermo', 'Forthoffer, Nathalie', 'Cordoba-Pedregosa, Maria C', 'Navas, Placido', 'Villalba, Jose M']","['Bello RI', 'Gomez-Diaz C', 'Lopez-Lluch G', 'Forthoffer N', 'Cordoba-Pedregosa MC', 'Navas P', 'Villalba JM']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular, Fisiologia e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Dicumarol/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects/physiology', 'Superoxides/*pharmacology']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2004/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00190-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.03.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Jun 1;69(11):1613-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.03.012.

Among the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) involved in ATRA metabolism, the ATRA-inducible cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26A1) is particularly active although the molecular mechanisms involved in its regulation are not well defined in the target leukemia cells. To study CYP26A1 expression and regulation in APL cells, we used the NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line. CYP26A1 constitutive expression was barely detectable in NB4 cells, but ATRA could induce high levels of CYP26A1 expression, which reached a maximum at 72h. To further define CYP26A1 induction mechanisms in the NB4 leukemia cells, we used RARs and RXR selective agonists. The RARalpha agonist BMS753 could elicit maturation, as expected, but not CYP26A1 expression. Treatment with the RARbeta agonist BMS641, or the RARbeta/gamma agonist BMS961, could not elicit maturation, as expected, nor induce CYP26A1 expression. Because CYP26A1 expression could not be induced by RAR ligands alone, NB4 cells were then co-treated with the RXR agonist BMS649. The RXR agonist alone could not induce CYP26A1 expression, nor in combination with either the RARbeta agonist or the RARbeta/gamma agonist. However, the combination of the RXR agonist and the RARalpha agonist could elicit a marked induction of CYP26A1 expression. In conclusion, we have shown that CYP26A1 induction is not essential for the granulocytic maturation of NB4 leukemia cells, and that CYP26A1 induction requires the activation of both RARalpha and RXR in these cells.","['Idres, Nadia', 'Marill, Julie', 'Chabot, Guy G']","['Idres N', 'Marill J', 'Chabot GG']","[""Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Chimique et Genetique (Inserm U640-CNRS UMR8151), Universite Paris 5, Rene Descartes, Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, 4 Avenue de l'Observatoire, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*agonists/physiology']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2004/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00154-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.02.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Jun 1;69(11):1595-601. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.02.024.

In this study, we examined the differences in the mechanisms of the growth inhibitory effect of the combination of imatinib and R115777 (Zarnestra) among BCR/ABL-positive cell lines. Steel and Peckham isobologram analysis indicated that this combination had a strong synergistic inhibitory effect on growth in all imatinib-resistant cell lines and their parental cell lines. Levels of cleaved caspase 3 were increased by the combination treatment in all cell lines. However, both the level of cleaved PARP and the number of annexin-V-positive cells were much less increased in KCL22 and KCL22/SR cells than in K562, KU812, K562/SR and KU812/SR cells. The combination treatment promoted p27(KIP1) accumulation and induced a significant increase in the percentage of G0/G1 KCL22 and KCL22/SR cells. In other cell lines, the percentage of G0/G1 cells was not increased but rather decreased. The results indicate that induction of apoptosis and blockage of the cell cycle were major mechanisms of the synergistic inhibitory effect of the combination treatment, but the relative importance of these mechanisms differed among cell types.

We assessed individual contributions of signaling by IL-8 receptors by transfection of CXCR1 and CXCR2 into rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and human monocytic THP-1 cells. CXCR1 expressing cells migrated on the fibronectin ligands for alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrins in response to IL-8, whereas CXCR2 expressing cells did not. RBL cells expressing the chimeric CXCR1 receptor containing the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR2 had greatly blunted migration, while cells expressing the CXCR2 chimera with the tail of CXCR1 had augmented migration. Last, inhibitors of p38 and JNK MAP kinases blocked IL-8-induced migration in CXCR1+ cells.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A cost-utility (Markov) model within the setting of the UK NHS and viewed from a health system perspective was adopted. Transition probabilities and relative risks were estimated from published literature. Costs of drug treatment, outpatient care, bone marrow biopsies, radiography, blood transfusions and inpatient care were obtained from the British National Formulary and local hospital databases. Costs (pound, year 2001-03 values) were discounted at 6%. Quality-of-life (QOL) data were obtained from the published literature and discounted at 1.5%. The main outcome measure was cost per QALY gained. Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses were performed along with probabilistic (stochastic) analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of imatinib, compared with IFNalpha, was pound26,180 per QALY gained (one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from pound19,449 to pound51,870) and compared with hydroxycarbamide was pound86,934 per QALY (one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from pound69,701 to pound147,095) [ pound1=$US1.691=euro1.535 as at 31 December 2002].Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 50% of the ICERs for imatinib, compared with IFNalpha, fell below a threshold of approximately pound31,000 per QALY gained. Fifty percent of ICERs for imatinib, compared with hydroxycarbamide, fell below approximately pound95,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests, given its underlying data and assumptions, that imatinib may be moderately cost effective when compared with IFNalpha but considerably less cost effective when compared with hydroxycarbamide. There are, however, many uncertainties due to the lack of long-term data.","['Dalziel, Kim', 'Round, Ali', 'Garside, Ruth', 'Stein, Ken']","['Dalziel K', 'Round A', 'Garside R', 'Stein K']","['Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, Peninsula Medical School, Exeter, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Markov Chains', 'Models, Economic', 'Piperazines/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/*therapeutic use']",2005/05/18 09:00,2005/08/13 09:00,['2005/05/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['23510 [pii]', '10.2165/00019053-200523050-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2005;23(5):515-26. doi: 10.2165/00019053-200523050-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now identified four novel hGRalpha transcripts that have various deletions of exon 2 sequences. Among these hGRalpha splice variants, three of them, 1A1/E2dist hGRalpha, 1A2/E2prox hGRalpha, and 1A3/E3 hGRalpha, arise from the hGR 1A promoter, while 1B/E3 hGRalpha comes from the hGR 1B promoter. When fused to Flag and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tags at the carboxy terminus, all transcript variants can be correctly translated in vitro and in vivo. The Flag-tagged hGRalpha protein variants can functionally bind to a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and can mediate hormonal stimulation of a pGRE-luciferase reporter gene. Compared to the ""classical"", native hGRalpha, these four variants exhibit a cell type-specific activation of a reporter gene, and this is influenced by the hGRalpha 3' untranslated region in the hGR transcript. When equal amounts of the cDNAs for these GRalpha variant proteins are transfected into cells, they can exhibit lower or higher transcriptional activation compared to the classical GR. Furthermore, the EGFP-tagged proteins are nuclear localized, even in the absence of hormone. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR, we found that these transcripts exist at a low level in CEM-C7 cells and IM-9 cells, although the concentrations of the 1A3/E3 hGRalpha and 1B/E3 hGRalpha transcripts are higher than for hGRbeta transcripts, while 1A1/E2dist hGRalphaand 1A2/E2prox hGRalpha transcript levels are comparable to the 1A1 hGRalpha and 1A2 hGRalpha (without the exon 2 deletions) transcript levels, respectively. Because these novel hGR, N-terminal deleted, protein variants have altered biological activity, their expression could potentially affect the hormone sensitivity or resistance in leukemia and be useful in diagnosing hormone-sensitive or -resistant disease.","['Geng, Chuan-dong', 'Pedersen, Kim Brint', 'Nunez, B Scott', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Geng CD', 'Pedersen KB', 'Nunez BS', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Stanley S.

The efficacy of cell-based immunotherapy can be analyzed by determination of cytotoxic activity of T cells toward tumor cells in vitro. This study supplies a flow cytometric method to analyze T-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity toward heterogeneous leukemic cell populations at a single-cell level. METHODS: The fluorescent probe SYTO16 and the dead-cell dye 7-aminoactinomycine-D (7-AAD) were used to identify early and late stages of apoptosis in combination with leukemia cell-identifying markers. Determination of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells was performed by inclusion of fluorescent beads. RESULTS: In nine acute myeloid leukemia samples and three leukemic cell lines the use of SYTO16 next to the dead-cell marker 7-AAD significantly increased (P = 0.001) the sensitivity of the cytotoxicity assay as compared with single use of 7-AAD. Analysis of several effector-to-target ratios revealed the ability to determine dose-response effects. Enumeration of absolute numbers resulted in coefficients of variation of 4.1% and 8.4% for cell lines and leukemic samples, respectively.

METHODS: Twenty older patients with recurrent or refractory AML or MDS were treated in a Phase II protocol with sequential VPA and ATRA therapy. VPA was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day and then escalated to achieve the serum concentration of 45-100 microg/mL. ATRA was added at 45 mg/square meters (sm) per day when VPA reached the target serum concentration. Only patients treated continuously for > or = 2 months were considered evaluable. RESULTS: Hematologic improvement, according to World Health Organization criteria, was observed in 6 of 20 patients enrolled in the protocol but in 6 of 11 considered evaluable. In five patients, a major platelet response was observed, achieving platelet transfusion independence. Three of these five patients also exhibited a minor erythroid response. A sixth patient showed both a minor erythroid response and a platelet response. The median duration of response was 189 days (range, 63-550 days). No significant reduction in the blast count was observed. Grade 3 neurocortical toxicity was observed in four patients. Severe bone pain was experienced by 4 patients (2 Grade 4 and 2 Grade 3) and was associated with an increase in the peripheral blast cell count. Treatment with ATRA did not modify the response observed with VPA alone. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation therapy with VPA was of clinical benefit in approximately 30% of elderly patients with AML and MDS of the refractory anemia with excess of blast type with unfavorable prognostic features. A striking platelet transfusion independence lasting several months may be obtained in some patients, reducing the burden of palliative care and improving the quality of life.","['Pilatrino, Chiara', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Messa, Emanuela', 'Morotti, Alessandro', 'Giugliano, Emilia', 'Pautasso, Marisa', 'Familiari, Ubaldo', 'Cappia, Susanna', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Guerrasio, Angelo']","['Pilatrino C', 'Cilloni D', 'Messa E', 'Morotti A', 'Giugliano E', 'Pautasso M', 'Familiari U', 'Cappia S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G', 'Guerrasio A']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. chiarapila@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy', '*Platelet Count', 'Risk', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Valproic Acid/*therapeutic use']",2005/05/17 09:00,2005/08/23 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21132 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jul 1;104(1):101-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a single channel study of endogenously expressed Mg(2+)-dependent cation channels in the human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Inwardly directed unitary currents were activated in cell-attached experiments in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the pipette solution. The current-voltage (I-V) relationships displayed strong inward rectification and yielded a single channel slope conductance of approximately 30 pS at negative potentials. The I-V relationships were not altered by patch excision into divalent-free solution. Channel open probability (P(o)) and mean closed time constant (tau(C)) were strongly voltage-dependent, indicating that gating mechanisms may underlie current inward rectification. Millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ or Mg2+ applied to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane produced slow irreversible inhibition of channel activity. The Mg(2+)-dependent cation channels described in this study differ from the MIC channels described in human T-cells, Jurkat, and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells in their I-V relationships, kinetic parameters and dependence on intracellular divalent cations. Our results suggested that endogenously expressed Mg(2+)-dependent cation channels in K562 cells and the MIC channels in other hematopoietic cells might be formed by different channel proteins.","['Semenova, Svetlana B', 'Fomina, Alla F', 'Vassilieva, Irina O', 'Negulyaev, Yuri A']","['Semenova SB', 'Fomina AF', 'Vassilieva IO', 'Negulyaev YA']","['Institute of Cytology RAS, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., St. Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV6 protein, human)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/genetics', 'Cations/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Magnesium/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TRPV Cation Channels/genetics']",2005/05/17 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20410 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 Dec;205(3):372-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20410.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,

These mutations lead to production of a variant GATA1 protein (GATA1s) that is truncated at its N terminus. To understand the biological properties of GATA1s and its relation to DS-AMKL and TMD, we used gene targeting to generate Gata1 alleles that express GATA1s in mice. We show that the dominant action of GATA1s leads to hyperproliferation of a unique, previously unrecognized yolk sac and fetal liver progenitor, which we propose accounts for the transient nature of TMD and the restriction of DS-AMKL to infants.

However, most of these findings were based on data from families ascertained for genetic studies. Fecundity bias, right censoring bias, and secular trends can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence of anticipation. Our report investigates anticipation in four lymphoproliferative cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL, and multiple myeloma, drawn from Swedish and Danish population-based registries. We used marginal survival methods to test for a relative difference in age at diagnosis between parents and offspring and to account for other risk factors, staggered entries, censored data, and correlations among relatives. Changes in incidence rates of lymphoproliferative tumors were accommodated in the models by using time-varying covariates for different periods of diagnosis. Whereas no anticipation was observed for Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL, and multiple myeloma, our initial model, which controlled for gender and country, suggested a significant difference (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.75) in age at diagnosis between the parents and offspring in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma sample. However, once we accounted for the significant change in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence over time, the statistical difference between parents and offspring disappeared (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.76). Our results emphasize the importance of considering secular trends when evaluating the possibility of anticipation in lymphoproliferative cancers.

This study was designed to gain insights into molecular networks underlying the clinical synergy between retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which results in a high-quality disease-free survival in most patients after consolidation with conventional chemotherapy. We have applied an approach integrating cDNA microarray, 2D gel electrophoresis with MS, and methods of computational biology to study the effects on APL cell line NB4 treated with RA, ATO, and the combination of the two agents and collected in a time series. Numerous features were revealed that indicated the coordinated regulation of molecular networks from various aspects of granulocytic differentiation and apoptosis at the transcriptome and proteome levels. These features include an array of transcription factors and cofactors, activation of calcium signaling, stimulation of the IFN pathway, activation of the proteasome system, degradation of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein, restoration of the nuclear body, cell-cycle arrest, and gain of apoptotic potential.

Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide staining in human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells showed the ability of LCY-2-CHO to increase cell population in sub-G1 stage with time- and concentration-dependent manners. LCY-2-CHO-mediated cell death was also demonstrated by DNA laddering and was not related to the release of lactate dehydrogenase. Apoptosis in THP-1 cells induced by LCY-2-CHO was accompanied by the Bid cleavage, collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3. The apoptotic effect of LCY-2-CHO was diminished by the presence of zVEID-fmk (caspase-6 inhibitor), zIETD-fmk (caspase-8 inhibitor), and zVAD-fmk (non-selective caspase inhibitor), but was not altered by several antioxidants, and cathepsin inhibitor. The Bid cleavage and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, but not the cytochrome c release, were reversed by zIETD-fmk. Comparing the cell selectivity of LCY-2-CHO, we found T-cell acute lymphoblastic CEM leukemia cells were sensitive to 1 microM LCY-2-CHO, acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis at 10 microM, while adherent cancer cells, such as PC3, HT29 and MCF-7, were resistant to 30 microM LCY-2-CHO within 24-h incubation. Taken together in the present study, we demonstrated LCY-2-CHO might be apoptotic for malignant hematopoietic cells but not anchorage-dependent cells.

In this paper, a direct effect of catechin and EGCG on the performance of reverse transcription (RT) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was studied. Both tea polyphenolic compounds were added into real-time RT-PCR reactions and the fluorescence data obtained were fitted with a mathematical model. Several parameters of PCR performance were compared, obtained from the mathematical model for reactions with and without addition of (+)-catechin and EGCG. Addition of EGCG to enzyme reaction seems to inhibit the RT reaction (p < 0.05) and to slow down the DNA polymerase reaction (p < 0.001). Similarly, (+)-catechin inhibited the DNA amplification (p < 0.01) but had no effect on the RT reaction.

In this study, we selected one fragment of SARS-CoV spike protein (S1-(3)) as antigenic determinant by immunoinformatics. Single intrasplenic immunization of plasmid DNA encoding S1-(3) induced anti-spike protein antibodies. We established one hybridoma cell line secreting specific mAb and evaluated this mAb with murine leukemia virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV). The mAb could recognize the spike protein on the MLV/SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells albeit with no neutralizing effect on the infectivity of the pseudotype virus.

We have studied the effects of DQA on two different leukemia cell lines: NB4, derived from acute promyelocytic leukemia, and K562, derived from chronic myeloid leukemia. We found that DQA displays differential cytotoxic activity in these cell lines. In NB4 cells, a low DQA concentration (2microM) induces a mixture of apoptosis and necrosis, whereas a high DQA concentration (20microM) induces mainly necrosis. However, K562 cell death was always by necrosis as the cells showed a resistance to apoptosis at all time-periods and DQA concentrations assayed. In both cell lines, the cell death seems to be mediated by alterations of mitochondrial function as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, O2*- accumulation and ATP depletion. The current study improves the knowledge on DQA as a novel anticancer agent with a potential application in human acute promyelocytic leukemia chemotherapy.","['Galeano, Eva', 'Nieto, Elena', 'Garcia-Perez, Ana Isabel', 'Delgado, M Dolores', 'Pinilla, Montserrat', 'Sancho, Pilar']","['Galeano E', 'Nieto E', 'Garcia-Perez AI', 'Delgado MD', 'Pinilla M', 'Sancho P']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'E7QC7V26B8 (Dequalinium)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dequalinium/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Necrosis', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/17 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2005/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00154-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.03.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Oct;29(10):1201-11. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.03.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern and Western blot analyses have revealed MLF1IP to be present at very low amounts in normal brain tissues, whereas a number of human and rat glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines demonstrated a high level expression of the MLF1IP protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat F98 and C6 GBM tumor models showed that MLF1IP was highly expressed in the tumor core where it was co-localized with MLF1 and nestin. Moreover, MLF1IP expression was elevated in the contralateral brain where no tumor cells were detected.

Here, we show that YAP requires the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) and nuclear body localization to coactivate p73. YAP imparts selectivity to p73 by promoting the activation of a subset of p53 and/or p73 target promoters. Endogenous p73, YAP, and p300 proteins are concomitantly recruited onto the regulatory regions of the apoptotic target gene p53AIP1 only when cells are exposed to apoptotic conditions. Silencing of YAP by specific siRNA impairs p300 recruitment and reduces histone acetylation on the p53AIP1 target gene, resulting in delayed or reduced apoptosis mediated by p73. We also found that YAP contributes to the DNA damage-induced accumulation of p73 and potentiates the p300-mediated acetylation of p73. Altogether, our findings identify YAP as a key determinant of p73 gene targeting in response to DNA damage.","['Strano, Sabrina', 'Monti, Olimpia', 'Pediconi, Natalia', 'Baccarini, Alessia', 'Fontemaggi, Giulia', 'Lapi, Eleonora', 'Mantovani, Fiamma', 'Damalas, Alexander', 'Citro, Gennaro', 'Sacchi, Ada', 'Del Sal, Giannino', 'Levrero, Massimo', 'Blandino, Giovanni']","['Strano S', 'Monti O', 'Pediconi N', 'Baccarini A', 'Fontemaggi G', 'Lapi E', 'Mantovani F', 'Damalas A', 'Citro G', 'Sacchi A', 'Del Sal G', 'Levrero M', 'Blandino G']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, 00158 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (P53AIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (YY1AP1 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/05/17 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2004/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(05)01252-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2005.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2005 May 13;18(4):447-59. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2005.04.008.,,,,,['Mol Cell. 2005 Aug 5;19(3):429'],,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the apoptotic mechanism of DMNQ S-52 in vitro and in vivo in murine solid cancer cells. DMNQ S-52 exerted cytotoxicity against Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells (IC50=12.3 microM). DMNQ S-52 increased Annexin V positive cell population in a concentration-dependent manner. DMNQ S-52 also induced apoptosis through caspase-mediated pathway, including activation of caspase-3, cleavage of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and decreased expression of Bcl-2 in LLC cells in a time and concentration-dependent fashion. DMNQ S-52 activated the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 as well as abrogated the expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a time-dependent manner at 10 microM. Similarly, cell proliferation inhibition by DMNQ S-52 was masked by caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK), JNK inhibitor SP600125 and p38 inhibitor SB203580, but not by MEK inhibitor U0126. Furthermore, i.p. administration of DMNQ S-52 at 5 mg/kg resulted in a potent inhibition of the growth of LLC cells implanted on the right flank of C57BL/6 mice compared to untreated control. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis in DMNQ S-52 treated tumor sections using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DMNQ S-52 may exhibit anti-tumor activity by inducing apoptosis via caspases and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent pathways.","['Lee, Soo Jin', 'Sakurai, Hiroaki', 'Koizumi, Keiichi', 'Song, Gyu Yong', 'Bae, Yong Soo', 'Kim, Hyung-Min', 'Kang, Kyung-Sun', 'Surh, Young-Joon', 'Saiki, Ikuo', 'Kim, Sung Hoon']","['Lee SJ', 'Sakurai H', 'Koizumi K', 'Song GY', 'Bae YS', 'Kim HM', 'Kang KS', 'Surh YJ', 'Saiki I', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Oncology, Graduate School of East-West Medical Science, Kyunghee University, 1 Seochun-ri, Kiheung-eup, Yongin 449-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (6-(1-hydroxyimino-4-methylpentyl)-5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2005/05/17 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(05)00221-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2005.02.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2006 Feb 20;233(1):57-67. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2005.02.042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 has been shown to repress cell death triggered by a diverse array of stimuli including chemotherapy and gamma-irradiation. Chemotherapy of feline lymphoma is generally carried out with antineoplastic drugs, which are reported to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. However, the precise apoptotic signals, induced by chemotherapeutic drugs against feline tumors have not been fully characterized. Therefore, we have evaluated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in FT-1 upon in vitro treatment with these drugs. In the present study, full length of feline Bcl-xL gene was sequenced, and the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNAs in feline lymphoma cell line (FT-1) cultured with doxorubicin, prednisolone or vincristine were investigated. Feline Bcl-xL clone was 1163 base pairs in length and encoded 233 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence was 99.1%, 98.7%, 96.1%, 97.4%, 97.0% and 97.9% homologous to predicted Bcl-xL of dog, human, mouse, pig, rat and sheep, respectively. The levels of Bcl-2 transcripts at 24h incubation in FT-1 stimulated with doxorubicin (0.3mug/ml), prednisolone (0.2mug/ml) and vincristine (5ng/ml) were increased to about 41.0-, 62.0- and 11.1-fold to those in non-stimulated FT-1, respectively. On the other hand, the level of Bcl-xL transcripts at 24h incubation in FT-1 stimulated by doxorubicin and prednisolone were significantly increased about 4.2- and 5.8-folds to the controls and inducible level of Bcl-xL by vincristine was decreased about 0.35-folds.","['Sano, Junichi', 'Nagafuchi, Shunpei', 'Yamazaki, Junpei', 'Oguma, Keisuke', 'Kano, Rui', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko']","['Sano J', 'Nagafuchi S', 'Yamazaki J', 'Oguma K', 'Kano R', 'Hasegawa A']","['Department of Pathobiology, Nihon University School of Veterinary Medicine, 1866, Kameino, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Res Vet Sci,Research in veterinary science,0401300,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cats', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*veterinary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics']",2005/05/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2004/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0034-5288(05)00045-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rvsc.2005.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Res Vet Sci. 2005 Dec;79(3):197-201. doi: 10.1016/j.rvsc.2005.03.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a simple theoretical model, according to the vital characteristics of the leukemic clone (proliferative rate and resistance to apoptosis), I propose a classification of AML into two broad categories: (a) high leukemic clone vitality (HLV) AML or ""dominant type"" AML, corresponding roughly to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification group of entities ""AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities"" and (b) low leukemic clone vitality (LLV) or ""opportunistic type"" AML corresponding to the WHO groups ""AML with multilineage dysplasia"" and ""alkylating agent-related AML"". HLV-AML leukemic clones are characterized by rate-limiting genomic mutations capable of conferring proliferation/survival advantage over a normal hematopoietic environment while in LLV-AML, the leukemic clones are not particularly proliferative or apoptosis-resistant, but are nevertheless selected against an impaired, previously damaged hematopoietic environment. Such a pathogenesis-oriented classification might have therapeutic and prognostic implications, providing a theoretical basis for a further adaptation of the current standard treatment strategies to the individual characteristics of the AML patients.","['Cucuianu, Andrei']",['Cucuianu A'],"['Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology, 73, 21 Decembrie Bvd, 3400 Cluj-Napoca, Cluj Romania. hemato@iocn.ro']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Clone Cells', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/pathology/physiopathology/the rapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Survival Analysis', 'World Health Organization']",2005/05/17 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2004/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(05)00074-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2004.12.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2005;65(1):107-13. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.12.028.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients accrued between January 1998 and January 1999 received irinotecan 125 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 90 min weekly for 4 weeks, every 6 weeks. Eligibility included a performance status of 0-2 by CALGB criteria, and no prior chemotherapy. Twenty-five patients had pleural mesothelioma; two patients had peritoneal mesothelioma, and one patient had pericardial mesothelioma. Sixty-one percent of patients had epithelial histology. RESULTS: There were no complete or partial responders. Thirty-three percent of patients had stable disease and 52% were shown to have progressive disease at the first reassessment. One patient was not evaluable for response. Median survival from study entry was 9.3 months (95% CI 4.5-13.2 months); 1-year survival was estimated at 46% (95% CI 28-65%). Toxicity was moderately severe. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included neutropenia in 28% of patients, lymphopenia in 43%, and diarrhea in 18%. Three patients died of treatment-related toxicities. All three experienced grade 4 diarrhea, two also had neutropenic sepsis. CONCLUSION: Single-agent irinotecan in this dose and schedule has considerable toxicity in patients with malignant mesothelioma and has no anti-tumor activity. The relatively long median survival seen in this study principally reflects the prognostic features of the accrued patients.","['Kindler, Hedy L', 'Herndon, James E', 'Zhang, Chunfeng', 'Green, Mark R']","['Kindler HL', 'Herndon JE', 'Zhang C', 'Green MR']","['University of Chicago, 5841 S.

METHODS: Eligibility criteria included: only one prior chemotherapy program, measurable disease, performance status 0-1, adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Cases were stratified as relapsed or refractory. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were accrued and 52 were eligible of whom 28 had relapsed and 24 had refractory disease. Overall patient characteristics were: median age 63 years (range, 45-79 years), 52% males, 63% performance status 1, 50% adenocarcinoma, 21% squamous, 15% large cell, and 12% undifferentiated NSCLC. In both strata, one patient each (4%) had a partial response and 12 patients each (43% for relapsed, 50% for refractory) had stable disease. Median survival was 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.5-17.0) for relapsed NSCLC and 6.0 months (95% CI, 3.7-9.7) for refractory NSCLC.

A frequency of less than 10% of human astrocytes is estimated to be infectable with HIV-1. Nonetheless, this relatively low percentage of infected astrocytes, but associated with a large total number of astrocytic cells in the CNS, makes human astrocytes a critical part in the analyses of potential HIV-1 reservoirs in vivo. Investigations in astrocytic cell lines and primary human fetal astrocytes revealed that limited HIV-1 replication in these cells resulted from low-level viral entry, transcription, viral protein processing, and virion maturation. Of note, a low ratio of unspliced versus spliced HIV-1-specific RNA was also investigated, as Rev appeared to act aberrantly in astrocytes, via loss of nuclear and/or nucleolar localization and diminished Rev-mediated function. Host cellular machinery enabling Rev function has become critical for elucidation of diminished Rev activity, especially for those factors leading to RNA metabolism. We have recently identified a DEAD-box protein, DDX1, as a Rev cellular co-factor and now have explored its potential importance in astrocytes. Cells were infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins of amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MLV). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) for unspliced, singly-spliced, and multiply-spliced RNA clearly showed a lower ratio of unspliced/singly-spliced over multiply-spliced HIV-1-specific RNA in human astrocytes as compared to Rev-permissive, non-glial control cells. As well, the cellular localization of Rev in astrocytes was cytoplasmically dominant as compared to that of Rev-permissive, non-glial controls. This endogenous level of DDX1 expression in astrocytes was demonstrated directly to lead to a shift of Rev sub-cellular distribution dominance from nuclear and/or nucleolar to cytoplasmic, as input of exogenous DDX1 significantly altered both Rev sub-cellular localization from cytoplasmic to nuclear predominance and concomitantly increased HIV-1 viral production in these human astrocytes. We conclude that altered DDX1 expression in human astrocytes is, at least in part, responsible for the unfavorable cellular microenvironment for Rev function in these CNS-based cells. Thus, these data suggest a molecular mechanism(s) for restricted replication in astrocytes as a potential low-level site of residual HIV-1 in vivo.","['Fang, Jianhua', 'Acheampong, Edward', 'Dave, Rajnish', 'Wang, Fengxiang', 'Mukhtar, Muhammad', 'Pomerantz, Roger J']","['Fang J', 'Acheampong E', 'Dave R', 'Wang F', 'Mukhtar M', 'Pomerantz RJ']","['The Dorrance H.

Imatinib mesilate (STI-571, Gleevec(TM)), an inhibitior of bcr-abl TK, which was primarily designed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia is also an inhibitor of c-kit receptor TK, and is currently the drug of choice for the therapy of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which frequently express constitutively activated forms of the c-kit-receptor. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, is another important target. The two main classes of EGFR inhibitors are the TK inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa(TM)) has been on trial for esophageal and colorectal cancer (CRC) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva(TM)) on trial for esophageal, colorectal, hepatocellular, and biliary carcinoma. In addition, erlotinib has been evaluated in a Phase III study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Cetuximab (IMC-C225, Erbitux(TM)), a monoclonal EGFR antibody, has been FDA approved for the therapy of irinotecan resistant colorectal cancer and has been tested for pancreatic cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are critical regulators of tumor angiogenesis.

METHODS: Sixty-five patients with initial treating acute leukemia were randomly divided into 2 groups, the SFI group (n = 32) treated with SFI plus chemotherapy (CT), the control group (n = 33) treated with CT only. The remission rate, changes of peripheral mature neutrophilic granulocyte (PMNG) count, T-lymphocyte subsets, serum IL-10 and IL-2 before and after treatment were determined. RESULTS: The remission rate in the two groups showed no obvious difference (P > 0.05). After CT for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, the PMNG count decreased in both groups, showing significant difference as compared with that before CT (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The PMNG count at the end of the 3rd and 4th week of CT remounted to higher than that at 1st and 2nd week, and the increment in the SFI group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The levels of CD4, CD4 /CD8, IFN-gamma and IL-2 all increased in the two groups after treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), however, that of IL-10 was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). The difference between the two groups in these criteria after treatment was also significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SFI can improve and regulate the immune function of the patients with acute leukemia undergoing CT, it could promote bone marrow cells proliferation and enhance the efficacy.","['Wei, Ying-Fei', 'Wang, Su-Yun', 'Ren, Li-Li']","['Wei YF', 'Wang SY', 'Ren LL']","[""Department of Hematopathy, Hebei Provincial People's Hospital, Shijiazhuang. yingfeiwei@163.com""]",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood', 'Interleukin-10/blood', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Phytotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",2005/05/17 09:00,2005/11/05 09:00,['2005/05/17 09:00'],"['2005/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2005 Apr;25(4):303-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the toxicity and other biological activities of benthic cyanobacteria from the Baltic Sea are not well known. We determined the biological activities of 21 Anabaena, Calothrix, Nodularia, Nostoc, and Phormidium strains isolated from benthic littoral habitats of the Baltic Sea. We studied whether benthic cyanobacterial extracts caused cytotoxicity by necrosis or induced apoptosis in two mammalian cell lines, a human leukemia cell line (HL-60) and a mouse fibroblast cell line (3T3 Swiss), and examined potential hepatotoxin (microcystin and nodularin) production. Five of the six benthic Anabaena strains, one of the two Nostoc strains, and two of the three Nodularia strains were highly cytotoxic to human leukemia cells. The Calothrix and Phormidium strains did not cause LDH leakage, but the extract of Phormidium strain BECID15 induced apoptosis in the HL-60 cells. Neither the microcystin synthetase E (mcyE) nor the nodularin synthetase F (ndaF) gene was amplified by PCR, and no microcystins or nodularins were detected by the protein phosphatase inhibition assay from the cyanobacterial strains included in this study. This indicates that benthic Baltic cyanobacteria contain potentially harmful cytotoxic compounds even though they do not produce microcystins or nodularins. These cytotoxic compounds remain to be characterized, and the mechanisms of cytotoxicity need to be studied further.","['Surakka, Anu', 'Sihvonen, Leila M', 'Lehtimaki, Jaana M', 'Wahlsten, Matti', 'Vuorela, Pia', 'Sivonen, Kaarina']","['Surakka A', 'Sihvonen LM', 'Lehtimaki JM', 'Wahlsten M', 'Vuorela P', 'Sivonen K']","['Department of Applied Chemistry and Microbiology, Viikinkaari 9, FIN-00014, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/analysis/genetics/*toxicity', 'Biological Assay', 'Cyanobacteria/*chemistry/*pathogenicity', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Fibroblasts', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Necrosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.20119 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2005 Jun;20(3):285-92. doi: 10.1002/tox.20119.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,

It is particularly poor prognosis patients, who are not eligible for HSC transplant, who are likely to benefit most from immunotherapy. It would be hoped that immunotherapy would be used to clear residual tumour cells in these patients in the first remission following standard chemotherapy treatments and this will extend the remission and reduce the risk of a second relapse associated with disease progression and poor mortality rates. In this symposia report, we will focus on whole cell vaccines as an immunotherapeutic option with particular reference to their use in the treatment of AML.

Hematopoietic cells are difficult targets for transduction with currently available vectors. Polylysine based molecular conjugate vectors (MCV) were previously found to effectively transduce both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. A panel of human leukemia cell lines as well as CD34+ selected primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) were tested for differential gene expression utilizing different promoters. Reporter gene expression under the control of RSV and SV40 promoters showed a 6-log fold increase in leukemia cells when compared to primary HPC. Using a polylysine based recombinant molecular conglomerate vector (recMCV) encoding the HSV-tk suicide gene under control of RSV, we demonstrated effective and specific cell killing in all leukemia cell lines as well as in primary human leukemia cells derived from chemotherapy refractory patients, while HPC survived under the same conditions at approximately 20% viability.

Patients in group 2 (on maintenance chemotherapy) and group 3 (patients not receiving therapy for 3-6 months) were vaccinated with diphtheria-tetanus with or without acellular pertussis; group 3 and control subjects were also given measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Preimmunization and 1-month postimmunization titers were drawn. Preimmunization anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibody titers between the groups and the controls were statistically similar. The seropositivity rate for anti-measles antibody in group 3 was significantly lower than controls. After vaccination, all of the patients developed protective anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibody titers. The seroconversion rates of group 3 and controls for anti-measles and anti-mumps antibodies were statistically similar. The results showed that patients on maintenance therapy and after cessation of therapy made good antibody responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, but response to measles and mumps vaccines was not as sufficient as toxoid vaccines. Children with ALL can receive the appropriate vaccines during and after maintenance treatment.","['Ercan, Tugba Erener', 'Soycan, Lebriz Yuksel', 'Apak, Hilmi', 'Celkan, Tiraje', 'Ozkan, Alp', 'Akdenizli, Emine', 'Kasapcopur, Ozgur', 'Yildiz, Inci']","['Ercan TE', 'Soycan LY', 'Apak H', 'Celkan T', 'Ozkan A', 'Akdenizli E', 'Kasapcopur O', 'Yildiz I']","['Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey. tugba.er@turk.net']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine)', '0 (Measles Vaccine)', '0 (Rubella Vaccine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibody Formation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunization/methods', 'Measles Vaccine/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Reference Values', 'Rubella Vaccine/immunology/*therapeutic use']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200505000-00010 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000163214.37147.5a [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 May;27(5):273-7. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000163214.37147.5a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, intrathecal treatment has some adverse effects, such as arachnoiditis, progressive myelopathy, and leukoencephalopathy. The authors describe six children in whom myelopathy and adhesive arachnoiditis developed after administration of intrathecal chemotherapy including methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and prednisolone. Urinary retention and incontinence, the main presenting complaints in all patients, developed within 12 hours after intrathecal therapy and spontaneously resolved within 7 days. Two patients were unable to walk. In these two, weakness in the lower extremities gradually recovered by 1 month but urinary incontinence did not improve. None of the children had sensory loss. On follow-up periodic recurrent urinary tract infection was noted in four patients. MRI findings corresponded to arachnoiditis. No response was recorded on tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials in all patients. Intrathecal chemotherapy, especially methotrexate, can cause spinal cord dysfunction in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Arachnoiditis should be kept in mind as a causative factor in recurrent urinary tract infection in patients receiving intrathecal chemotherapy.","['Bay, Ali', 'Oner, Ahmet Faik', 'Etlik, Omer', 'Yilmaz, Cahide', 'Caksen, Huseyin']","['Bay A', 'Oner AF', 'Etlik O', 'Yilmaz C', 'Caksen H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Yuzuncu Yil University Faculty of Medicine, Van, Turkey. bayalibay@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal/*adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200505000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000162527.85024.e9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 May;27(5):270-2. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000162527.85024.e9.,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Jul;27(7):349-50.

The purpose of this study was to use objective quantitative MR imaging to prospectively assess potential risk factors on the temporal evolution of LE in patients treated for ALL. METHODS: We evaluated the longitudinal prevalence of LE in 45 children treated for ALL in a single institutional protocol including seven courses of IV MTX and no cranial irradiation. Differences in signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images between hyperintense regions and normal-appearing genu were used to quantitatively detect LE. Cox proportional regression was used to estimate the effect of covariates (e.g., sex, MTX dose, age at diagnosis) on the prevalence of LE. After influential factors were identified, a generalized linear model was determined to predict the probability of LE in new patients. The model was necessary to facilitate statistical testing between examinations. RESULTS: Increasing exposure, which corresponding to more courses and higher doses of IV MTX, influenced the prevalence of LE. The prevalence of LE was significant reduced approximately 1.5 years after the completion of IV MTX. CONCLUSION: Higher doses and more courses of IV MTX placed patients at a higher risk for LE; many of the changes resolved after the completion of therapy. The effect of these changes on neurocognitive functioning and quality of life in survivors remains to be determined.","['Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Glass, John O', 'Helton, Kathleen J', 'Langston, James W', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Reddick WE', 'Glass JO', 'Helton KJ', 'Langston JW', 'Xiong X', 'Wu S', 'Pui CH']","[""Division of Translational Imaging Research, Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

It reduces the sample/reagent volume to 1 microl and the hybridization time to 500 s. Both 20mer and 80mer oligonucleotide probes and singly labeled 20mer and 80mer targets, representative of the T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1) gene, have been used to elucidate the performance of this hybridization approach. In this format, called shuttle hybridization, a conventional flat glass DNA microarray is integrated with a PMMA microfluidic chip to reduce the sample and reagent consumption to 1/100 of that associated with the conventional format. A serpentine microtrench is designed and fabricated on a PMMA chip using a widely available CO2 laser scriber. The trench spacing is compatible with the inter-spot distance in standard microarrays. The microtrench chip and microarray chip are easily aligned and assembled manually so that the microarray is integrated with a microfluidic channel. Discrete sample plugs are employed in the microchannel for hybridization. Flowing through the microchannel with alternating depths and widths scrambles continuous sample plug into discrete short plugs. These plugs are shuttled back and forth along the channel, sweeping over microarray probes while re-circulation mixing occurs inside the plugs. Integrating the microarrays into the microfluidic channel reduces the DNA-DNA hybridization time from 18 h to 500 s. Additionally, the enhancement of DNA hybridization reaction by the microfluidic device is investigated by determining the coefficient of variation (CV), the growth rate of the hybridization signal and the ability to discriminate single-base mismatch. Detection limit of 19 amol was obtained for shuttle hybridization. A 1 mul target was used to hybridize with an array that can hold 5000 probes.","['Wei, Cheng-Wey', 'Cheng, Ji-Yen', 'Huang, Chih-Ting', 'Yen, Meng-Hua', 'Young, Tai-Horng']","['Wei CW', 'Cheng JY', 'Huang CT', 'Yen MH', 'Young TH']","['Research Center for Applied Sciences, Academia Sinica Taipei 11529, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation/methods', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*instrumentation/methods', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['33/8/e78 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gni078 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 May 12;33(8):e78. doi: 10.1093/nar/gni078.,,,20050512,,,PMC1110744,,,,,,,,

To directly assess the role of the MIE protein IE1 during the infection of murine CMV (MCMV), we constructed an MCMV with exon 4 of the ie1 gene deleted. We found that, independent of the multiplicity of infection, the resulting recombinant virus, MCMVdie1, which fails to express the IE1 protein, was fully competent for early gene expression and replicated in different cultured cell types with identical kinetics to those of parental or revertant virus. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that MCMVdie1 was greatly impaired in its capacity to disrupt promyelocytic leukemia bodies in NIH 3T3 cells early after infection, a process that has been proposed to increase viral transcription efficiency. We examined MCMVdie1 in the murine model using both immunocompetent BALB/c and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. When MCMVdie1 was inoculated into these two types of mice, significantly lower viral titers were detected in infected organs than in those of the wild-type virus-infected animals. Moreover, the ie1-deficient MCMV exhibited a markedly reduced virulence. While all animals infected with 5 x 10(4) PFU of parental virus died by 30 days postinfection, SCID mice infected with a similar dose of MCMVdie1 did not succumb before 60 days postinfection. The in vivo defective growth phenotype of MCMVdie1 was abrogated upon rescue of ie1. These results demonstrate the significance of the ie1 gene for promoting an acute MCMV infection and virulence yet indicate that MCMV is able to grow in vivo, although impaired, in the absence of the ie1 gene.","['Ghazal, Peter', 'Visser, Astrid E', 'Gustems, Montse', 'Garcia, Rosalia', 'Borst, Eva Maria', 'Sullivan, Kevin', 'Messerle, Martin', 'Angulo, Ana']","['Ghazal P', 'Visser AE', 'Gustems M', 'Garcia R', 'Borst EM', 'Sullivan K', 'Messerle M', 'Angulo A']","['Scottish Centre for Genomic Technology and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Medical School, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Muromegalovirus/*genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virulence/genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/11/7182 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.11.7182-7194.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jun;79(11):7182-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.11.7182-7194.2005.,,['AI-44851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC1112098,,,,,,,,

Using this approach, we were able to identify the nuclear export signal of BLV Rex. Further, we identified a dominant-negative form of BLV Rex. Protein localization analysis revealed that wild-type BLV Rex had a punctate nuclear localization and was associated with nuclear pores. In contrast, the dominant-negative BLV Rex mutation had a diffuse nuclear localization and no nuclear pore association. Overexpression of the dominant-negative BLV Rex altered the localization of the wild-type protein.

Tax exerts its effect through three nonidentical copies of the Tax-responsive element (TxRE), a member of the asymmetric cyclic AMP response element (CRE) family of enhancer sequences. Transactivation is mediated via interaction of Tax with members of the CREB/ATF family bound to TxRE. We have identified a cellular repressor of transcription, activating transcription factor x (ATFx), as a novel Tax-binding protein. In addition to binding directly to Tax we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that ATFx binds to the TxRE enhancer element via the bZIP domain. The functional impact of this bridging interaction results in repression of both basal and Tax-induced transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR. ATFx is unique among ATF family of proteins in that it is cell cycle regulated and exerts a tight repressive control over apoptotic signaling. We propose that recruitment of ATFx to the HTLV-1 LTR serves to link viral transcription with critical events in cellular homeostasis.","['Forgacs, Eva', 'Gupta, Saurabh K', 'Kerry, Julie A', 'Semmes, O John']","['Forgacs E', 'Gupta SK', 'Kerry JA', 'Semmes OJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/11/6932 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.11.6932-6939.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jun;79(11):6932-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.11.6932-6939.2005.,,"['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1112100,,,,,,,,

Viruses lacking both E4orf3 and E4orf6 have a severe replication defect, partially characterized by the formation of genome concatemers. Concatemer formation is dependent upon the cellular Mre11 complex and is prevented by both the E4orf3 and E4orf6 proteins. The Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 proteins are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation by the Ad5 viral E1b55K/E4orf6 complex. The expression of Ad5 E4orf3 causes a redistribution of Mre11 complex members and results in their exclusion from viral replication centers. For this study, we further analyzed the interactions of E4 proteins from different adenovirus serotypes with the Mre11 complex. Analyses of infections with serotypes Ad4 and Ad12 demonstrated that the degradation of Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 proteins is a conserved feature of the E1b55K/E4orf6 complex. Surprisingly, Nbs1 and Rad50 were localized to the replication centers of both Ad4 and Ad12 viruses prior to Mre11 complex degradation. The transfection of expression vectors for the E4orf3 proteins of Ad4 and Ad12 did not alter the localization of Mre11 complex members. The E4orf3 proteins of Ad4 and Ad12 also failed to complement defects in both concatemer formation and late protein production of a virus with a deletion of E4. These results reveal surprising differences among the highly conserved E4orf3 proteins from different serotypes in the ability to disrupt the Mre11 complex.","['Stracker, Travis H', 'Lee, Darwin V', 'Carson, Christian T', 'Araujo, Felipe D', 'Ornelles, David A', 'Weitzman, Matthew D']","['Stracker TH', 'Lee DV', 'Carson CT', 'Araujo FD', 'Ornelles DA', 'Weitzman MD']","['Laboratory of Genetics, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*classification/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phylogeny', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Serotyping', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/11/6664 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.11.6664-6673.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Jun;79(11):6664-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.11.6664-6673.2005.,,"['AI43341/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077342/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77342/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1112111,,,,,,,,

Isolation of tumor cells representing discrete stages of leukemic progression enables the dissection of some of the critical events required for malignant transformation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of multistage leukemogenesis, we developed a microarray transcriptome analysis of nontumorigenic (HS1) and tumorigenic (HS2) proerythroblasts from spi-1-transgenic mice. The data show that transcriptional up-regulation of the sphingosine kinase gene (SPHK1) is a recurrent event associated with the tumorigenic phenotype of these transgenic proerythroblasts. SPHK1 is an enzyme of the metabolism of sphingolipids, which are essential in several biologic processes, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. HS1 erythroleukemic cells engineered to overexpress the SPHK1 protein exhibited growth proliferative advantage, increased clonogenicity, and resistance to apoptosis in reduced serum level by a mechanism involving activation of the extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. In addition, SPHK1-overexpressing HS1 cells acquired tumorigenicity when engrafted in vivo. Finally, enforced expression of a dominant-negative mutant of SPHK1 in HS2 tumorigenic cells or treatment with a pharmacologic inhibitor reduced both cell growth and apoptosis resistance. Altogether, these data suggest that overexpression of the sphingosine kinase may represent an oncogenic event during the multistep progression of an erythroleukemia.","['Le Scolan, Erwan', 'Pchejetski, Dimitri', 'Banno, Yoshiko', 'Denis, Nicole', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Levade, Thierry', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise']","['Le Scolan E', 'Pchejetski D', 'Banno Y', 'Denis N', 'Mayeux P', 'Vainchenker W', 'Levade T', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","[""Inserm U528, Institut Curie, 26, rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris cedex 05, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53091-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-12-4832 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Sep 1;106(5):1808-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-12-4832.

This vector transduces human hematopoietic cells via association of its fiber protein with CD46, a member of the complement regulatory protein family. Major advances in data acquisition and image processing allowed a significant improvement in resolution compared to earlier structures. Analysis of the cryoEM density was enhanced by docking the crystal structures of both the hexon and penton base capsid proteins. CryoEM density was observed for hexon residues missing from the crystal structure that include hypervariable regions and the epitope of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Within the penton base, density was observed for the integrin-binding RGD loop missing from the crystal structure and for the flexible beta ribbon of the variable loop on the side of the penton base. The Ad35 fiber is flexible, consistent with the sequence insert in the third beta-spiral repeat. On the inner capsid surface density is revealed at the base of the hexons and below the penton base. A revised model is presented for protein IX within the virion. Well-defined density was assigned to a conserved domain in the N terminus of protein IX required for incorporation into the virion. For the C-terminal domain of protein IX two alternate conformations are proposed, either binding on the capsid surface or extending away from the capsid. This model is consistent with the tolerance of the C terminus for inserted ligands and its potential use in vector retargeting. This structural study increases our knowledge of Ad capsid assembly, antibody neutralization mechanisms, and may aid further improvements in gene delivery to important human cell types.","['Saban, Susan D', 'Nepomuceno, Ronald R', 'Gritton, Lance D', 'Nemerow, Glen R', 'Stewart, Phoebe L']","['Saban SD', 'Nepomuceno RR', 'Gritton LD', 'Nemerow GR', 'Stewart PL']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Center for Structural Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae/*chemistry/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*chemistry/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(05)00443-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2005.04.034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2005 Jun 10;349(3):526-37. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.04.034.,,"['T32-GM008320/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI42929/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY11431/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL54352/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that TIMP-1 was upregulated up to threefold after treatment with the inflammatory mediator and gp130 ligand oncostatin M (OSM) in human adult cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. The Erk1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 inhibitor SD202190 abolished the effect of OSM on TIMP-1 production in both cell types. Human cardiac myocytes and human cardiac fibroblasts also express MMP-1, 2, 3 and 9, and TIMP-2 constitutively. OSM, however, did not affect the expression of these proteins. In addition also the other gp130 ligands tested, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) had no effect on the expression of TIMPs and MMPs studied. We speculate that OSM by inducing TIMP-1 expression counteracts excessive proteolysis and unrestricted matrix degradation during inflammatory processes in the heart. The notion that OSM favors matrix stabilization in the human heart is further supported by our earlier observation that OSM also upregulates PAI-1, the physiological inhibitor of the protease urokinase-type PA (u-PA), which in turn is essential for extracellular proteolysis. Therefore we propose a role for the gp130 ligand OSM in the modulation of cardiac remodeling and repair processes.","['Weiss, T W', 'Kvakan, H', 'Kaun, C', 'Zorn, G', 'Speidl, W S', 'Pfaffenberger, S', 'Maurer, G', 'Huber, K', 'Wojta, J']","['Weiss TW', 'Kvakan H', 'Kaun C', 'Zorn G', 'Speidl WS', 'Pfaffenberger S', 'Maurer G', 'Huber K', 'Wojta J']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Heart Ventricles/cytology', 'Humans', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/05/14 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/05/14 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2828(05)00105-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2005 Sep;39(3):545-51. doi: 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.03.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, T-cell epitopes derived from shared framework regions (FRs) of each IgHV subfamily capable of inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against the B-cell malignancy, have not been identified. Using the specific PCR primers of seven IgHV gene subfamilies, we amplified the IgHV gene rearrangement for 108 cases of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients. The IgHV gene rearrangement fragments of B-ALL patients were directly sequenced then classified into seven different subfamilies. The T-cell epitopes encoded by the IgHV gene in the B-ALL patients were predicted by SYFPEITHI and BIMAS programs and compared with those from 56 representative germline IgHV sequences in the genebank. For the HLA-A*0201 locus, we found 1 or 2 top score shared epitopes from each subfamily and got 12 epitopes altogether. Results showed that ten of them were in the FRs. Using an antigen-specific T-cell expansion system, we generated the peptide-special CTLs in vitro, which were capable of killing B lymphoma cell lines that belonged to the same IgHV subfamily in a peptide-specific and HLA-restricted manner. Furthermore, we proved that the cytotoxicity of CTLs was IgHV subfamily-specific.

However, for quiescent CD34(+) leukemic cells, this was achieved only by concomitant exposure of the cells to lonafarnib. Ara-C or LY294002 alone blocked the proliferation of these cells but did not kill them, and Ara-C, LY294002 or 17AAG in combination with IM enhanced the cytostatic effect of IM but did not prevent the subsequent regrowth of the surviving leukemic cells.

In this study, we report an inverse correlation of PTHrP with tax/rex mRNA in multiple HTLV-1-positive cell lines and RV-ATL cells. Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with PMA/ionomycin upregulated the PTHrP P3 promoter by a previously characterized Ets binding site and also induced protein/DNA complex formation identical to that observed in RV-ATL cells. Further, we provide evidence that cotransfection with Ets-1 and constitutively active Mek-1 in HTLV-1-negative transformed T cells with stimulation by PMA/ionomycin not only resulted in a robust induction of PTHrP P3 but also formed a complex with ETS-1/P3 EBS similar to that in ATLL cells.

We investigated incidence, associated clinical features, and prognostic implication of FLT3-ITD, but also FLT3-D835 point mutation and N-Ras or K-Ras mutations in 119 APL patients, all prospectively enrolled in the two consecutive APL-93 and APL-2000 trials. Mutation incidences were 38, 20, and 4%, for FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835, and Ras, respectively. The presence of FLT3-ITD was associated with high white blood cell count, high Sanz index, M3-variant subtype, and V/S PML-RAR alpha isoforms. Complete remission (CR), induction death, and death in CR rates were not affected by FLT3 or Ras mutations, as well as cumulative incidence of relapse. However, a trend for a shorter overall survival (P=0.09) was observed in FLT3-ITD patients, because of a very poor postrelapse survival (P=0.02). This feature, which has been also reported in patients with AML in general, is suggestive of an underlying genetic instability in FLT3-ITD patients, leading to the acquisition of additional unknown bad-prognosis gene mutations at relapse.","['Callens, C', 'Chevret, S', 'Cayuela, J-M', 'Cassinat, B', 'Raffoux, E', 'de Botton, S', 'Thomas, X', 'Guerci, A', 'Fegueux, N', 'Pigneux, A', 'Stoppa, A-M', 'Lamy, T', 'Rigal-Huguet, F', 'Vekhoff, A', 'Meyer-Monard, S', 'Ferrand, A', 'Sanz, M', 'Chomienne, C', 'Fenaux, P', 'Dombret, H']","['Callens C', 'Chevret S', 'Cayuela JM', 'Cassinat B', 'Raffoux E', 'de Botton S', 'Thomas X', 'Guerci A', 'Fegueux N', 'Pigneux A', 'Stoppa AM', 'Lamy T', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Vekhoff A', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Ferrand A', 'Sanz M', 'Chomienne C', 'Fenaux P', 'Dombret H']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/05/13 09:00,2005/08/25 09:00,['2005/05/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403790 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403790 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jul;19(7):1153-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403790.,,,,,,,,,,,,['European APL Group'],,

We have identified a putative PcG protein, termed MBT-1, that is associated with Rnf2, an in vivo interactor of PcG proteins. MBT-1 structurally resembles the H-L(3)MBT protein, whose deletion is predicted to be responsible for myeloid hematopoietic malignancies. The human MBT-1 gene is located on chromosome 6q23, a region frequently deleted in leukemia cells, and shows a transient expression spike in response to maturation-inducing stimuli in myeloid leukemia cells. MBT-1(-/-) myeloid progenitor cells exhibit a maturational deficiency but maintain normal proliferative activities. This results in the accumulation of immature myeloid progenitors and hence, a marked decrease of mature myeloid blood cells, causing the MBT-1(-/-) mice to die of anemia during a late embryonic stage. Together, we conclude that MBT-1 specifically regulates the maturational advancement of myeloid progenitor cells during transitions between two developmental stages. We also show that MBT-1 appears to influence myelopoiesis by transiently enhancing p57(KIP2) expression levels.","['Arai, Satoko', 'Miyazaki, Toru']","['Arai S', 'Miyazaki T']","['Center for Immunology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 6000 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Cdkn1c protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (L3MBTL3 protein, human)', '0 (MBT-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Rnf2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2005/05/13 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/13 09:00'],"['2004/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600654 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600654 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2005 May 18;24(10):1863-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600654.

We herein show that Evi1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in embryos and adult bone marrows, suggesting a physiological role of Evi1 in HSCs. We therefore investigate the role and authentic target genes of Evi1 in hematopoiesis using Evi1-/- mice, which die at embryonic day 10.5. HSCs in Evi1-/- embryos are markedly decreased in numbers in vivo with defective self-renewing proliferation and repopulating capacity. Notably, expression rate of GATA-2 mRNA, which is essential for proliferation of definitive HSCs, is profoundly reduced in HSCs of Evi1-/- embryos. Restoration of the Evi1 or GATA-2 expression in Evi1-/- HSCs could prevent the failure of in vitro maintenance and proliferation of HSC through upregulation of GATA-2 expression. An analysis of the GATA-2 promoter region revealed that Evi1 directly binds to GATA-2 promoter as an enhancer. Our results reveal that GATA-2 is presumably one of critical targets for Evi1 and that transcription factors regulate the HSC pool hierarchically.","['Yuasa, Hiromi', 'Oike, Yuichi', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Nishikata, Ichiro', 'Sugiyama, Daisuke', 'Perkins, Archibald', 'Mucenski, Michael L', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Yuasa H', 'Oike Y', 'Iwama A', 'Nishikata I', 'Sugiyama D', 'Perkins A', 'Mucenski ML', 'Suda T', 'Morishita K']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, The Sakaguchi Laboratory, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Angiopoietin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Blood Vessels/embryology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic System/embryology', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, TIE-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Yolk Sac/blood supply']",2005/05/13 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/05/13 09:00'],"['2004/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600679 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600679 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2005 Jun 1;24(11):1976-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600679.

Multiple cell types are involved in the process including angioblasts, vascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, and Muller glial cells. This suggests that multiple growth factors and cytokines are required to regulate retinal vascular development. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a member of the interleukin 6 family of cytokines. LIF is expressed during inflammation and has been reported to affect vascular development in culture; however, its effects in vivo have not been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to determine how LIF could regulate ocular vascular development. METHODS: We have analyzed ocular vascular development in transgenic mice that express LIF in the ocular lens from embryonic day 11. RESULTS: In transgenic mice, LIF reduced development of embryonic vasculature in the eye, and inhibited retinal vascular development. Inhibition in vivo was independent of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) expression. In older transgenic mice, the absence of a retinal vasculature resulted in retinal ischemia and elevated VEGF levels. The upregulation of VEGF resulted in the proliferation of pathological vascular membranes in the vitreous and neovascularization penetrating the retina, which in turn resulted in tractional retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS: LIF is a potent inhibitor of retinal vascular development. These transgenic mice will be useful as a model of persistent fetal vasculature and to study the mechanism for the development of neovascular membranes in the vitreous and could be used to develop inhibitors of tractional detachment.","['Ash, John', 'McLeod, D Scott', 'Lutty, Gerard A']","['Ash J', 'McLeod DS', 'Lutty GA']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA. john-ash@ouhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Eye/blood supply', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Lens, Crystalline/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retinal Detachment/etiology/metabolism', 'Retinal Neovascularization/metabolism/*pathology', 'Retinal Vessels/*growth & development/pathology', '*Transgenes', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2005/05/13 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2005/05/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['v11/a35 [pii]'],epublish,Mol Vis. 2005 Apr 28;11:298-308.,,"['P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY01765/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY09357/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY14206/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",20050428,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that allopregnanolone-induced neurite regression was a prelude to mitogenesis initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium. Supporting this hypothesis, the current data demonstrate that allopregnanolone, in a dose-dependent manner, induces a significant increase in proliferation of neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the rat hippocampus and human neural stem cells (hNSCs) derived from the cerebral cortex. Proliferation was determined by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine and [3H]thymidine, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of murine leukemia virus-green fluorescent protein-labeled mitotic NPCs, and total cell number counting. Allopregnanolone-induced proliferation was isomer and steroid specific, in that the stereoisomer 3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one and related steroids did not increase [3H]thymidine uptake. Immunofluorescent analyses for the NPC markers nestin and Tuj1 indicated that newly formed cells were of neuronal lineage. Furthermore, microarray analysis of cell-cycle genes and real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot validation revealed that allopregnanolone increased the expression of genes that promote mitosis and inhibited the expression of genes that repress cell proliferation. Allopregnanolone-induced proliferation was antagonized by the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel (VGLCC) blocker nifedipine, consistent with the finding that allopregnanolone induces a rapid increase in intracellular calcium in hippocampal neurons via a GABA type A receptor-activated VGLCC (Son et al., 2002). These data demonstrate that allopregnanolone significantly increased rat NPC and hNSC proliferation with concomitant regulation in mitotic cell-cycle genes via a VGLCC mechanism. The therapeutic potential of allopregnanolone as a neurogenic molecule is discussed.","['Wang, Jun Ming', 'Johnston, Patrick B', 'Ball, Bret Gene', 'Brinton, Roberta Diaz']","['Wang JM', 'Johnston PB', 'Ball BG', 'Brinton RD']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology and Program in Neuroscience, Pharmaceutical Science Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (MAP2 protein, rat)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, rat)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'BXO86P3XXW (Pregnanolone)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hippocampus/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/*drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnanolone/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tritium/metabolism']",2005/05/13 09:00,2006/03/23 09:00,['2005/05/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/19/4706 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4520-04.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2005 May 11;25(19):4706-18. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4520-04.2005.,,,,,,PMC6724768,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of BCR-ABL and c-kit accounts for its clinical activity in leukemia and sarcoma, respectively. In this report, we describe other cellular targets for imatinib. Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Imatinib-induced changes were blocked with the EGFR antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of EGFR in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with imatinib demonstrated activation of EGFR and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and EGFR, but not Her2/ErbB2. An in vitro kinase assay showed that imatinib did not directly affect EGFR kinase activity, suggesting involvement of EGFR-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and to a lesser extent transforming growth factor-alpha, reduced imatinib-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Imatinib stimulated the rapid release of soluble HB-EGF and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound HB-EGF, which correlated with biphasic MAPK activation. Together, these results suggested that imatinib affects EGFR activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous EGFR-activating ligands. Although, imatinib primarily inhibits tyrosine kinases, it also stimulates the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients.","['Johnson, Faye M', 'Saigal, Babita', 'Donato, Nicholas J']","['Johnson FM', 'Saigal B', 'Donato NJ']","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.

It is widespread among some tumor types, such as colorectal or endometrial carcinoma, but is rarely found in leukemia. Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (tAML/MDS) is an exception, and MSI is frequent in tAML/MDS following cancer chemotherapy or organ transplantation. The development of MSI+ tumors is associated with an accumulation of insertion/deletion mutations in repetitive sequences. These events can cause inactivating frameshifts or loss of expression of key growth control proteins. We examined established MSI+ cell lines and tAML/MDS cases for frameshift-like mutations of repetitive sequences in several genes that have known, or suspected, relevance to leukemia. CASPASE-5, an acknowledged frameshift target in MSI+ gastrointestinal tract tumors, was frequently mutated in MSI+ cell lines (67%) and in tAML/MDS (29%).

Potential use of p53 gene family marker(s) for aquatic environmental effects monitoring is the long-term goal of this research. The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is fundamental in cell cycle control and apoptosis. It is mutated or differentially expressed in about 50% of all human cancers and p53 family members are differentially expressed in leukemic clams. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the p53 gene in two species of Mytilus, Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus, using RT-PCR with degenerate and specific primers to conserved regions of the gene. The Mytilus p53 proteins are 99.8% identical and closely related to clam (Mya) p53. In particular, the 3' untranslated regions were examined to gain understanding of potential post-transcriptional regulatory pathways of p53 expression. We found nuclear and cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, adenylate/uridylate-rich elements, and a K-box motif previously identified in other, unrelated genes. We also identified a new motif in the p53 3'UTR which is highly conserved across vertebrate and invertebrate species. Differences between the p53 genes of the two Mytilus species may be part of genetic determinants underlying variation in leukemia prevalence and/or development, but this requires further investigation. In conclusion, the conserved regions in these p53 paralogues may represent potential control points in gene expression. This information provides a critical first step in the evaluation of p53 expression as a potential marker for environmental assessment.","['Muttray, Annette F', 'Cox, Rachel L', 'St-Jean, Sylvie', 'van Poppelen, Paul', 'Reinisch, Carol L', 'Baldwin, Susan A']","['Muttray AF', 'Cox RL', 'St-Jean S', 'van Poppelen P', 'Reinisch CL', 'Baldwin SA']","['Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, 2216 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z4. amuttray@vcn.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

The env fragment of BLV was successfully amplified from 33 serologically positive bulk milk samples collected from different geographical areas in the south of Chile. Restriction analysis allowed to classify 17 isolates within the Australian subgroup and 16 within the Belgium subgroup. DNA sequence and multiple alignment analysis of eight Chilean isolates showed a significantly higher frequency of single and double nucleotide substitutions. Most of these mutations were non-silent, resulting in changes at the protein level in several important epitopes of gp51. The Chilean sequences and 59 BLV env sequences available at GenBank, were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis, resulting in four different clusters. The groups identified were not related to those previously defined by restriction analysis. Chilean isolates were included in two different clusters and were genetically not related to isolates collected from neighbouring countries. Considering our results we can conclude: (i) bulk milk samples are suitable to identify the presence of BLV allowing epidemiological and genetic studies to be conducted on large geographical areas; (ii) at least four different genetic groups of BLV were identified by phylogenetic analysis, with Chilean isolates included in two different sub clusters.","['Felmer, R', 'Munoz, G', 'Zuniga, J', 'Recabal, M']","['Felmer R', 'Munoz G', 'Zuniga J', 'Recabal M']","['Unidad de Biotecnologia, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA-Carillanca, Casilla 58-D, Temuco, Chile. rfelmer@carillanca.inia.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', '*Point Mutation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2005/05/12 09:00,2005/08/11 09:00,['2005/05/12 09:00'],"['2005/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1135(05)00137-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2005 Jun 15;108(1-2):39-47. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.04.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result often is transfusion-dependent anemia, an increased risk of infection or hemorrhage, and a potential to progress to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Although progression to acute leukemia can lead to death in patients with MDS, many deaths are consequences of cytopenias and marrow failure in the absence of transformation. Approximately 2/3 of patients succumb to the disease within 3-4 years after presentation, and individuals with high-risk MDS generally survive about 1 year. Given that the disease is more prevalent in the elderly who often have comorbid conditions, the current treatment of MDS consists mainly of supportive care. Curative treatments are restricted to younger, healthy individuals with histocompatible (HLA)-matched donors for allogenic transplant or those able to undergo intensive chemotherapeutic regimens. However, understanding of the pathophysiology of MDS and identification of potential cellular and molecular targets in recent years has led to novel therapeutic approaches. Encouraging results using these heterogeneous therapeutic approaches alone or in combination in Phase I and II trials, have, in turn, called into question previous classification systems and have confirmed the need for an all-encompassing molecular, diagnostic and prognostic staging system.","['Catenacci, Daniel V T', 'Schiller, Gary J']","['Catenacci DV', 'Schiller GJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-3075, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', '*Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging/classification/methods', 'Neutropenia/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/05/12 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/05/12 09:00'],"['2005/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)00005-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2005.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2005 Nov;19(6):301-19. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2005.01.004.,255,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the topological distribution of fluorescence-labeled APRPG-LipADM as well as TUNEL-stained cells in an actual tumor specimen obtained from Colon 26 NL-17 carcinoma-bearing mice. The fluorescence-labeled APRPG-Lip dominantly localized to vessel-like structure: a part of which was also stained with anti-CD31 antibody. Furthermore, TUNEL-stained cells were co-localized to the same structure. These data indicated that APRPG-LipADM bound to angiogenic endothelial cells and induced apoptosis of them. We also investigated the applicability of anti-neovascular therapy using APRPG-LipADM to ADM-resistant P388 solid tumor. As a result, APRPG-LipADM significantly suppressed tumor growth in mice bearing the ADM-resistant tumor.

Recently, modulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and serotonin receptor 1A (5-HTR1A) were implicated in mechanism(s) leading to depression. To gain insight into this mechanism, we assessed the effect of IFN-alpha on the modulation of GR and 5-HTR1A expression. METHODS: Hepatoblastoma, myelocyte-derived and T cell leukemia-derived cell lines were treated with titrated doses of IFN-alpha for different incubation times and analyzed by Western blot, RT-PCR, and microarrays. Dose- and time-dependent decreases of proteins and mRNA levels of GR and 5-HTR1A were observed. RESULTS: The expression of GR and 5-HTR1A in cells treated for 6 days decreased by 74 and 72%, respectively. Recovery was observed following IFN-alpha withdrawal. Co-incubation with tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine) or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine) attenuated the effect of IFN-alpha on GR or 5-HTR1A. GR and 5-HTR1A were unaffected by treatment with either IFN-gamma or tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). However, the effect of IFN-alpha on GR was abolished when used in combination with TUDCA. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, IFN-alpha downregulated GR and 5-HTR1A levels in cell lines. These levels of GR and 5-HTR1A, following IFN-alpha-induced downregulation, recovered after withdrawal of IFN-alpha or addition of desipramine or fluoxetine. These data provide insights regarding pathogenesis of IFN-alpha-induced depression.","['Cai, Wei', 'Khaoustov, Vladimir I', 'Xie, Qing', 'Pan, Tianhong', 'Le, Weidong', 'Yoffe, Boris']","['Cai W', 'Khaoustov VI', 'Xie Q', 'Pan T', 'Le W', 'Yoffe B']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (151B), 2002 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', '112692-38-3 (Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A)', '516-35-8 (Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid)', '60EUX8MN5X (ursodoxicoltaurine)', 'TG537D343B (Desipramine)']",IM,"['Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/pharmacology', 'Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*chemically induced', 'Desipramine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fluoxetine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hepatoblastoma', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/*genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology']",2005/05/12 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/05/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(05)00187-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2005.01.024 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2005 Jun;42(6):880-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2005.01.024.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled in this phase II study (12 in chronic phase, 17 in accelerated phase, and six in blastic phase). Decitabine was administered at 15 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks. DNA methylation was measured using a LINE1 bisulfite/pyrosequencing assay. RESULTS: Complete hematologic responses were seen in 12 patients (34%) and partial hematologic responses in seven patients (20%), for an overall hematologic response rate of 54% (83% in chronic phase, 41% in accelerated phase, and 34% in blastic phase). Major cytogenetic responses were observed in six patients (17%), and minor cytogenetic responses were seen in 10 patients (29%) for an overall cytogenetic response rate of 46%. Median response duration was 3.5 months (range, 2 to 13+ months). Myelosuppression was the major adverse effect, with neutropenic fever in 28 (23%) of 124 courses of therapy. LINE1 methylation decreased from 71.3% +/- 1.4% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to 60.7% +/- 1.4% after 1 week, 50.9% +/- 2.4% after 2 weeks, and returned to 66.5% +/- 2.7% at recovery of counts (median, 46 days). LINE1 methylation at the end of week 1 did not correlate with subsequent responses. However, at day 12, the absolute decrease in methylation was 14.5% +/- 3.0% versus 26.8% +/- 2.7% in responders versus nonresponders (P = .007). CONCLUSION: Decitabine induces hypomethylation and has clinical activity in imatinib refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia. We hypothesize that the inverse correlation between hypomethylation 2 weeks after therapy and response is due to a cell death mechanism of response, whereby resistant cells can withstand more hypomethylation.","['Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Gharibyan, Vazganush', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Morris, Gail', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Issa JP', 'Gharibyan V', 'Cortes J', 'Jelinek J', 'Morris G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Talpaz M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia and Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jpissa@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Benzamides', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2005/05/11 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/05/11 09:00'],"['2005/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.11.981 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.11.981 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 10;23(17):3948-56. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.11.981.

We demonstrate that during primary T cell activation, the absence of Daf on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and on T cells enhances T cell proliferation and augments the induced frequency of effector cells. The effect is factor D- and, at least in part, C5-dependent, indicating that local alternative pathway activation is essential. We show that cognate T cell-APC interactions are accompanied by rapid production of alternative pathway components and down-regulation of Daf expression. The findings argue that local alternative pathway activation and surface Daf protein function respectively as a costimulator and a negative modulator of T cell immunity and explain previously reported observations linking complement to T cell function.

Somatic cells are gained by in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells, however, the differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells varied even between isogenic cell lines. Variable differentiation potentials may either be a consequence of an inherent inhomogeneity of gene expression in the inner cell mass or may have technical reasons. To understand variations in the differentiation potential, we generated pairs of isogenic, monozygotic twin, and single inner cell mass derived clonal embryonic stem cell lines, and demonstrate that they differentially express the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor gene. Variations of leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor protein levels are already evident in the inner cell mass and predispose the cardiomyogenic potential of embryonic stem cell lines in a Janus activated kinase dependent manner. Thus, a single inner cell mass may give rise to embryonic stem cell lines with different developmental potentials.","['Lauss, Martin', 'Stary, Martina', 'Tischler, Julia', 'Egger, Gerda', 'Puz, Sonja', 'Bader-Allmer, Alice', 'Seiser, Christian', 'Weitzer, Georg']","['Lauss M', 'Stary M', 'Tischler J', 'Egger G', 'Puz S', 'Bader-Allmer A', 'Seiser C', 'Weitzer G']","['Max F.

Thus, the modification with SUMO-1 may play a critical role in the nuclear localization and the activation (maturation) of procaspase-2.","['Shirakura, Hiromi', 'Hayashi, Naoko', 'Ogino, Shin-ichi', 'Tsuruma, Kazuhiro', 'Uehara, Takashi', 'Nomura, Yasuyuki']","['Shirakura H', 'Hayashi N', 'Ogino S', 'Tsuruma K', 'Uehara T', 'Nomura Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*metabolism']",2005/05/11 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/05/11 09:00'],"['2005/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)00755-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.04.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Jun 17;331(4):1007-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.04.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was observed that the MuLV4073 was the most efficient pseudotype for hMSC transfection. The proliferation and differentiation characteristics of eGFP-labelled hMSCs were not significantly different from control hMSCs. G418 selected eGFP-labelled cells were cultured for 3 weeks on two porous, commercially available calcium phosphate bioceramics, a ""synthetic hydroxyapatite"" and a ""deproteinised bone"", before implantation into NOD/SCID mice for up to 4 weeks. The eGFP-labelled hMSCs could be readily visualised by their intense green fluorescence both in vitro and in vivo. In ""synthetic hydroxyapatite"" implants the cells remained in a monolayer, whereas in ""deproteinised bone"" implants mineralised tissues were detected by histology, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. From the results, it is concluded that the use of eGFP-labelled hMSCs is an effective tool to trace the fate of hMSCs and evaluate the interactions between cells and ceramics both in vitro and in vivo. This is of great value in prospective assessments of these cell populations for use in tissue engineering applications.","['Xia, Zhidao', 'Ye, Hua', 'Locklin, Rachel M', 'Ferguson, David J P', 'Cui, Zhanfeng', 'Triffitt, James T']","['Xia Z', 'Ye H', 'Locklin RM', 'Ferguson DJ', 'Cui Z', 'Triffitt JT']","['BotnarResearch Centre , Nuffield Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Oxford, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials/*chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramics/*chemistry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Transfection', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",2005/05/11 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/05/11 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0142-9612(05)00184-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2005 Oct;26(29):5790-800. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.018.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Both viruses have simian counterparts (STLV-1 and STLV-2). STLV-3 belongs to a third group of lymphotropic viruses which infect numerous African monkeys species. Among 240 Cameroonian plasma tested for the presence of HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 antibodies, 48 scored positive by immunofluorescence. Among those, 27 had indeterminate western-blot pattern. PCR amplification of pol and tax regions, using HTLV-1, -2 and STLV-3 highly conserved primers, demonstrated the presence of a new human retrovirus in one DNA sample. tax (180 bp) and pol (318 bp) phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the strong relationships between the novel human strain (Pyl43) and STLV-3 isolates from Cameroon. The virus, that we tentatively named HTLV-3, originated from a 62 years old Bakola Pygmy living in a remote settlement in the rain forest of Southern Cameroon. The plasma was reactive on MT2 cells but was negative on C19 cells. The HTLV 2.4 western-blot exhibited a strong reactivity to p19 and a faint one to MTA-1. On the INNO-LIA strip, it reacted faintly with the generic p19 (I/II), but strongly to the generic gp46 (I/II) and to the specific HTLV-2 gp46. The molecular relationships between Pyl43 and STLV-3 are thus not paralleled by the serological results, as most of the STLV-3 infected monkeys have an ""HTLV-2 like"" WB pattern. In the context of the multiple interspecies transmissions which occurred in the past, and led to the present-day distribution of the PTLV-1, it is thus very tempting to speculate that this newly discovered human retrovirus HTLV-3 might be widespread, at least in the African continent.","['Calattini, Sara', 'Chevalier, Sebastien Alain', 'Duprez, Renan', 'Bassot, Sylviane', 'Froment, Alain', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Calattini S', 'Chevalier SA', 'Duprez R', 'Bassot S', 'Froment A', 'Mahieux R', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr Roux, 75015 Paris, France. scalatt@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cameroon', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Deltaretrovirus/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/virology', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2005/05/11 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/05/11 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-30 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 May 9;2:30. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-30.,,,20050509,,,PMC1142341,['GENBANK/DQ020493'],,,,,,,

The common goal of this partnership was to investigate linkages between environmental exposures and childhood cancers. The investigation was comprehensive in nature and a product of an extensive collaborative effort on the part of community, local, state, and federal health agencies, and university research organizations. Central to the success of this partnership was development of a public health response plan. This response plan served to coordinate activities of various entities and ensure that actions to cease or reduce ongoing exposures were implemented in addressing the incidence of childhood cancers using the partnership paradigm. The authors propose six rules of engagement: (1) seek out willing participants, (2) establish an equitable partnership, (3) consider each partner's perspective, (4) define goals and roles for each partner, (5) seek out innovative opportunities, and (6) assure scientific credibility.

Isolated porcine MSCs possessed the ability to proliferate extensively in an antioxidants-rich medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Greater than 40 serial MSC passages and 100 cell population doublings have been recorded for some MSC batches. Early and late passage MSCs were defined here as those cultures receiving less than 5 trypsin passages and more than 15 trypsin passages, respectively. Consistent with their robust ability to proliferate, both the early and late passage MSCs expressed the cell-cycle promoting enzyme p34cdc2 kinase. Late MSCs, however, exhibited certain features reminiscent of cellular aging such as actin accumulation, reduced substrate adherence, and increased activity of lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase. Early MSCs retained the multipotentiality capable of chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic differentiation upon induction in vitro. In contrast, late MSCs were only capable of adipogenic differentiation, which was greatly enhanced at the expense of the osteochondrogenic potential. Along with these changes in multipotentiality, late MSCs expressed decreased levels of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP-7) and reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase. Late MSCs also exhibited attenuated synthesis of the hematopoietic cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and stem cell factor (SCF).

However, the variety of viral vectors and experimental conditions currently used make fragmented or contradictory the information on the transduction efficiency of the human primary keratinocytes. To compare the suitability of the most currently used viral vectors for efficient gene transfer to human keratinocytes, we have performed a comparative study using a panel of recombinant constructs. METHODS: For each vector, the transduction efficiency and the persistence of the transgene expression were quantified by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis of the infected cells. RESULTS: We show that: (1) canine and human adenoviral vectors achieve a highly efficient but transient transduction of both primary and immortalized keratinocytes; (2) the adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) vectors transduce immortalized keratinocytes, albeit with a short-lived gene expression (<4 days), but fail to infect primary keratinocytes; and (3) under appropriate conditions, the oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors can permanently transduce up to 100% of primary keratinocytes, but the highly clonogenic keratinocytes are more efficiently targeted by lentiviral vectors. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, AAV vectors are unsuitable to transduce primary keratinocytes, while human and canine adenoviral vectors appears to be appropriate to achieve short-term delivery of therapeutic products. Recombinant retroviruses provide sustained expression of the transgene, but the lentiviral vectors are the most suitable for ex vivo gene therapy because of their ability to transduce clonogenic primary keratinocytes.","['Gagnoux-Palacios, Laurent', 'Hervouet, Catherine', 'Spirito, Flavia', 'Roques, Stephanie', 'Mezzina, Mauro', 'Danos, Olivier', 'Meneguzzi, Guerrino']","['Gagnoux-Palacios L', 'Hervouet C', 'Spirito F', 'Roques S', 'Mezzina M', 'Danos O', 'Meneguzzi G']","['INSERM U634, Faculty of Medicine, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,,IM,"['Adenoviruses, Canine/*genetics', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dogs', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*transplantation', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.768 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2005 Sep;7(9):1178-86. doi: 10.1002/jgm.768.,,['GAT0201/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,

In this study, expression profiling and tissue microarray studies of 209 and 323 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) respectively, including the most frequent sub-types of NHL, were employed to generate a hypothesis concerning the most common NF-kappaB targets in NHL. These analyses showed that NF-kappaB activation is a common phenomenon in NHL, resulting in the expression of distinct sets of NF-kappaB target genes, depending on the cell context. BCL2 and BIRC5/Survivin were identified as key NF-kappaB targets and their expression distinguished small and aggressive B-cell lymphomas, respectively. Interestingly, in the vast majority of B-cell lymphomas, the expression of these markers was mutually exclusive. A set of genes was identified whose expression correlates either with BIRC5/Survivin or with BCL2. BIRC5/Survivin expression, in contrast to BCL2, was associated with a signature of cell proliferation (overexpression of cell cycle control, DNA repair, and polymerase genes), which may contribute to the aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis of these lymphomas. Strikingly, mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia expressed highly elevated levels of BCL2 protein and mRNA, higher than that observed in reactive mantle zone cells or even in follicular lymphomas, where BCL2 expression is deregulated through the t(14;18) translocation. In parallel with this observation, BIRC5/Survivin expression was higher in Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma than in non-tumoural germinal centre cells. In vitro studies confirmed that NF-kappaB activation contributes to the expression of both markers. In cell lines representing aggressive lymphomas, NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in a decrease in BIRC5/Survivin expression. Meanwhile, in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)-derived lymphocytes, NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in a marked decrease in BCL2 expression.","['Tracey, Lorraine', 'Perez-Rosado, Alberto', 'Artiga, Maria Jesus', 'Camacho, Francisca I', 'Rodriguez, Antonia', 'Martinez, Nerea', 'Ruiz-Ballesteros, Elena', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'Martinez, Beatriz', 'Cuadros, Marta', 'Garcia, Juan F', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Piris, Miguel A']","['Tracey L', 'Perez-Rosado A', 'Artiga MJ', 'Camacho FI', 'Rodriguez A', 'Martinez N', 'Ruiz-Ballesteros E', 'Mollejo M', 'Martinez B', 'Cuadros M', 'Garcia JF', 'Lawler M', 'Piris MA']","['Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Survivin']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1768 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2005 Jun;206(2):123-34. doi: 10.1002/path.1768.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2005 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland'],,,,,

Radiation exposure at a young age is a strong risk factor, but otherwise the etiology is unclear. To explore etiologic clues, we studied the risk of thyroid cancer after an earlier primary cancer, as well as the risk of developing multiple primaries after an earlier thyroid cancer in the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) cancer registries program (1973-2000). In 2,036,597 patients diagnosed with any invasive cancer who survived for a minimum of 2 months, we observed a 42% increased risk compared to the general population for second thyroid cancer based on 1,366 cases (95% confidence interval (CI) = 35-50%; excess absolute risk (EAR) = 0.38/10,000 person-years (PY)). Elevated risks were observed after most cancer sites studied. The most pronounced excess (observed/expected (O/E) = 2.86) was seen for second thyroid cancers detected in the year after diagnosis of the first cancer. Among 29,456 2-month thyroid cancer survivors, 2,214 second cancers occurred (O/E = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.15; EAR = 7.64/10,000 PY). Again, the highest risk was seen in the first year (O/E = 1.26). Patients <40 years of age at diagnosis of thyroid cancer had a 39% increased risk of a second cancer, whereas for older patients the risk was elevated 6%. We observed consistently increased risks for cancers of the breast, prostate, and kidney, and a likely radiation treatment-related excess of leukemia. Based on small numbers of cases, cancers of the salivary glands, trachea, scrotum, adrenal glands, and brain and central nervous system (CNS) also occurred in excess. A decreased risk was observed for smoking-related malignancies. Thyroid cancer is associated with primary cancers of many different organs. Although enhanced medical surveillance likely plays a role, 2-way, positive associations between thyroid cancer and cancers of the breast, prostate, kidney, salivary glands, brain and CNS, scrotum, and leukemia suggest etiologic similarities and possible treatment effects.","['Ronckers, Cecile M', 'McCarron, Peter', 'Ron, Elaine']","['Ronckers CM', 'McCarron P', 'Ron E']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892-7238, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21064 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2005 Nov 1;117(2):281-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21064.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substantial number of recurrent balanced aberrations (RBAs), in particular, reciprocal translocations, occur with remarkable specificity in association with clinical and tumor characteristics. This information has become increasingly important both in basic cancer research, as a means to identify pathogenetically important genes, and clinically, as a diagnostic and prognostic instrument. Knowledge of the frequencies of such aberrations thus is of theoretical as well as practical value. However, it is unknown to what extent the data available in the literature reflect reality. A large proportion of the published cases, at least 40%, are biased, in the sense that they were reported because of a specific or unusual karyotypic feature. We have systematically ascertained all RBAs and present data on the frequencies of these abnormalities and their molecular genetic consequences among unselected patients, that is, those studied as part of investigations of consecutive series of individuals with a particular neoplastic disorder. The salient features of the present study are: (1) published data clearly overestimate the prevalence of individual RBAs in most tumor types as well as the proportion of patients having such aberrations. In fact, several well-known published RBAs are not recurrent or have not even been seen among unselected patients, and in no tumor entity, except for chronic myeloid leukemia, does the frequency of unselected cytogenetically abnormal neoplasms with RBAs exceed 35%; (2) the proportions of unselected cases characterized by RBAs among those tumor entities in which at least one RBA has been identified vary considerably both within and among hematologic malignancies, malignant lymphomas, and solid tumors; and (3) the molecular consequences of a substantial proportion, ranging from 19% in hematologic malignancies to 65% in epithelial tumors, of the most common RBAs in unselected patients remain to be clarified.","['Mitelman, Felix', 'Mertens, Fredrik', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Mitelman F', 'Mertens F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. felix.mitelman@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['*Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Chromosomal Instability', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/ultrastructure']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20212 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Aug;43(4):350-66. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20212.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,

These findings suggest that PGD(2) specifically suppressed IgE-mediated scratching by inhibiting IgE-mediated histamine release from mast cells.","['Hashimoto, Yuki', 'Arai, Iwao', 'Tanaka, Makoto', 'Nakaike, Shiro']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Arai I', 'Tanaka M', 'Nakaike S']","['Department of Pharmacology Laboratory, Medicinal Research Laboratory, Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Saitama 331-9530, Japan']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,J Pharmacol Sci,Journal of pharmacological sciences,101167001,"['37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Prostaglandin D2/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pruritus/chemically induced/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Rats']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/12/31 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jphs/SC0040209 [pii]', '10.1254/jphs.sc0040209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Sci. 2005 May;98(1):90-3. doi: 10.1254/jphs.sc0040209.

We compared genotyping and phenotyping of the four inhibitory KIRs that are important in transplantation for leukemia in 73 unrelated persons. In 5 (7%) of the 68 individuals in whom the KIR2DL1 gene was present and in 10 (15%) of the 67 in whom KIR3DL1 was present, the corresponding receptor was not expressed by NK cells, as determined by flow cytometry analysis. In contrast, one or both allelic forms of KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3 were expressed by a high proportion of NK cells in all 73 individuals. However if both KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 genes were present, KIR2DL3 was preferentially expressed, as transcripts of KIR2DL2 was not detectable by RT-PCR in 42% of these individuals. In total, repertoire assessment for the four KIRs by genotyping vs phenotyping was not in complete agreement in 18 (25%) of the 73 individuals. Furthermore, among the samples that tested positive for the expression of a certain KIR gene, the levels of transcripts and surface expression varied considerably as measured by both real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry analysis. Extension of this comparative analysis to include all 12 KIR family members showed that KIR2DL3 and KIR3DL2 were the only genes whose transcripts were consistently detectable. These results caution the use of genotyping alone for donor selection or leukemia-relapse prognostication because some KIRs may be expressed at a very low level.","['Leung, Wing', 'Iyengar, Rekha', 'Triplett, Brandon', 'Turner, Victoria', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Holladay, Marti S', 'Houston, James', 'Handgretinger, Rupert']","['Leung W', 'Iyengar R', 'Triplett B', 'Turner V', 'Behm FG', 'Holladay MS', 'Houston J', 'Handgretinger R']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. wing.leung@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (KIR2DL1 protein, human)', '0 (KIR2DL2 protein, human)', '0 (KIR2DL3 protein, human)', '0 (KIR3DL1 protein, human)', '0 (KIR3DL2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL1)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL2)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL2)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'DNA Methylation', '*Donor Selection/methods', 'Genotype', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1', 'Receptors, KIR2DL2', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1', 'Receptors, KIR3DL2', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/10/6540 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6540 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 15;174(10):6540-5. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6540.,,['P30CA21765-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Human mast cell clone 1 (HMC1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cell lines were transfected with PR3 or the inactive mutated PR3 (PR3S203A) or HNE cDNA. In both RBL/PR3 and HMC1/PR3, a constitutive activity of caspase-3 was measured with DEVD substrate, due to the direct processing of procaspase-3 by PR3. No caspase-3 activation was observed in cells transfected with the inactive PR3 mutant or HNE. Despite the high caspase-3 activity in RBL/PR3, no apoptosis was detected as demonstrated by an absence of 1) phosphatidylserine externalization, 2) mitochondria cytochrome c release, 3) upstream caspase-8 or caspase-9 activation, or 4) DNA fragmentation. In vitro, purified PR3 cleaved procaspase-3 into an active 22-kDa fragment. In neutrophils, the 22-kDa caspase-3 activation fragment was present only in resting neutrophils but was absent after apoptosis. The 22 kDa fragment was specific of myeloid cells because it was absent from resting lymphocytes. This 22-kDa fragment was not present when neutrophils were treated with pefabloc, an inhibitor of serine proteinase. Like in HMC1/PR3, the 22-kDa caspase-3 fragment was restricted to the plasma membrane compartment. Double immunofluorescence labeling after streptolysin-O permeabilization further showed that PR3 and procaspase-3 could colocalize in an extragranular compartment. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that compartmentalized PR3-induced caspase-3 activation might play specific functions in neutrophil survival.","['Pederzoli, Magali', 'Kantari, Chahrazade', 'Gausson, Valerie', 'Moriceau, Sandra', 'Witko-Sarsat, Veronique']","['Pederzoli M', 'Kantari C', 'Gausson V', 'Moriceau S', 'Witko-Sarsat V']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 507, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris 5, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Enzyme Precursors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myeloblastin', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/*physiology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/10/6381 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6381 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 15;174(10):6381-90. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated mechanisms of macrophage activation with anti-CD40 mAb treatment, assessed by the antitumor action of macrophages in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD40 mAb into C57BL/6 mice resulted in activation of peritoneal macrophages capable of suppressing B16 melanoma cell proliferation in vitro, an effect that was greatly enhanced by LPS and observed against several murine and human tumor cell lines. Anti-CD40 mAb also primed macrophages in vitro to mediate cytostatic effects in the presence of LPS. The tumoristatic effect of CD40 ligation-activated macrophages was associated with apoptosis and killing of tumor cells. Activation of macrophages by anti-CD40 mAb required endogenous IFN-gamma because priming of macrophages by anti-CD40 mAb was abrogated in the presence of anti-IFN-gamma mAb, as well as in IFN-gamma-knockout mice. Macrophages obtained either from C57BL/6 mice depleted of T and NK cells by Ab treatment, or from scid/beige mice, were still activated by anti-CD40 mAb to mediate cytostatic activity. These results argued against the role of NK and T cells as the sole source of exogenous IFN-gamma for macrophage activation and suggested that anti-CD40 mAb-activated macrophages could produce IFN-gamma. We confirmed this hypothesis by detecting intracytoplasmic IFN-gamma in macrophages activated with anti-CD40 mAb in vivo or in vitro. IFN-gamma production by macrophages was dependent on IL-12. Taken together, the results show that murine macrophages are activated directly by anti-CD40 mAb to secrete IFN-gamma and mediate tumor cell destruction.","['Buhtoiarov, Ilia N', 'Lum, Hillary', 'Berke, Gideon', 'Paulnock, Donna M', 'Sondel, Paul M', 'Rakhmilevich, Alexander L']","['Buhtoiarov IN', 'Lum H', 'Berke G', 'Paulnock DM', 'Sondel PM', 'Rakhmilevich AL']","['Department of Human Oncology and UW Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytoplasm/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Ligands', 'Macrophage Activation/genetics/*immunology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/10/6013 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 15;174(10):6013-22. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6013.,,"['R01 CA087025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008692/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because rapamycin suppresses the oncogenic processes sustained by PI3k/Akt, we investigated whether rapamycin affects blast survival. We found that rapamycin induces apoptosis of blasts in 56% of the bone marrow samples analyzed. Using the PI3k inhibitor wortmannin, we show that the PI3k/Akt pathway is involved in blast survival. Moreover, rapamycin increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis even in nonresponder samples. Anthracyclines activate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and disruption of this signaling pathway increases the efficacy of apoptogenic stimuli. Rapamycin inhibited doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB in ALL samples. Using a short interfering (si) RNA approach, we demonstrate that FKBP51, a large immunophilin inhibited by rapamycin, is essential for drug-induced NF-kappaB activation in human leukemia. Furthermore, rapamycin did not increase doxorubicin-induced apoptosis when NF-kappaB was overexpressed. In conclusion, rapamycin targets 2 pathways that are crucial for cell survival and chemoresistance of malignant lymphoblasts--PI3k/Akt through the mammalian target of rapamycin and NF-kappaB through FKBP51--suggesting that the drug could be beneficial in the treatment of childhood ALL.","['Avellino, Raffaella', 'Romano, Simona', 'Parasole, Rosanna', 'Bisogni, Rita', 'Lamberti, Annalisa', 'Poggi, Vincenzo', 'Venuta, Salvatore', 'Romano, Maria Fiammetta']","['Avellino R', 'Romano S', 'Parasole R', 'Bisogni R', 'Lamberti A', 'Poggi V', 'Venuta S', 'Romano MF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnologies, Federico II University, Via S.

In previous studies we demonstrated the importance of a 3,5-dimethoxy motif in conferring pro-apoptotic activity to stilbene based compounds so we now wanted to evaluate the ability of pterostilbene and 3,5-hydroxypterostilbene in inducing apoptosis in sensitive and resistant leukemia cells. When tested in sensitive cell lines, HL60 and HUT78, 3'-hydroxypterostilbene was 50-97 times more potent than trans-resveratrol in inducing apoptosis, while pterostilbene appeared barely active. However, both compounds, but not trans-resveratrol and piceatannol, were able to induce apoptosis in the two Fas-ligand resistant lymphoma cell lines, HUT78B1 and HUT78B3, and the multi drug-resistant leukemia cell lines HL60-R and K562-ADR (a Bcr-Abl-expressing cell line resistant to imatinib mesylate). Of note, pterostilbene-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by the pancaspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that this compound acts through a caspase-independent pathway. On the contrary, 3'-hydroxypterostilbene seemed to trigger apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway: indeed, it caused a marked disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential delta psi and its apoptotic effects were inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9-inhibitor Z-LEHD-fmk. Moreover, pterostilbene and 3'-hydroxypterostilbene, when used at concentrations that elicit significant apoptotic effects in tumor cell lines, did not show any cytotoxicity in normal hemopoietic stem cells.

The studies described herein assess the attributes of a liposome formulation required to significantly increase the plasma levels of idarubicin and further establish whether increases in the circulation longevity of the drug mediate improved antitumor activity. Pharmacokinetic assessments of 6 different 3[H]-labelled liposome formulations were compared to free idarubicin. The highest idarubicin plasma concentrations were observed with DSPC/DSPE-PEG2000 liposomes formulated with 2 mol% DSPE-PEG2000 and 150 mM (iso-osmotic) internal citrate concentration. It was shown that increased levels of PEG-lipid incorporation augmented IDA release and the optimal liposomal formulation needed to be prepared under iso-osmotic conditions. For efficacy studies in a murine leukemia model, groups of 12-14 mice were treated i.v. with saline or equivalent doses (1, 2, 3 mg/kg) of free or liposomal IDA.

Here, we demonstrate distinct regulation of IKK activity in ATL and HTLV-I-transformed T cells in response to protein synthesis inhibition or arsenite treatment. Protein synthesis inhibition for 4 h by cycloheximide (CHX) barely affects IKK activity in Tax-positive HTLV-I-transformed cells, while it diminishes IKK activity in Tax-negative ATL cells. Treatment of ATL cells with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to protein synthesis inhibition reverses the inhibitory effect of CHX, and MG132 alone greatly enhances IKK activity. In addition, treatment of HTLV-I-transformed cells with arsenite for 1 h results in down-regulation of IKK activity without affecting Tax expression, while 8 h of arsenite treatment does not impair IKK activity in ATL cells. These results indicate that a labile protein sensitive to proteasome-dependent degradation governs IKK activation in ATL cells, and suggest a molecular mechanism of IKK activation in ATL cells distinct from that in HTLV-I-transformed T cells.","['Miura, Hideyasu', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Yamaoka, Shoji']","['Miura H', 'Maeda M', 'Yamamoto N', 'Yamaoka S']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cycloheximide/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(05)00164-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2005 Aug 1;308(1):29-40. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.04.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In T and B cells, it appears crucial for both development and functions, while, in non-lymphoid hematopoietic cells, Vav seems not involved in cell maturation, but rather in the response of mature cells to agonist-dependent proliferation and phagocytosis. We have previously demonstrated that the amount and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav are up-regulated in both whole cells and nuclei of tumoral promyelocytes induced to granulocytic maturation by ATRA and that tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav does not display any ATRA-induced GEF activity but contributes to the regulation of PI 3-K activity. In this study, we report that Vav accumulates in nuclei of ATRA-treated APL-derived cells and that the down-modulation of Vav prevents differentiation of tumoral promyelocytes, indicating that it is a key molecule in ATRA-dependent myeloid maturation. On the other hand, the overexpression of Vav induces an increased expression of surface markers of granulocytic differentiation without affecting the maturation-related changes of the nuclear morphology. Consistent with an effect of Vav on the transcriptional machinery, array profiling shows that the inhibition of the Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav reduces the number of ATRA-induced genes. Our data support the unprecedented notion that Vav plays crucial functions in the maturation process of myeloid cells, and suggest that Vav can be regarded as a potential target for the therapeutic treatment of myeloproliferative disorders.","['Bertagnolo, Valeria', 'Brugnoli, Federica', 'Mischiati, Carlo', 'Sereni, Alessia', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Carini, Cinzia', 'Capitani, Silvano']","['Bertagnolo V', 'Brugnoli F', 'Mischiati C', 'Sereni A', 'Bavelloni A', 'Carini C', 'Capitani S']","['Signal Transduction Unit-Laboratory of Cell Biology, Section of Human Anatomy, Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara, 66, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2004/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(04)00719-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2005 May 15;306(1):56-63. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.12.001.

Interestingly, gamma-secretase cleaves several proteins including Notch, E-cadherin, CD44 and ErbB-4 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4), which are important modulators of angiogenesis. The beta-amyloid precursor protein, which is cleaved by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase to produce beta-amyloid, is highly expressed in the endothelium of neoforming vessels suggesting that it might play a role during angiogenesis. These data prompted us to explore the effects of beta and gamma-secretase inhibitors of different structures on angiogenesis and tumor growth. Both the gamma and beta-secretase inhibitors tested reduce endothelial cell proliferation without inducing cellular toxicity, suppress the formation of capillary structures in vitro and oppose the sprouting of microvessel outgrowths in the rat aortic ring model of angiogenesis. Moreover, they potently inhibit the growth and vascularization of human glioblastoma and human lung adenocarcinoma tumors xenotransplanted into nude mice. Altogether these data suggest that the gamma and beta-secretases play an essential role during angiogenesis and that inhibitors of the beta and gamma-secretases may constitute new classes of anti-angiogenic and anti-tumoral compounds.","['Paris, Daniel', 'Quadros, Amita', 'Patel, Nikunj', 'DelleDonne, Anthony', 'Humphrey, James', 'Mullan, Michael']","['Paris D', 'Quadros A', 'Patel N', 'DelleDonne A', 'Humphrey J', 'Mullan M']","['The Roskamp Institute, 2040 Whitfield Avenue, Sarasota, FL 34243, USA. dparis@rfdn.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (L 685458)', '0 (N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)alanyl)phenylglycine tert-butyl ester)', '0 (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl-leucyl-leucinal)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.46 (BACE1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.23.46 (Bace1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Brain/cytology', 'Capillaries/drug effects/growth & development', 'Carbamates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endopeptidases', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Morphogenesis/drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/blood supply/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*prevention & control', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/05/10 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/05/10 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(05)00243-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.02.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2005 May 2;514(1):1-15. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.02.050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusions, TEL/AML1 and BCR/ABL, and rearrangements of the MLL gene occurred at frequencies of 22% (n = 447/2027) (25% in B-lineage ALL), 2% (n = 43/2027) and 2% (n = 47/2016) respectively. There was considerable variation in iFISH signal patterns both between and within patient samples. The TEL/AML1 probe showed the highest incidence of variation (59%, n = 524/884), which included 38 (2%) patients with clustered, multiple copies of AML1. We were thus able to define amplification of AML1 as a new recurrent abnormality in ALL, associated with a poor prognosis. Amplification involving the ABL gene, a rare recurrent abnormality confined to T ALL patients, was identified for the first time. The use of centromeric probes revealed significant hidden high hyperdiploidy of 33% and 59%, respectively, in patients with normal (n = 21/64) or failed (n = 32/54) cytogenetic results. The iFISH contributed significantly to the high success rate of 91% (n = 2114/2323) and the remarkable abnormality detection rate of 89% (n = 1879/2114).

Although considered to be a low-risk leukaemia, it is associated with a relapse rate of 10-20%. The coexistence of different subclones at diagnosis, based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of IG/TCR gene rearrangement, with differential response to chemotherapy, was recently reported in this subtype of ALL. We wished to demonstrate such subclones at diagnosis by a recently developed technique of quantitative multiparametric fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Bone marrow cells from 80 paediatric patients with ALL at diagnosis were analysed for the presence of the TEL/AML1 fusion gene by interphase FISH. Fourteen patients were positive for the translocation. Four of them had several subclones associated with various combinations of additional chromosomal abnormalities. The most striking was an atypical and unexpected hybridization pattern consistent with a submicroscopic deletion of the 5' region of the AML1 breakpoint. Other abnormalities included TEL deletion, trisomy and tetrasomy 21 as well as double TEL-AML1 fusion.

It can be selectively induced in many tumor types by a number of compounds including dimethyl fumarate and sulforaphane. Mitomycin C is a bioreductive agent that is used clinically for treatment of solid tumors. RH1 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)- 6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone) is a new bioreductive agent currently in clinical trials. We have shown previously that induction of NQO1 can enhance the antitumor activity of mitomycin C in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. As RH1 is activated selectively by NQO1 while mitomycin C is activated by many reductive enzymes, we investigated whether induction of NQO1 would produce a greater enhancement of the antitumor activity of RH1 compared with mitomycin C. HCT116 human colon cancer cells and T47D human breast cancer cells were incubated with or without dimethyl fumarate or sulforaphane followed by mitomycin C or RH1 treatment, and cytotoxic activity was measured by a clonogenic (HCT116) or MTT assay (T47D). Dimethyl fumarate and sulforaphane treatment increased NQO1 activity by 1.4- to 2.8-fold and resulted in a significant enhancement of the antitumor activity of mitomycin C, but not of RH1. This appeared to be due to the presence of a sufficient constitutive level of NQO1 activity in the tumor cells to fully activate the RH1. Mice were implanted with HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, which have low levels of NQO1 activity. The mice were fed control or dimethyl fumarate-containing diet and were treated with RH1. NQO1 activity in the tumors increased but RH1 produced no antitumor activity in mice fed control or dimethyl fumarate diet. This is consistent with a narrow window of NQO1 activity between no RH1 activation and maximum RH1 activation. This study suggests that selective induction of NQO1 in tumor cells is not likely to be an effective strategy for enhancing the antitumor activity of RH1. In addition, we found that RH1 treatment produced significant leukopenia in mice that may be of concern in the clinic. These results suggest that the ease of reduction of RH1 by NQO1 makes it a poor candidate for an enzyme-directed approach to cancer therapy.","['Digby, Tyler', 'Leith, Marsha K', 'Thliveris, James A', 'Begleiter, Asher']","['Digby T', 'Leith MK', 'Thliveris JA', 'Begleiter A']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, CancerCare Manitoba, University of Manitoba, 675 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (Nqo1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Aziridines/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitomycin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/05/07 09:00,2005/08/17 09:00,['2005/05/07 09:00'],"['2004/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0961-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2005 Sep;56(3):307-16. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0961-4.

One of these subsets of patients carry a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, the so called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+). The result of this translocation is the fusion oncogene, Bcr-Abl, which is uniquely expressed in the leukemia clone, and as such has the potential to initiate antileukemic immune responses against the leukemia blasts. We utilized a murine model of Ph+ ALL to look at the ability of systemic interleukin 12 (IL-12) treatments to initiate antileukemic immune responses, and studied the mechanisms by which it does so. We found that IL-12 was able to eliminate pre-established leukemia, and that this protection was mediated by CD4, CD8, and NK cells in combination. While IL-12 was able to eliminate pre-established leukemia, it did not elicit immunologic memory. Consistent with previous work, vaccination with irradiated leukemia cells transduced with immunomodulator genes was able to establish long-term memory, and, when used with IL-12, was able to eradicate pre-existing disease and induce resistance to subsequent leukemia challenge. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of an immunotherapeutic approach towards the treatment of Ph+ ALL.","['Gruber, Tanja A', 'Skelton, Dianne C', 'Kohn, Donald B']","['Gruber TA', 'Skelton DC', 'Kohn DB']","['Division of Research Immunology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Immunologic Factors/genetics', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vaccination/methods']",2005/05/07 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/05/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['7700839 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cgt.7700839 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2005 Oct;12(10):818-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the lymphoma cells in all animals expressed TNF-RII, but not TNF-RI. Although, in EBL, lymphoma cells of which the histopathological and immunological property differs has been formed, the expression patterns of TNF-Rs had the universality in all lymphoma cells.

Using these proteins, binding assays were performed in various mammalian cell lines. The binding properties of the Env-STs that contain the putative receptor binding domain (RBD) did not correlate with the susceptibility to the pseudotype viruses having PERV envelopes, whereas those of the Env-SUs correlated fairly well. These results suggested that the Env-SUs but not Env-STs interacted with their receptors in various cell lines.
