Many groups have established FA registries. In Tunisia, in collaboration with the Tunisian Fanconi Anemia Study Group (TFASG), we set up the Tunisian Fanconi Anemia Registry (TFAR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We contacted all hematology and pediatrics departments to include their FA patients diagnosed between January 1983 and December 2008. The registry is available on the TFASG web site (www.fanconi-tunisie.net). RESULTS: Sorting the files brought out 142 patients belonging to 118 families. The mean age at diagnosis was 11 years. There was consanguinity in 86%, malformative syndrome in 91%, and pancytopenia at diagnosis in 69%. Of 28 patients, 95% belonged to the FANCA group. Androgen treatment was given in 109 cases and genoidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 27 patients. The diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome was retained in 4%, acute leukemia in 6%, and a solid tumor in 2%. The median overall survival time in all patients is 17 years 5 months; it is significantly better in patients having received allografts (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: FA seems frequent in Tunisia, which is in part explained by the high consanguinity and endogamy in this country. Hematologic impairment is still the most frequent revealing circumstance of the disease. It is often severe or moderate and requires androgen treatment or bone marrow transplantation. BMT should be proposed to all patients with an HLA-compatible donor.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is characterized by hypersensitivity of JMML cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in vitro. The pathogenesis of JMML seems to arise from constitutional activation of the GM-CSF/RAS (a GTPase) signaling pathway, a result of mutations in RAS, NF1, PTPN11, and CBL that interfere with downstream components of the pathway. Most patients with JMML usually experience an aggressive clinical course, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment, although the high rates of relapses and graft failures are of great concern. In contrast, a certain proportion of patients experience a stable clinical course for a considerable period of time, and sometimes the disease even spontaneously resolves without any treatment. Recent studies have provided us with increased knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations in JMML, and suggested that differences in clinical courses may reflect genetic status. Thus, genotype-based management is of current international interest, especially for JMML with RAS mutations. Cumulative evidence suggests that RAS mutations can be related to favorable clinical outcomes, and HSCT may not have to be a mandatory therapeutic option for a portion of patients with this mutation, although a consensus regarding genotype-based management has not yet been achieved.

To investigate the feature of Notch1 mutation and its corresponding expression level in Chinese patients with T-ALL, detection of mutation and the expression level of Notch1 gene was preformed using RT-PCR, sequencing and real-time PCR respectively. RESULTS: Two Notch1 point mutations (V1578E and L1593P) located on HD-N domain were identified in three cases out of 13 T-ALL patients. The mutation on 4733 position (V1578E) found in two cases was a novel mutation. The overexpression of Notch1 was detected in all samples with T-ALL, moreover, significantly higher expression of Notch1 was detected in the T-ALL with Notch1 mutation group compared with T-ALL with WT Notch1 group (p = 0.0192).

With cure rates now approximately 80%, robust pre-clinical models are necessary to prioritize active new drugs for clinical trials in relapsed/refractory patients, and the ability of these models to predict synergy/antagonism with established therapy is an essential attribute. In this study, we report optimization of an induction-type regimen by combining VCR, dexamethasone (DEX) and ASP (VXL) against ALL xenograft models established from patient biopsies in immune-deficient mice. We demonstrate that the VXL combination was synergistic in vitro against leukemia cell lines as well as in vivo against ALL xenografts. In vivo, VXL treatment caused delays in progression of individual xenografts ranging from 22 to >146 days. The median progression delay of xenografts derived from long-term surviving patients was 2-fold greater than that of xenografts derived from patients who died of their disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that systemic DEX exposure in mice increased 2-fold when administered in combination with VCR and ASP, consistent with clinical findings, which may contribute to the observed synergy between the 3 drugs. Finally, as proof-of-principle we tested the in vivo efficacy of combining VXL with either the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor, ABT-737, or arsenic trioxide to provide evidence of a robust in vivo platform to prioritize new drugs for clinical trials in children with relapsed/refractory ALL.",,"['Szymanska, Barbara', 'Wilczynska-Kalak, Urszula', 'Kang, Min H', 'Liem, Natalia L M', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Boehm, Ingrid', 'Groepper, Daniel', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Stewart, Clinton F', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Szymanska B', 'Wilczynska-Kalak U', 'Kang MH', 'Liem NL', 'Carol H', 'Boehm I', 'Groepper D', 'Reynolds CP', 'Stewart CF', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120329,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/04/06 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0033894 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-16681 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e33894. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0033894.

Recent studies showed that XMRV is a recombinant mouse retrovirus; hence, its association with human diseases has become questionable. Here, we demonstrated that XMRV envelope (Env)-mediated pseudoviral infection is not blocked by lysosomotropic agents and cellular protease inhibitors, suggesting that XMRV entry is not pH-dependent. The full length XMRV Env was unable to induce syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion, even in cells overexpressing the viral receptor, XPR1. However, truncation of the C-terminal 21 or 33 amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of XMRV Env induced substantial membrane fusion, not only in the permissive 293 cells but also in the nonpermissive CHO cells that lack a functional XPR1 receptor. The increased fusion activities of these truncations correlated with their enhanced SU shedding into culture media, suggesting conformational changes in the ectodomain of XMRV Env. Noticeably, further truncation of the CT of XMRV Env proximal to the membrane-spanning domain severely impaired the Env fusogenicity, as well as dramatically decreased the Env incorporations into MoMLV oncoretroviral and HIV-1 lentiviral vectors resulting in greatly reduced viral transductions. Collectively, our studies reveal that XMRV entry does not require a low pH or low pH-dependent host proteases, and that the cytoplasmic tail of XMRV Env critically modulates membrane fusion and cell entry. Our data also imply that additional cellular factors besides XPR1 are likely to be involved in XMRV entry.",,"['Cote, Marceline', 'Zheng, Yi-Min', 'Liu, Shan-Lu']","['Cote M', 'Zheng YM', 'Liu SL']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120327,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lentivirus/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Fusion/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Internalization', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/04/06 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/06 06:00'],"['2011/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0033734 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-00711 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e33734. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0033734.

In order to understand the role of epigenetic modulation in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we have applied MeDIP-seq to the DNA of 12 AML patients and 4 normal bone marrows. This analysis revealed leukemia-associated differentially methylated regions that included gene promoters, gene bodies, CpG islands and CpG island shores. Two genes (SPHKAP and DPP6) with significantly methylated promoters were of interest and further analysis of their expression showed them to be repressed in AML. We also demonstrated considerable cytogenetic subtype specificity in the methylomes affecting different genomic features. Significantly distinct patterns of hypomethylation of certain interspersed repeat elements were associated with cytogenetic subtypes. The methylation patterns of members of the SINE family tightly clustered all leukemic patients with an enrichment of Alu repeats with a high CpG density (P<0.0001). We were able to demonstrate significant inverse correlation between intragenic interspersed repeat sequence methylation and gene expression with SINEs showing the strongest inverse correlation (R(2) = 0.7). We conclude that the alterations in DNA methylation that accompany the development of AML affect not only the promoters, but also the non-promoter genomic features, with significant demethylation of certain interspersed repeat DNA elements being associated with AML cytogenetic subtypes.

Selected oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus pulmonarius and P. ostreatus being local [Nigeria] and exotic strains, respectively) were cultured on a novel medium of yeast extract supplemented with an ethanolic extract of Annona senegalensis, and the antileukemic potential of their metabolites was studied. METHODS: Leukemia was successfully induced in Wister rats by intravenous injection (0.2 mL) of a benzene solution every 2 days for 3 consecutive weeks. The aqueous solution of fungal metabolites (20 mg/mL) produced by submerged fermentation was orally administered (0.2 mL) before, during, and after leukemia induction. Leukemia burden was assessed by comparing the hematological parameters at baseline and after leukemia induction. The immunomodulatory potential of the metabolites was assessed by using a phagocytic assay (carbon clearance method). The ability to enhance leukopoiesis was assessed by using the total leukocyte count. RESULTS: Leukemia induction resulted in significant anemia indices and leukocytosis (P<0.05) in the experimental rats. Both metabolites equally enhanced leukopoiesis and demonstrated phagocytic actions; P. ostreatus activity was significantly higher than that of P. pulmonarius (P<0.05).

METHODS: The Korea Central Cancer Registry and the Korean Society of Hematology jointly investigated domestic incidence rates and prevalence of hematologic malignancies occurred between 1999 and 2008, and analyzed survival rates of patients who were diagnosed between 1993 and 2008. Data of hematologic malignancies from 1993 to 2008 were obtained from the Korean National Cancer Incidence Data base. The crude incidence rates, age-specific incidence rates, age-standardized incidence rates, annual percentage change of incidence, and prevalence from 1999-2008 were calculated. Survival rates for patients diagnosed in 1993-2008 were estimated. RESULTS: In 2008, a total of 8,006 cases of hematologic malignancies were occurred, which comprised 4.5% of all malignancies. In all genders, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma were most frequent diseases. In terms of age, ages between 60 and 69 were most prevalent. From 1999 to 2008, the age-standardized incidence rates increased from 10.2 to 13.7, and the annual percentage change was 3.9%. The 5-year survival rate increased from 38.2% during 1993-1995 to 55.2% during 2004-2008.

All calves received colostrum from their respective mother shortly after birth and all calves were vaccinated with Leucogen(R) 10 days after birth. Blood samples from the cows and calves were taken during the whole study period (till four weeks after calf vaccination). An ELISA test was done in the lab to define the FeLV antibody concentration. 30 % of the vaccinated cows showed a seroconversion, 13 out of 20 vaccinated cows passed the antibodies onto their calves. 11 calves of group B did not convert in comparation of only 4 of group A.

Suppression of phosphatase and a tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene expression leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been observed in many cancers including leukemia, making the PTEN gene and PI3K/Akt pathway a central target for cancer therapy. Here, we demonstrated that UA was able to inhibit growth, induce apoptosis in a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562 cells) via upregulation of PTEN gene expression, inhibit Akt kinase activity, change mitochondrial transmembrane potential and reduce the release of cytochrome c and the activity of caspases.

The decision of which of these options to choose is complex and depends on both clinical and molecular variables as well as the availability and histocompatability of donor stem cells. So far there is no clear explanation on whether the expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) relates to the prognosis of AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic significance of the MPO expression in the 140 patients with diagnosed AML treated at a single institution. RESULTS: In our study, MPO expression was associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and transplant was beneficial to overcome a negative prognostic effect of MPO-negative at diagnosis based upon the result that the DFS in patients received transplants are not significant between the MPO-positive group and MPO-negative group although DFS in all patients was different according to MPO expression.

The neoplasm cells are positive for CD4, CD56, CD43, CD45, and CD123, but negative for other lineage-specific markers. To our knowledge, this is the first report of BPDCN occurring after spontaneous remission of AML, although it has been observed that some BPDCN could shift to myeloid leukemia.

Identification of proteins whose expression or function is deregulated in sBL and play a role in its formation could facilitate development of less toxic therapies. We have previously shown that E2F1 expression is deregulated in sBL. We have now investigated the mechanisms underlying E2F1 deregulation and found that the E2F sites in its promoter fail to repress its transcriptional activity in BL cells and that the transcriptional repressor E2F4 barely interacts with these sites. We also have found that E2F4 protein levels, but not those of its mRNA, are reduced in sBL cell lines relative to immortal B-cell lines. E2F4 protein expression is also decreased in 24 of 26 sBL tumor samples from patients compared with control tissues. Our data demonstrate that enforced E2F4 expression in BL cells not only diminishes E2F1 levels, but also reduces selectively the tumorigenic properties and proliferation of BL cells, while increasing their accumulation in G(2)/M.

The latter was not attributable to transcriptional downregulation but to protein degradation mediated by jun N-terminal kinase activation, and likely by NF-kB downregulation and Noxa upregulation. CLL cells stimulated in vitro with CD40L did not increase 4HPR chemoresistance if activation was accompanied by proliferation. Intra-patient analysis confirmed that the proliferating pool of CLL cells was more sensitive to the cytotoxic action of 4HPR than the activated but resting CLL subpopulation. The different 4HPR susceptibility of the two subpopulations was associated with higher Noxa expression in proliferating CLLs. Combination experiments revealed that 4HPR strongly potentiated ABT-737 cytotoxicity, especially in proliferating CLL cells that displayed amplified chemoresistance to ABT-737 alone.

Conventional chemotherapy with DNA damaging agents is then used, alone or in combination with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our aim was to assess whether imatinib resistant K562 cells were also resistant to DNA damaging agents. After treatment with H(2)O(2) and doxorubicin, but not camptothecin, cell survival was higher in imatinib resistant cells compared to parental cells. DNA damage, measured by comet and gamma-H2AX assays, was lower in imatinib resistant cells. mRNA expression levels of 50 genes of the DNA damage response pathway showed increased expression of the base excision repair (BER) genes MBD4 and NTHL1. Knockdown of MBD4 and NTHL1 expression in resistant cells using siRNA decreased cell survival after treatment with H(2)O(2) and doxorubicin. Our results indicate that imatinib resistant cells display cross-resistance to oxidative agents, partly through up-regulation of BER genes. Expression of these genes in imatinib resistant patients was not significantly different compared to sensitive patients.

In this study, we demonstrated in a cohort of 189 patients from a CLL clinic that overall survival was lower in the sub-cohort of patients aged >/= 70 years, but causes of death were similar for all age groups, being progressive CLL, secondary malignancies and infections. As normal individuals age, the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, can increase. In our patients with CLL, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels increased with age to a greater degree than in normal individuals, and the levels correlated closely with plasma beta(2)-microglobulin and with one another. In addition, in patients >/= 70 years, IL-6 was found to be a better prognostic marker than immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IgV(H)) status. In vitro studies demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-8 could enhance the binding of CLL cells to stromal cells, suggesting that their clinical activity may be mediated through their effects on the microenvironment.

Patients face difficulties accessing healthcare, affording investigational and treatment protocols, and attending follow-up. Children routinely present with advanced local and metastatic disease and many children cannot be offered any effective treatment. Additionally, multiple comorbidities, including malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV when added to acute on chronic malnutrition, compound treatment-related toxicities. Survival rates are poor. Pediatric surgical oncology is not yet regarded as a health care priority by governments struggling to achieve their millennium goals. The patterns of childhood solid malignant tumors in Africa are discussed, and the difficulties encountered in their management are highlighted. Three pediatric surgeons from different regions of Africa reflect on their experiences and review the available literature. The overall incidence of pediatric solid malignant tumor is difficult to estimate in Africa because of lack of vital hospital statistics and national cancer registries in most of countries. The reported incidences vary between 5% and 15.5% of all malignant tumors. Throughout the continent, patterns of malignant disease vary with an obvious increase in the prevalence of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and Kaposi sarcoma in response-increased prevalence of HIV disease. In northern Africa, the most common malignant tumor is leukemia, followed by brain tumors and nephroblastoma or neuroblastoma. In sub-Saharan countries, BL is the commonest tumor followed by nephroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The overall 5-years survival varied between 5% (in Cote d'Ivoire before 2001) to 34% in Egypt and up to 70% in South Africa. In many reports, the survival rate of patients is not mentioned but is clearly very low in many sub-Saharan Africa countries (Sudan, Nigeria). Late presentation was observed for many tumors like nephroblastoma in Nigeria, 72% were stages III and IV or BL stages III and IV were observed in 40% and 30%, respectively. Africa bears a great burden of childhood cancer. Cancer is now curable in developed countries as survival rates approach 80%, but in Africa, >80% of children still die without access to adequate treatment. Sharpening the needlepoint of surgical expertise will, of itself, not compensate for the major infrastructural deficiencies, but must proceed in tandem with resource development and allow heath planners to realize that pediatric surgical oncology is a cost-effective service that can uplift regional services.",['Copyright (c) 2012.

The subpopulation of CDC resistant CLL cells was examined for levels of C3b and C5b-9 binding, and expression of complement regulatory proteins. OFA significantly increased complement activation and CDC in ALM-treated CLL cells, suggesting that combining ALM and OFA could improve clinical outcome in patients with CLL.

However, overall prognosis for the 20 to 25% of patients who relapse is poor, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers the best chance for cure. In this study, we identified significant prognostic variables by analyzing the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT in ALL patients in second complete remission (CR). METHODS: Fifty-three ALL patients (42 men, 79%) who received HSCT in second CR from August 1991 to February 2009 were included (26 sibling donor HSCTs, 49%; 42 bone marrow transplantations, 79%). Study endpoints included cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, 1-year transplant-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Cumulative incidences of acute GVHD (grade 2 or above) and chronic GVHD were 45.3% and 28.5%, respectively. The estimated 5-year DFS and OS for the cohort was 45.2+/-6.8% and 48.3+/-7%, respectively. Only donor type, i.e., sibling versus unrelated, showed significant correlation with DFS in multivariate analysis (P=0.010). The rates of relapse and 1 year TRM were 28.9+/-6.4% and 26.4+/-6.1%, respectively, and unrelated donor HSCT (P=0.002) and HLA mismatch (P=0.022) were significantly correlated with increased TRM in univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In this single institution study spanning more than 17 years, sibling donor HSCT was the only factor predicting a favorable result in multivariate analysis, possibly due to increased TRM resulting from unrelated donor HSCT.",,"['Lee, Eun-Jung', 'Han, Ji Yoon', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Lee EJ', 'Han JY', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Jeong DC', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120316,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,2012/04/05 06:00,2012/04/05 06:01,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2012.55.3.100 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2012 Mar;55(3):100-6. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2012.55.3.100.

METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive acute leukemia patients who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at Samsung Medical Center between 2005 and 2010. Patients received stem cells from MRD (n=33), URD (n=46), or UCB (n=41). RESULTS: Neutrophil and platelet recovery were significantly longer after HSCT with UCB than with MRD or URD (P<0.01 for both). In multivariate analysis using the MRD group as a reference, the URD group had a significantly higher risk of grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; relative risk [RR], 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 186.2; P=0.03) and extensive chronic GVHD (RR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.9 to 25.2; P<0.01). For all 3 donor types, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival were similar. Extensive chronic GVHD was associated with fewer relapses (RR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.6; P<0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that lower EFS was associated with advanced disease at transplantation (RR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 7.8; P<0.01) and total body irradiation (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.3; P=0.04).

Recruitment of the coactivator CBP/p300 is a crucial step in transcription, and we revealed that in addition to conserved region 3 (CR3) of FOXO3a, the C-terminal segment of CR2 (CR2C) binds CBP/p300 and contributes to transcriptional activity. CR2C and CR3 of FOXO3a interact with the KIX domain of CBP/p300 at both ""MLL"" and ""c-Myb"" binding sites simultaneously. A FOXO3a CR2C-CR3 peptide in complex with KIX exists in equilibrium between two equally populated conformational states, one of which has CR2C bound to the MLL site and CR3 bound to the c-Myb site, whereas in the other, CR2C and CR3 bind the c-Myb and MLL sites, respectively. This promiscuous interaction between FOXO3a and CBP/p300 is further supported by additional binding sites on CBP/p300, namely, the TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains. In functional studies, our structure-guided mutagenesis showed that both CR2C and CR3 are involved in the activation of certain endogenous FOXO3a target genes. Further, phosphorylation of S626, a known AMP-dependent protein kinase target in CR3, increased affinity for CBP/p300 and the phosphomimetic mutation enhanced transactivation of luciferase. These findings underscore the significance of promiscuous multivalent interactions and posttranslational modification in the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators, which may allow transcription factors to adapt to various gene-specific genomic and chromatin structures and respond to cell signals.",,"['Wang, Feng', 'Marshall, Christopher B', 'Yamamoto, Kazuo', 'Li, Guang-Yao', 'Gasmi-Seabrook, Genevieve M C', 'Okada, Hitoshi', 'Mak, Tak W', 'Ikura, Mitsuhiko']","['Wang F', 'Marshall CB', 'Yamamoto K', 'Li GY', 'Gasmi-Seabrook GM', 'Okada H', 'Mak TW', 'Ikura M']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1L7.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120402,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Calorimetry', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1119073109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1119073109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Apr 17;109(16):6078-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1119073109.

Thrombosis, bleeding, and transformation to acute leukemia reduce the overall survival of patients with myelofibrosis, a disease typified by progressive splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus, and bony pains. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant offers the only potential for cure in a minority of eligible patients, leaving a serious unmet need for improved therapies. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these diseases have led to an explosion of clinical trials evaluating novel therapies. The discovery of an activating mutation in the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) gene provided a therapeutic target to downregulate this activated signaling pathway, which influences the phenotype of these diseases. Ruxolitinib (Jakafi; Incyte) is a small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1/2 that has proved to be effective at reducing splenomegaly and ameliorating symptoms in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Based on the results of 2 pivotal randomized phase III clinical trials, ruxolitinib has become the first therapeutic to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib offers a well-tolerated oral therapeutic option for patients with myelofibrosis with symptomatic splenomegaly and debilitating disease-related symptoms, but it does not seem to be effective at eliminating the underlying hematological malignancy.",,"['Mascarenhas, John', 'Hoffman, Ronald']","['Mascarenhas J', 'Hoffman R']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tisch Cancer Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. john.mascarenhas@mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120402,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-3145 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3145 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 1;18(11):3008-14. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3145.

There are also a few studies showing that FOXO3a protected cells under stress conditions, including oxidative stress, serum deprivation, and hypoxia. It was reported that FOXO3a promoted invasion of cancer cells. Thus, the role of FOXO3a in cancer is complicated. Here, we report that FOXO3a is a positive regulator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling. We found that overexpression of FOXO3a increased and knockdown of FOXO3a repressed NF-kappaB activities. Mechanistic studies indicate that FOXO3a activated NF-kappaB via inducing expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10), an upstream regulator of IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB signaling. We found that the serum deprivation activated NF-kappaB, which was blocked by inhibition of FOXO3a. Knockdown of FOXO3a enhanced cell apoptosis under serum-free conditions, which was inhibited by overexpression of BCL10. These results suggest that FOXO3a promotes cell survival via BCL10/NF-kappaB in serum starvation. Our findings may add another layer to the complexity of the role of FOXO3a in cancer.

Here we assessed the impact of RhoH on homing, migration, and cell-contact dependent interactions of CLL cells. Rhoh(-/-) CLL cells exhibited reduced marrow homing and subsequent engraftment. In vitro migration toward the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13 and cell-cell interactions between Rhoh(-/-) CLL cells and the supporting microenvironment was reduced. In the absence of RhoH the distribution of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, a protein known to coordinate activation of the Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac, appeared less polarized in chemokine-stimulated Rhoh(-/-) CLL cells, and activation and localization of RhoA and Rac was dysregulated leading to defective integrin function. These findings in the Rhoh(-/-) CLL cells were subsequently demonstrated to closely resemble changes in GTPase activation observed in human CLL samples after in vitro and in vivo treatment with lenalidomide, an agent with known influence on microenvironment protection, and suggest that RhoH plays a critical role in prosurvival CLL cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions with this agent.",,"['Troeger, Anja', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Wood, Jenna', 'Blum, William G', 'Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Williams, David A']","['Troeger A', 'Johnson AJ', 'Wood J', 'Blum WG', 'Andritsos LA', 'Byrd JC', 'Williams DA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120403,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL13)', '0 (RhoH protein, human)', '0 (RhoH protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemokine CXCL13/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47849-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-395939 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 17;119(20):4708-18. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-395939.

Despite the apparent role of pS21 as a negative regulator of C/EBPalpha transcription activity, the mechanism by which phosphorylation tips the balance between transcriptionally competent and inhibited forms remains unresolved. In the present study, we used immuno-affinity purification combined with quantitative mass spectrometry to delineate the proteins associated with C/EBPalpha on chromatin. We identified DEK, a protein with genetic links to leukemia, as a member of the C/EBPalpha complexes, and demonstrate that this association is disrupted by S21 phosphorylation. We confirmed that DEK is recruited specifically to chromatin with C/EBPalpha to enhance GCSFR3 promoter activation. In addition, we demonstrated that genetic depletion of DEK reduces the ability of C/EBPalpha to drive the expression of granulocytic target genes in vitro and disrupts G-CSF-mediated granulocytic differentiation of fresh human BM-derived CD34(+) cells.

We recently reported that plasma levels of adiponectin, an important regulator of insulin sensitivity, are elevated following imatinib therapy in CML patients, which could account for these improved metabolic outcomes. Adiponectin is secreted exclusively from adipocytes, suggesting that imatinib modulates adiponectin levels directly, by transcriptional upregulation of adiponectin in pre-existing adipocytes, and/or indirectly, by stimulating adipogenesis. In this report, we have demonstrated that imatinib promotes adipogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which in turn secrete high-molecular-weight adiponectin. Conversely, imatinib does not stimulate adiponectin secretion from mature adipocytes. We hypothesise that inhibition of PDGFRalpha (PDGFRA) and PDGFRbeta (PDGFRB) is the mechanism by which imatinib promotes adipogenesis. Supporting this, functional blocking antibodies to PDGFR promote adipogenesis and adiponectin secretion in MSC cultures. We have shown that imatinib is a potent inhibitor of PDGF-induced PI3 kinase activation and, using a PI3 kinase p110alpha-specific inhibitor (PIK-75), we have demonstrated that suppression of this pathway recapitulates the effects of imatinib on MSC differentiation. Furthermore, using mitogens that activate the PI3 kinase pathway, or MSCs expressing constitutively activated Akt, we have shown that activation of the PI3 kinase pathway negates the pro-adipogenic effects of imatinib.

Furthermore, NF-kappaB activity depended on the integrity of mTORC2 in thymocytes. Active Akt restored NF-kappaB activation, a normal rate of proliferation, and differentiation of Rictor-deficient pre-T cells. Strikingly, mTORC2 depletion lowered CCR7 expression in thymocytes and leukemic cells, accompanied by decreased tissue invasion and delayed mortality in T-ALL driven by Notch. Collectively, these findings reveal roles for mTORC2 in promoting thymic T cell development and T-ALL and indicate that mTORC2 is crucial for Notch signaling to regulate Akt and NF-kappaB.",,"['Lee, Keunwook', 'Nam, Ki Taek', 'Cho, Sung Hoon', 'Gudapati, Prathyusha', 'Hwang, Yoonha', 'Park, Do-Sim', 'Potter, Ross', 'Chen, Jin', 'Volanakis, Emmanuel', 'Boothby, Mark']","['Lee K', 'Nam KT', 'Cho SH', 'Gudapati P', 'Hwang Y', 'Park DS', 'Potter R', 'Chen J', 'Volanakis E', 'Boothby M']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120402,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase)', '0 (Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (rictor protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase', 'Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Thymocytes/*cytology']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20111470 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20111470 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2012 Apr 9;209(4):713-28. doi: 10.1084/jem.20111470.

We also asked about referral behaviors for suspected hematologic malignancies during the prior year. A total of 134 (70.5%) PCPs responded. At first anemia presentation,only 3.8% reported referring to hematology.

Studies on RNA and protein expression of genes in DS brain have demonstrated the role of triplicated genes in several DS phenotypes. Significant changes in the expression of nontriplicated genes have also been observed. However, little information is available regarding the role of nonchromosome 21 genes in DS pathology. We have found that alpha-synuclein (SNCA), a presynaptic protein whose gene is located on chromosome 6 in the Ts65Dn mouse model for DS, is significantly reduced in the cortex and other brain regions. We hypothesize that this alteration may play a critical role in the reduced synaptic function observed in DS. We have found an increase in the level of neurosin, a key negative regulator of SNCA in Ts65Dn cortex. We have also found increased levels of protein phosphatase 2A, a negative regulator of the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for dopamine in Ts65Dn cortex. These findings reveal potential target sites for intervention in the treatment of DS pathology.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ramakrishna, Narayan', 'Meeker, Harry C', 'Patel, Satyam', 'Brown, Ted W', 'El Idrissi, Abdeslem']","['Ramakrishna N', 'Meeker HC', 'Patel S', 'Brown TW', 'El Idrissi A']","['Department Molecular Biology, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, New York 10314, USA. narayan.ramakrishna@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120331,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (alpha-Synuclein)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Kallikreins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Prss18 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kallikreins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Synaptic Transmission/*physiology', 'Young Adult', 'alpha-Synuclein/*biosynthesis']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/10/06 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2011/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.23049 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2012 Aug;90(8):1589-96. doi: 10.1002/jnr.23049.

However, all of those studies used surrogate markers of iron overload, especially serum ferritin, and most had a retrospective design. We conducted a prospective observational study in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia undergoing myeloablative HSCT. Forty-five patients who were followed for over 1 year, with serial measurements of serum iron parameters, as well as liver and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. There was no significant increase in ferritin, liver or cardiac iron content in the 12 months following HSCT. Although serum ferritin still appeared to have prognostic significance, as previously reported, pre-HSCT iron overload (as reflected in liver iron content) was not associated with increased mortality, relapse, or graft-versus-host disease. These results raise the possibility that the adverse prognostic impact of pre-HSCT hyperferritinemia may be related to factors independent of iron overload.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Armand, Philippe', 'Sainvil, Marie-Michele', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Rhodes, Joanna', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Koreth, John', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Neufeld, Ellis J', 'Kwong, Raymond Y', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Antin, Joseph H']","['Armand P', 'Sainvil MM', 'Kim HT', 'Rhodes J', 'Cutler C', 'Ho VT', 'Koreth J', 'Alyea EP', 'Neufeld EJ', 'Kwong RY', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Antin JH']","['Departments of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215, USA. parmand@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Ferritins/analysis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis', 'Iron Overload/*complications', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality/*surgery/therapy', 'Liver/chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*surgery/therapy', 'Myocardium/chemistry', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/07/26 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23188 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Jun;87(6):569-72. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23188.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with chemotherapy, the reference treatment of APL, is generally considered to produce similar results in children and adults. However, previously published childhood APL studies have generally analyzed all patients age < 18 years as a group, without further dividing according to age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared disease characteristics and outcomes of children (age </= 12 years), adolescents (13 to 18 years), and adults (> 18 years) included in two multicenter APL clinical trials (APL 93 and 2000 trials). RESULTS: Of the 833 patients age </= 60 years included in the two trials, 26 (3%), 58 (7%), and 749 (90%) were children, adolescents, and adults, respectively. Children had significantly higher baseline WBC counts (P < .001). The complete remission (CR) rate (92%, 100%, and 94.5%, respectively) and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; 28%, 20%, and 23%, respectively) did not differ between children, adolescents, and adults, whereas adolescents had significantly better overall survival (OS; 5-year OS, 93.6% v 80.4% in adults and 80.4% in children; P = .03). However, in children age </= 4 years, the 5-year CIR was 52%, compared with 17.6% in children age 5 to 12 years (P = .006), although most of the younger children who relapsed experienced durable salvage with autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: Adolescents and children age > 4 years with APL treated with ATRA and chemotherapy have outcomes at least as favorable as those of adults. Younger children seem to experience more relapses and may require reinforcement of first-line treatment.",,"['Bally, Cecile', 'Fadlallah, Jehane', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Robert, Alain', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Recher, Christian', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Idres, Nadia', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Sanz, Miguel', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Ades, Lionel']","['Bally C', 'Fadlallah J', 'Leverger G', 'Bertrand Y', 'Robert A', 'Baruchel A', 'Guerci A', 'Recher C', 'Raffoux E', 'Thomas X', 'Leblanc T', 'Idres N', 'Cassinat B', 'Vey N', 'Chomienne C', 'Dombret H', 'Sanz M', 'Fenaux P', 'Ades L']","['Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120402,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",2012/04/05 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.38.4560 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.38.4560 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 May 10;30(14):1641-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.4560.

The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic index (PI) for acute- and lymphoma-type ATL (ATL-PI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective review, data from 807 patients newly diagnosed with acute- and lymphoma-type ATL between January 2000 and May 2009 were evaluated. We randomly divided subjects into training (n = 404) and validation (n = 403) samples, and developed a PI using a multivariable fractional polynomial model. RESULTS: Median overall survival time (MST) for the 807 patients was 7.7 months. The Ann Arbor stage (I and II v III and IV), performance status (0 to 1 v 2 to 4), and three continuous variables (age, serum albumin, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor [sIL-2R]) were identified as independent prognostic factors in the training sample. Using these variables, a prognostic model was devised to identify different levels of risk. In the validation sample, MSTs were 3.6, 7.3, and 16.2 months for patients at high, intermediate, and low risk, respectively (P < .001; chi(2) = 89.7, 2 df; log-rank test). We also simplified the original ATL-PI according to dichotomizing age at 70 years, serum albumin at 3.5 g/dL, and sIL-2R at 20,000 U/mL and developed an easily calculable PI with prognostic discrimination power (P < .001; chi(2) = 74.2, 2 df; log-rank test).

We aimed to determine plasma imatinib concentration, intracellular imatinib concentration, human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1) and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) mRNA expression in bone marrow cells of CML patients in order to evaluate the potential usefulness of these measures as markers of imatinib efficacy and understand their clinical relationships. METHODS: Eighty-four CML patients receiving imatinib treatment were included in this study. Imatinib trough concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Real-time quantitative PCR with a TaqMan probe was used to assess hOCT1 and ABCB1 mRNA expression in bone marrow cells. All patients were divided into the major molecular response (MMR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) or drug-resistant groups according to their response. RESULTS: The plasma imatinib trough concentration was significantly higher in the MMR group than in the PCyR (p = 0.002) or drug-resistant groups (p = 0.011). The plasma imatinib trough concentration was also significantly higher in the CCyR group than in the PCyR group (p = 0.027). There were no significant differences between the CCyR and MMR groups with regard to the plasma imatinib trough concentration (p = 0.136). The intracellular imatinib concentration in bone marrow cells was significantly higher in the CCyR group compared to the drug-resistant or PCyR groups (p = 0.013). The hOCT1 mRNA expression in bone marrow cells was significantly higher in the CCyR group than in the drug-resistant or PCyR groups (p = 0.036). The ABCB1 mRNA expression in bone marrow cells was significantly higher in the drug-resistant group than in the CCyR or PCyR groups (p = 0.013). Plasma imatinib trough concentration was positively correlated with alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (r = 0.443, p < 0.001) or dose (r = 0.422, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical responses in CML patients are correlated with both the plasma trough concentrations and intracellular levels of imatinib.","['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

Lentiviral vectors (LV) are assumed to circumvent genotoxic events previously observed with gamma-retroviral vectors, due to their integration bias to transcription units in comparison to the gamma-retroviral preference for promoter regions and CpG islands. However, recently several studies have revealed the potential for gene activation by LV insertions. Here, we report a murine acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) triggered by insertional gene inactivation. LV integration occurred into the 8th intron of Ebf1, a major regulator of B-lymphopoiesis. Various aberrant splice variants could be detected that involved splice donor and acceptor sites of the lentiviral construct, inducing downregulation of Ebf1 full-length message. The transcriptome signature was compatible with loss of this major determinant of B-cell differentiation, with partial acquisition of myeloid markers, including Csf1r (macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor). This was accompanied by receptor phosphorylation and STAT5 activation, both most likely contributing to leukemic progression.

A 'preemptive infection hypothesis' proposes that some children with leukaemia die from infection without diagnosis of leukaemia. Various different blood abnormalities can occur in untreated leukaemia. METHODS: Logistic regression was used to compare pre-treatment blood counts among children aged 1-13 years at recruitment to national clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia during 1980-2002 (N=5601), grouped by address at diagnosis within Great Britain into quintiles of the 1991 Carstairs deprivation index. Children combining severe neutropenia (risk of serious infection) with relatively normal haemoglobin and platelet counts (lack of pallor and bleeding) were postulated to be at risk of dying from infection without leukaemia being suspected. A deficit of these children among diagnosed patients from poorer communities was predicted. RESULTS: As predicted, there was a deficit of children at risk of non-diagnosis (two-sided P(trend)=0.004; N=2009), and an excess of children with pallor (P(trend)=0.045; N=5535) and bleeding (P(trend)=0.036; N=5541), among cases from poorer communities.

After a simple, one-step protein precipitation with methanol, flumatinib, its two metabolites, and internal standard (HHGV-E) were separated on a C(18) column using an isocratic mobile phase of methanol:5mM ammonium acetate:formic acid (60:40:0.4, v/v/v). A total chromatographic run time of 4.2 min was achieved. The detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode, using the transitions of m/z 563-->m/z 463 for flumatinib, m/z 549-->m/z 463 for M1, m/z 303-->m/z 175 for M3, and m/z 529-->m/z 429 for HHGV-E.

Aberrant DNA methylation has been reported to silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes in leukemia. Overexpression of the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, a subunit of the polycomb group repressive complex 2 (PRC2), was observed to promote oncogenesis. This is due to aberrant gene silencing by the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) by EZH2. Since both these epigenetic silencing events are reversible, they are interesting targets for chemotherapeutic intervention by using an inhibitor of DNA methylation, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxcytidine (5-AZA-CdR), and 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of the EZH2. Human HL-60 and murine L1210 leukemic cells exposed in vitro to 5-AZA-CdR and DZNep in combination showed a synergistic loss of clonogenicity in a colony assay as compared to each agent alone. This positive chemotherapeutic interaction was also observed in mice with L1210 leukemia. Quantitative PCR showed that the combination also produced a remarkable synergistic activation of the tumor suppressor genes, CDKN1A and FBXO32.

Despite its preliminary character, this study was considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer to be a potential mechanistic explanation for the induction of leukemia by FA. To further evaluate the reliability of these findings, chromosome preparations from cultured myeloid progenitor cells (obtained from blood samples of five healthy subjects) were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for spontaneously occurring numerical aberrations after cultivation for 9 days. FISH analysis with probes for chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 revealed that the baseline frequency of aneuploid metaphases is similar and rather low for all three chromosomes tested. More monosomies than trisomies were measured. We also exposed myeloid progenitor cells during the whole cultivation period to FA and determined the frequency of aneuploidies after 9 days of cultivation. The results clearly indicate that FA did not induce aneuploidy under these experimental conditions. In contrast, aneuploidy was induced under these conditions by the known aneugen vincristine. Myeloid progenitor cells from healthy subjects were not particularly sensitive toward the cytotoxic action of FA. Colony forming ability in the presence of FA was not reduced to a higher degree than in cultured cell lines (A549; V79).

Standard MRD percentage is assessed as a percentage of total white blood cells (WBCs) and is therefore highly dependent on WBC count. Peripheral blood (PB) contains more than five times lower MRD percentages. Therefore, PB in BM aspirates cause dilution of the MRD cells, possibly leading to false-negative results for BM MRD. The latter is avoided when relating the fraction of malignant primitive cells, identified by aberrant marker expression [aberrant primitive cells (aPC)], to the total population of primitive cells. Such a fraction may in addition reflect an important biological parameter. METHODS: As this approach is thus independent of WBC count and the total size of the primitive compartment, we investigated the role of aPC fractions on overall and relapse-free survival (RFS) in 98 patients with AML under the age of 60. RESULTS: We show that this approach identifies MRD-negative (as defined by % of WBC) but aPC-positive (as defined by % of primitive cells) patients with poor outcome after both first and second induction cycle of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: As a result, in cases with a primitive marker present, RFS is best predicted when combining standard MRD percentage with aPC fractions.",['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Terwijn, M', 'Kelder, A', 'Snel, A N', 'Rutten, A P', 'Scholten, W J', 'Oussoren, Y J M', 'Van De Loosdrecht, A A', 'Zweegman, S', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Terwijn M', 'Kelder A', 'Snel AN', 'Rutten AP', 'Scholten WJ', 'Oussoren YJ', 'Van De Loosdrecht AA', 'Zweegman S', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Standards']",2012/04/05 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/04/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2012.01416.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2012 Aug;34(4):432-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2012.01416.x.

A similar study of childhood brain tumours (Aus-CBT) was carried out 4 years later, and this paper compares control participation and its relationship with SES in the two studies. To assess the representativeness of controls in terms of SES, the addresses of controls were linked to Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2006 Collection Districts (CDs), and hence to area-based indices of SES. Independent sample t-tests and chi-squared tests were used to compare the SES indices of CDs where Aus-CBT controls lived with those where Aus-ALL controls lived and with those of all CDs where Australian families lived.

The perspective was that of the Spanish National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A decision-analytic model, based on a randomised phase III trial, was used to predict IFI avoided, life-years saved (LYS), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; incremental cost per LYS) over patients' lifetime horizon. Data for the analyses included life expectancy, procedures, and costs associated with IFI and the drugs (in euros at November 2009 values) which were obtained from the published literature and opinions of an expert committee. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PAS) was performed. RESULTS: Posaconazole was associated with fewer IFI (0.05 versus 0.11), increased LYS (2.52 versus 2.43), and significantly lower costs excluding costs of the underlying condition (euro6,121 versus euro7,928) per patient relative to SAT. There is an 85% probability that posaconazole is a cost-saving strategy compared to SAT and a 97% probability that the ICER for posaconazole relative to SAT is below the cost per LYS threshold of euro30,000 currently accepted in Spain.

RESULTS: Of 541 samples, 136 were tested using a single color method and 405 with a three-color method. Concordance with morphology was very good (?=0.82) using the three-color method with a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies (n=387). A relatively high percentage of acute leukemia was classified as AML (23%). Of the ALL samples 83% were B-lineage ALL and 17% T- lineage ALL.

The Utah Population Database (UPDB) has provided important illumination of the familial contribution to cancer risk by cancer site. METHODS: With over 15 years of new cancer data since the previous comprehensive familial cancer analysis, we tested for excess familial clustering using an expanded Genealogical Index of Familiality (dGIF) methodology that provides for a more informative, but conservative test for the existence of a genetic contribution to familial relatedness in cancer. RESULTS: Some new cancer sites have been analyzed for the first time, having achieved sufficiently large sample size with additions to the UPDB. This new analysis has identified 6 cancer sites with significant evidence for a heritable contribution to risk, including lip, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, thyroid, lung, prostate, and melanoma.

The patient had a limited grasp of English and was used to very different cultural norms. Bridging the cultural gap as outlined by Narayanasamy in the ACCESS model (2002) enabled the author to provide the important holistic nursing care that could be easily overlooked in these situations.

Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) is a core component of the mammalian circadian clock and we have previously shown its deregulated expression in a subgroup of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using real-time RT-PCR in a cohort of 76 CLL patients and 35 normal blood donors we now demonstrate that differential CRY1 mRNA expression in high-risk (HR) CD38+/immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IgVH) unmutated patients as compared to low-risk (LR) CD38-/IgVH mutated patients can be attributed to down-modulation of CRY1 in LR CLL cases. Analysis of the DNA methylation profile of the CRY1 promoter in a subgroup of 57 patients revealed that CRY1 expression in LR CLL cells is silenced by aberrant promoter CpG island hypermethylation. The methylation pattern of the CRY1 promoter proved to have high prognostic impact in CLL where aberrant promoter methylation predicted a favourable outcome. CRY1 mRNA transcript levels did not change over time in the majority of patients where sequential samples were available for analysis. We also compared the CRY1 expression in CLL with other lymphoid malignancies and observed epigenetic silencing of CRY1 in a patient with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).,,"['Hanoun, Maher', 'Eisele, Lewin', 'Suzuki, Masako', 'Greally, John M', 'Huttmann, Andreas', 'Aydin, Semra', 'Scholtysik, Rene', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Durig, Jan']","['Hanoun M', 'Eisele L', 'Suzuki M', 'Greally JM', 'Huttmann A', 'Aydin S', 'Scholtysik R', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120328,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CRY1 protein, human)', '0 (Cryptochromes)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Circadian Clocks/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', 'Cryptochromes/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2012/04/04 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/04/04 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034347 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19236 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e34347. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034347.

As an example, oncogenic fusions of the Trithorax-related protein mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) can initiate aggressive leukemias by altering the transcriptional circuitry governing hematopoietic cell differentiation, a process that requires multiple epigenetic pathways to implement. Here we used shRNA screening to identify chromatin regulators uniquely required in a mouse model of MLL-fusion acute myeloid leukemia, which revealed a role for the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in maintenance of this disease. shRNA-mediated suppression of PRC2 subunits Eed, Suz12 or Ezh1/Ezh2 led to proliferation arrest and differentiation of leukemia cells, with a minimal impact on growth of several non-transformed hematopoietic cell lines. The requirement for PRC2 in leukemia is partly because of its role in direct transcriptional repression of genes that limit the self-renewal potential of hematopoietic cells, including Cdkn2a. In addition to implicating a role for PRC2 in the pathogenesis of MLL-fusion leukemia, our results suggest, more generally, that Trithorax and Polycomb group proteins can cooperate with one another to maintain aberrant lineage programs in cancer.",,"['Shi, J', 'Wang, E', 'Zuber, J', 'Rappaport, A', 'Taylor, M', 'Johns, C', 'Lowe, S W', 'Vakoc, C R']","['Shi J', 'Wang E', 'Zuber J', 'Rappaport A', 'Taylor M', 'Johns C', 'Lowe SW', 'Vakoc CR']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120402,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Suz12 protein, mouse)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/genetics', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Glycine/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation, Missense/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/04/04 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012110 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Feb 14;32(7):930-8. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.110.

The bone marrow microenvironment can diminish AML sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We hypothesized that inhibition of protein kinases in addition to FLT3 may be effective in overriding drug resistance in AML. We used a cell-based model mimicking stromal protection as part of an unbiased high-throughput chemical screen to identify kinase inhibitors with the potential to override microenvironment-mediated drug resistance in mutant FLT3-positive AML. Several related multi-targeted kinase inhibitors, including dasatinib, with the capability of reversing microenvironment-induced resistance to FLT3 inhibition were identified and validated. We validated synergy in vitro and demonstrated effective combination potential in vivo. In particular Janus kinase inhibitors were effective in overriding stromal protection and potentiating FLT3 inhibition in primary AML and cell lines.

We used murine pre-BI cells alongside murine and human leukemic B-cell lines to show that miR-125b expression enhances proliferation by targeting B-cell regulator of immunoglobulin heavy-chain transcription (Bright)/ARID3a, an activator of immunoglobulin heavy-chain transcription. Accordingly, this target gene was downregulated in B-ALL patients with the t(11;14)(q24;q32) translocation. Repression of Bright/ARID3a blocked differentiation and conferred a survival advantage to Ba/F3 cells under interleukin-3 starvation. In addition, overexpression of miR-125b protected pre-BI and leukemic B-cell lines from apoptosis by blockade of caspase activation by a mechanism that was independent of p53 and BAK1.

More recently, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to be the most effective single agent in this disease and has been approved for the treatment of relapsed patients both in the United States and Europe. Moreover, ATO has been included in the design of several front-line studies, with the aim to reduce therapy-related toxicity while maintaining the potential of cure. AREAS COVERED: First, this review briefly discusses the mechanisms of action and the toxicity profile of ATO. Furthermore, the reported experience on the use of ATO as single agent or in combinatorial schemes both in relapsed and in newly diagnosed patients with APL is critically reviewed. Finally, the use of this agent in special subsets of patients unfit to receive conventional chemotherapy is discussed, along with its potential role in maintenance therapy. EXPERT OPINION: While the role of ATO as single agent or in combination with ATRA is well established and recommended by the European LeukemiaNet guidelines as a first option for relapsed patients, the role of the drug in newly diagnosed patients is still uncertain and based only on evidence levels mostly originating from non-randomized trials. The results of ongoing randomized studies should better define the role of ATO in front-line therapy.",,"['Breccia, Massimo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Breccia M', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Sapienza University, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120403,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2012/04/04 06:00,2012/08/09 06:00,['2012/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2012.677436 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2012 May;13(7):1031-43. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2012.677436.

Pathway analysis methods, in which differentially expressed genes are mapped to databases of reference pathways to facilitate assessment of relative enrichment, lead investigators more effectively to biologically testable hypotheses. However, once a set of differentially expressed genes is isolated, pathway analysis approaches tend to ignore rich gene expression information and, moreover, do not exploit relationships between transcripts. In this article, we report the development of a new method in which both pathway topology and the magnitude of gene expression changes inform the scoring system, thereby providing a powerful filter in the enrichment of biologically relevant information. When four sample datasets were evaluated with this method, literature mining confirmed that those pathways germane to the physiological process under investigation were highlighted by our method relative to z-score overrepresentation calculations. Moreover, non-relevant processes were downgraded using the method described herein. The inclusion of expression and topological data in the calculation of a pathway regulation score (PRS) facilitated discrimination of key processes in real biological datasets. Specifically, by combining fold-change data for those transcripts exceeding a significance threshold, and by taking into account the potential for altered gene expression to impact upon downstream transcription, one may readily identify those pathways most relevant to pathophysiological processes.",,"['Ibrahim, Maysson Al-Haj', 'Jassim, Sabah', 'Cawthorne, Michael Anthony', 'Langlands, Kenneth']","['Ibrahim MA', 'Jassim S', 'Cawthorne MA', 'Langlands K']","['Department of Applied Computing, University of Buckingham, Buckingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120402,United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,,IM,"['Adipocytes/metabolism', '*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2012/04/04 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/04/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cmb.2011.0182 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2012 May;19(5):563-73. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2011.0182.

Imatinib, an inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has emerged as the leading compound to treat CML patients. Despite encouraging clinical results, resistance to imatinib represents a major drawback for therapy, as a substantial proportion of patients are refractory to this treatment. Recent publications have described the existence of a small cancer cell population with the potential to exhibit the phenotypic switch responsible for chemoresistance. To investigate the existence of such a chemoresistant cellular subpopulation in CML, we used a two-step approach of pulse and continuous selection by imatinib in different CML cell lines that allowed the emergence of a subpopulation of adherent cells (IM-R Adh) displaying an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype. Overexpression of several EMT markers was observed in this CML subpopulation, as well as in CD34(+) CML primary cells from patients who responded poorly to imatinib treatment. In response to imatinib, this CD44(high)/CD24(low) IM-R Adh subpopulation exhibited increased adhesion, transmigration and invasion in vitro and in vivo through specific overexpression of the alphaVbeta3 receptor. FAK/Akt pathway activation following integrin beta3 (ITGbeta3) engagement mediated the migration and invasion of IM-R Adh cells, whereas persistent activation of ERK counteracted BCR-ABL inhibition by imatinib, promoting cell adhesion-mediated resistance.",,"['Puissant, Alexandre', 'Dufies, Maeva', 'Fenouille, Nina', 'Ben Sahra, Issam', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Deckert, Marcel', 'Tichet, Melanie', 'Cheli, Yann', 'Cassuto, Jill-Patrice', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Puissant A', 'Dufies M', 'Fenouille N', 'Ben Sahra I', 'Jacquel A', 'Robert G', 'Cluzeau T', 'Deckert M', 'Tichet M', 'Cheli Y', 'Cassuto JP', 'Raynaud S', 'Legros L', 'Pasquet JM', 'Mahon FX', 'Luciano F', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U1065, Team: Cell Death, Differentiation, Inflammation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120331,United States,J Mol Cell Biol,Journal of molecular cell biology,101503669,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Integrin alphaVbeta3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mesoderm/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2012/04/03 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2012/04/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['mjs010 [pii]', '10.1093/jmcb/mjs010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Biol. 2012 Aug;4(4):207-20. doi: 10.1093/jmcb/mjs010.

The analysis of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients revealed that their absolute cell numbers were normal in the blood as well as in the bone marrow but showed a striking imbalance in the differentiation subsets, with preponderance of the effector memory population. This unusual phenotype was restored after removal of leukemic cells in patients, which reached complete remission after chemotherapy, suggesting that leukemic cells might be involved in the alteration of gammadelta T cell development in AML. Accordingly, coculture between AML cells and Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells induced selection of effector cells. In accordance with their effector memory status, in vitro proliferation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells was reduced compared with normal controls. Nevertheless, Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells efficiently killed autologous AML blasts via the perforin/granzyme pathway. The ligands for DNAM-1 were expressed by AML cells. We showed that killing of AML blasts was TCR and DNAM-1 dependent. Using a xenotransplantation murine model, we showed that Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells homed to the bone marrow in close proximity of engrafted leukemic cells and enhanced survival. These data demonstrate that Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells are endowed with the ability to interact with and eradicate AML blasts both in vitro and in a mouse model. Collectively, our data revealed that Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells have a potent antileukemic activity provided that optimal activation is achieved, such as with synthetic TCR agonists.

Literature from developing countries addressing therapeutic or laboratory practices related to MRD, is largely lacking. In a first paper from India, we describe our experience in establishing a flow cytometry-based MRD assay for precursor B lineage ALL (BCP-ALL) with emphasis on the assay standardization and cost. METHODS: Normal templates for B cell development were established in 10 control patients using CD45, CD11a, CD38, CD20, CD10, CD19, CD58, CD34, CD123, and CD22. BCP-ALL samples (n = 42) were characterized at diagnosis to identify a suitable marker for follow-up during mid (D+21) and end of induction (D+33). Both, multiparametric immunophenotyping and single marker detection of LAIP were used for data analysis. RESULTS: In 95.2% of BCP-ALL at least two informative markers could be obtained when a minimum of four cocktail combinations were used. The combination CD20, CD10, CD45, and CD19 was the most useful (71.4%) followed by combinations containing CD38 (66.7%), CD22 (57.1%), CD11a (52.4%), and CD58 (33.3%). Using our approach, 60 and 47% of patients had detectable MRD at mid and end induction time points, respectively. CONCLUSION: We have described a relatively cost effective MRD panel which is applicable to over 90% of patients. We hope that this data would encourage more centers in India and other resource constrained health delivery systems to develop MRD assays.",['Copyright (c) 2012 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Patkar, Nikhil', 'Alex, Ansu Abu', 'B, Bargavi', 'Ahmed, Rayaz', 'Abraham, Aby', 'George, Biju', 'Vishwabandya, Auro', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'Mathews, Vikram']","['Patkar N', 'Alex AA', 'B B', 'Ahmed R', 'Abraham A', 'George B', 'Vishwabandya A', 'Srivastava A', 'Mathews V']","['Department of Hematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. nvpatkar@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120329,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The in vitro anti-proliferation ability of these compounds was evaluated against hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2), breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7), and human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562). Most of synthetic compounds possessed notable anti-proliferation activity against HepG2 cells and little activity against MCF-7 cells and K562 cells. In particular, compounds 4c and 4e exhibited high anti-proliferation activity against HepG2 cells with IC(50) at about 2.0 microM. Further toxicity screening toward normal human hepatocytes indicated that some compounds had low toxicity against normal liver cells, among which 4e displayed very weak effects on QSG7701 and HL7702 cells, with IC(50) values >100 and 50 microM, respectively. Compound 4c, with the best anti-proliferation activity in amino-substituted flavones (IC(50) = 2.0 microM), was selected for further evaluation of its effects on apoptosis and the cell cycle. HepG2 cells were exposed to this compound at 10 microM, which induced nuclear disassembly and DNA fragmentation. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that the population of apoptotic cells greatly increased in the 4c-treated HepG2 cells, and the cell cycle was arrested at the G(2)/M phase.","['Copyright (c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), blast crisis progenitors are capable of adopting more primitive but deregulated stem cell features with acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This in turn promotes LSC behavior characterized by aberrant self-renewal, differentiation, and survival capacity. Multiple reports suggest that cell cycle alterations, activation of critical signaling pathways, aberrant microenvironmental cues from the hematopoietic niche, and aberrant epigenetic events and deregulation of RNA processing may facilitate the enhanced survival and malignant transformation of CML progenitors.

The aim of our study was to elucidate its role in the phenotype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disease caused by the Bcr-Abl rearranged gene. We first confirmed TET2 interaction with the Bcr-Abl protein predicted by a Fourier-based bioinformatic method. Such interaction led to TET2 cytoplasmatic compartmentalization in a complex tethered by the fusion protein tyrosine kinase (TK) and encompassing the Forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) transcription factor. We then focused the impact of TET2 loss-of-function on epigenetic transcriptional regulation of Bcl2-interacting mediator (BIM), a pro-apoptotic protein transcriptionally regulated by FoxO3a. BIM downregulation is a critical component of CML progenitor extended survival and is also involved in the disease resistance to imatinib (IM). Here we reported that TET2 release from Bcr-Abl protein following TK inhibition in response to IM triggers a chain of events including TET2 nuclear translocation, re-activation of its enzymatic function at 5mC and recruitment at the BIM promoter followed by BIM transcriptional induction. 5hmC increment following TET2 re-activation was associated with the reduction of histone H3 tri-methylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which may contribute with DNA de-methylation reported elsewhere to recast a permissive epigenetic ""landscape"" for FoxO3a transcriptional activity.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mancini, Manuela', 'Veljkovic, Nevena', 'Leo, Elisa', 'Aluigi, Michela', 'Borsi, Enrica', 'Galloni, Chiara', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra']","['Mancini M', 'Veljkovic N', 'Leo E', 'Aluigi M', 'Borsi E', 'Galloni C', 'Iacobucci I', 'Barbieri E', 'Santucci MA']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia e Scienze Oncologiche Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, University of Bologna-Medical School, Bologna, Italy. mancini_manu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/04/03 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/04/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24154 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 Aug;113(8):2765-74. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CF and PBO induced diffuse hypertrophy, while centrilobular hypertrophy was observed with PB administration. The levels of mRNA for ERalpha, AR and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) which was found to be estrogen responsive in the present study, were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. In the CF and PBO groups, ERalpha mRNA expression was reduced, and consequently, the expression of a responsive gene, LIFR, was also decreased, while PB had no effect on ER mRNA levels. AR mRNA expression decreased in all the treated groups, but reduction was persistent only in PB group. Recently, LIFR was identified as a tumor suppressor gene in human HCC. Thus, LIFR may be one of the key mediators of hepatic carcinogenesis induced by CF and PBO, but PB appears to act via different mechanisms.",,"['Fujimoto, Nariaki', 'Inoue, Kaoru', 'Yoshida, Midori', 'Nishikawa, Akiyoshi', 'Ozawa, Shogo', 'Gamou, Toshie', 'Nemoto, Kiyomitsu', 'Degawa, Masakuni']","['Fujimoto N', 'Inoue K', 'Yoshida M', 'Nishikawa A', 'Ozawa S', 'Gamou T', 'Nemoto K', 'Degawa M']","['Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. nfjm@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'HPN91K7FU3 (Clofibrate)', 'LWK91TU9AH (Piperonyl Butoxide)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD36 Antigens/genetics', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Clofibrate/toxicity', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly/chemically induced/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Phenobarbital/toxicity', 'Piperonyl Butoxide/toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Receptors, Androgen/*genetics']",2012/04/03 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/04/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jts/37.281 [pii]', '10.2131/jts.37.281 [doi]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 2012;37(2):281-6. doi: 10.2131/jts.37.281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TCR gene transfer results in competition for surface expression and inappropriate pairing between the exogenous and endogenous TCR chains, resulting in suboptimal activity and potentially harmful unpredicted antigen specificities of the resultant TCRs. We designed zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) that promoted the disruption of endogenous TCR beta- and alpha-chain genes. Lymphocytes treated with ZFNs lacked surface expression of CD3-TCR and expanded with the addition of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. After lentiviral transfer of a TCR specific for the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen, these TCR-edited cells expressed the new TCR at high levels, were easily expanded to near purity and were superior at specific antigen recognition compared to donor-matched, unedited TCR-transferred cells.

Focus was on damages related to DNA. The vitamins' chemical oxidation potencies were studied by measuring the amount of the oxidation product 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formed from the DNA nucleoside deoxyguanosine (dG) after vitamin exposure, using a high-performance liquid chromatography system with electrochemical and ultraviolet detection. To study the vitamins' ability to cause DNA damage to cultured cells, promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were exposed to vitamins, and strand breaks, alkali-labile sites and oxidative DNA lesions, i.e. formamido pyrimidine DNA glycosylase-sensitive sites, were detected using the comet assay. Vitamins A and C chemically induced oxidation of dG, alone and in synergism with iron or copper, whereas only vitamin C and copper induced DNA damage in cultured cells. Contrary, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and B12, beta-carotene, folic acid, alpha-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol or gamma-tocopherol did not induce oxidative damage to dG, while lycopene induced a weak dose-response increase.

Although a number of methods have been developed to differentiate ES cells into neuronal phenotypes such as sensory and motor neurons, the efficient generation of GABAergic interneurons from ES cells still presents an ongoing challenge. Because the main output of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is the gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter whose controlled homeostasis is required for normal brain function, the efficient generation in culture of functional interneurons may have future implications on the treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. The goal of this work was to examine the generation of GABAergic neurons from mouse ES cells by comparing an embryoid body-based methodology versus a hydrogel-based encapsulation protocol that involves the use of all-trans-retinoid acid (RA). We observed that (1) there was a 2-fold increase in neuronal differentiation in encapsulated versus non-encapsulated cells and (2) there was an increase in the specificity for interneuronal differentiation in encapsulated cells, as assessed by mRNA expression and electrophysiology approaches.

New therapeutic strategies based on the restoration of the cell death program seemed relevant. Some members of the Bcl-2 family are critical players in the defective apoptotic program in CLL cells and/or targets of apoptosis inducers in vitro. The concept of BH3 mimetics has led to the characterization of small molecules mimicking proapoptotic BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family by their ability to bind and antagonize the prosurvival members. Some putative or actual BH3 mimetics are already being tested in clinical trials with somewhat promising results. However, none of them has a high enough interaction affinity with Mcl-1, a crucial antiapoptotic factor in CLL. It has been suggested that resistance to BH3 mimetics can be overcome by using inhibitors of Mcl-1 expression. An alternative and more direct strategy is to design mimetics of the Noxa BH3 domain, which is a specific antagonistic Mcl-1 ligand. The development of such Noxa-like BH3 mimetics, capable of directly interacting with Mcl-1 and efficiently neutralizing its antiapoptotic activity, is extremely important to evaluate their impact on the clinical outcome of patients with CLL.",['2012 AACR'],"['Billard, Christian']",['Billard C'],"['Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Equipe 18, INSERM U 872; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, UMRS 872, Paris, France. christian.billard@crc.jussieu.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120330,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomimetic Materials/*pharmacology', 'Gossypol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2012/04/03 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/04/03 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-12-0015 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0015 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2012 Jun;10(6):673-6. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0015.

We report three cases of continuous haemodialysis with regional citrate anticoagulation performed in patients with severe acute liver failure, without accumulation in two cases and with a suspected beginning of accumulation in the third case. For these patients, close monitoring of the total-to-ionized calcium ratio, pH and anion gap is particularly essential to control the safety of citrate infusion.

We investigated activities of honokiol against adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). METHODS: Cell viability was assessed using colorimetric assay. Propidium iodide staining was performed to determine cell cycle phase. Apoptotic effects were evaluated by 7A6 detection and caspases activity. Expressions of cell cycle- and apoptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blot. We investigated the efficacy of honokiol in mice harboring tumors of HTLV-1-infected T-cell origin. RESULTS: Honokiol exhibited cytotoxic activity against HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. We identified two different effects of honokiol on HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines: cell cycle inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Honokiol induced G1 cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclins D1, D2, E, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and c-Myc, while apoptosis was induced via reduced expression of cIAP-2, XIAP and survivin. The induced apoptosis was also associated with activation of caspases-3 and -9. In addition, honokiol suppressed the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, STAT3, STAT5 and Akt, down-regulated JunB and JunD, and inhibited DNA binding of NF-kappaB, AP-1, STAT3 and STAT5. These effects resulted in the inactivation of survival signals including NF-kappaB, AP-1, STATs and Akt. Honokiol was highly effective against ATL in mice CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that honokiol is a systemically available, non-toxic inhibitor of ATL cell growth that should be examined for potential clinical application.

The steroidal part is aimed to serve as a biological platform enabling the alkylating moiety to approach its site of action by altering its physicochemical properties. The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate these compounds for anti-neoplastic activity. The compounds tested have as alkylators either para-NN-bis(2-chloroethyl)-aminophenyl-butyrate (CHL) or para-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)-aminophenyl-acetate (PHE) esterified with a differently modified steroidal nucleus. The eight newly synthesised compounds were compared on a molar basis with respect to their ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and to modify proliferation rate indices (PRI) in lymphocytic leukaemia P388 cells in mice in vivo. The life span of BDF1 mice inoculated with P388 leukaemia cells was also estimated (anti-leukaemic activity). The compounds that were effective in inducing cytogenetic effects in lymphocytic leukaemia cells in vivo were also effective in inducing antineoplastic effects in BDF1 mice inoculated with P388 leukaemia cells. These results suggest that the in vivo cytogenetic effects in conjunction with the antineoplastic activity of modified steroidal alkylators depend on the configuration of the whole molecule and on the appropriate combination of the alkylator with the steroidal molecule: a pronounced cytogenetic and anti-neoplastic action was demonstrated by the compounds that contain either PHE or CHL as alkylators and are esterified with either a steroidal nucleus that carries a cholesten group in the 17 position of the D-ring, or with a steroidal nucleus having an exocyclic NHCO-group in the D-ring.

By contrast, the clonogenic and repopulating potential of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was spared. Our data establish KDM1A as a key effector of the differentiation block in MLL leukemia, which may be selectively targeted to therapeutic effect.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Most preclinically and clinically investigated HDACi target classes I, II and IV, but only few are selective in inhibiting specific HDACs. Here we analyzed the in vitro antileukemic activity of three novel hydroxamate derivatives, the pan-HDAC-inhibitors ST13, ST34 and the known HDAC6 inhibitor ST80, treating leukemia cell lines HL60, Kasumi-1, NB-4, THP-1, K562, U937, Jurkat as well as primary AML blasts. In cell lines all three compounds exerted a strong growth-inhibitory effect at low micromolar concentrations. ST13 increased acetylation of H3, H4 and alpha-tubulin, while ST34 preferentially acetylated histones H3 and H4. Interestingly, ST80 preferentially induced alpha-tubulin acetylation at low micromolar doses, confirming a selective inhibition of HDAC6 by ST80 in leukemic cells. These observations were also confirmed in primary AML blasts cultured ex vivo. Growth-inhibition by ST80 was independent of pre-treatment HDAC6 protein expression and in contrast to ST13 and ST34, ST80 did not result in induction of p21/WAF. Immunofluorescence imaging confirmed that ST80 treatment both increased the abundance and resulted in unilateral local accumulation of acetylated alpha-tubulin. In conclusion, the three novel HDACi show potent antileukemic activity in myeloid cell lines and primary AML blasts at low micromolar concentrations. Preferential acetylation of alpha-tubulin implies that ST80 might exert its antileukemic effect not through histone reacetylation but rather through inhibition of HDAC6.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By investigating a population-based cohort of 337 Swedish patients with CLL, a lower (6.5%)IGHV3-21 frequency was determined relative to our previous hospital-based studies (10.1%-12.7%), yet this frequency remained higher compared to other Western CLL cohorts (2.6%-4.1%). Furthermore, we confirmed the poor outcome for patients with IGHV3-21 to be independent of mutational and stereotypy status. BACKGROUND: Scandinavian patients with CLL have shown an overrepresentation of the poor-prognostic IGHV3-21 gene. Furthermore, approximately 50% of patients with IGHV3-21 carry stereotyped B-cell receptors, which implicate antigen selection in leukemogenesis. These patients have also been reported to have shorter time to progression than patients with nonstereotyped IGHV3-21. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the IGHV3-21 frequency and the clinical impact of IGHV3-21 stereotypy, 337 newly diagnosed Swedish CLL patients from a population-based cohort were analyzed. RESULTS: Interestingly, the IGHV3-21 frequency was indeed lower (6.5%) in this indolent patient cohort than in our previous hospital-based cohort studies (10.1%-12.7%). Hence, a selection bias of more-aggressive cases rendered a higher proportion of IGHV3-21 cases in our original studies. Nevertheless, the Swedish IGHV3-21 frequency still remained higher when compared with other larger European or American studies (2.6%-4.1%). Finally, we confirmed the poor outcome for IGHV3-21 patients to be independent of mutational status and found stereotypy to have no impact on survival or time to treatment. CONCLUSION: The Swedish geographic bias in IGHV3-21 gene frequency was validated albeit at a lower frequency than previously reported. Moreover, no prognostic value could be attributed to IGHV3-21 stereotype status.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We conducted a 9-year (2001-2009) retrospective cohort study including patients submitted to HSCT at a reference center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The incidence of HAI was calculated using days of neutropenia as the denominator. Data were analyzed using EpiInfo 3.5.1. RESULTS: Over the 9-year period there were 429 neutropenic HSCT patients, with a total of 6816 days of neutropenia. Bloodstream infections (BSI) were the most frequent infection, presenting in 80 (18.6%) patients, with an incidence of 11.7 per 1000 days of neutropenia. Most bacteremia was due to Gram-negative bacteria: 43 (53.8%) cases were caused by Gram-negative species, while 33 (41.2%) were caused by Gram-positive species, and four (5%) by fungal species. Independent risk factors associated with HAI were prolonged neutropenia (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.10) and duration of fever (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.30). Risk factors associated with death in multivariate analyses were age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.43), being submitted to an allogeneic transplant (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.68-5.56), a microbiologically documented infection (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.87-4.6), invasive aspergillosis disease (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.1-4.3), and acute leukemias (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.6). CONCLUSIONS: BSI was the most frequent HAI, and there was a predominance of Gram-negative microorganisms. Independent risk factors associated with HAI were duration of neutropenia and fever, and the risk factors for a poor outcome were older age, type of transplant (allogeneic), the presence of a microbiologically documented infection, invasive aspergillosis, and acute leukemia.

METHODS: Colon cancer (HCT116, SW480), prostate cancer (PC3, LNCaP) and leukemia (K562) cells were treated with STI571 and TRAIL. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and sub-G1 appearance. Protein expression and kinase phosphorylation were determined by Western blotting. c-Abl and p73 activities were inhibited by target-specific small interfering (si)RNA. In vitro kinase assay of c-Abl was conducted using CRK as a substrate. RESULTS: We found that STI571 exerts opposite effects on the antitumor activity of TRAIL. It enhanced cytotoxicity in TRAIL-treated K562 leukemia cells and reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells, while having no effect on PC3 and LNCaP cells. In colon and prostate cancer cells, TRAIL caused c-Abl cleavage to the active form via a caspase pathway. Interestingly, JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors effectively blocked TRAIL-induced toxicity in the colon, but not in prostate cancer cells. Next, we found that STI571 could attenuate TRAIL-induced c-Abl, JNK and p38 activation in HCT116 cells. In addition, siRNA targeting knockdown of c-Abl and p73 also reduced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, rendering HCT116 cells less responsive to stress kinase activation, and masking the cytoprotective effect of STI571. CONCLUSIONS: All together we demonstrate a novel mediator role of p73 in activating the stress kinases p38 and JNK in the classical apoptotic pathway of TRAIL. TRAIL via caspase-dependent action can sequentially activate c-Abl, p73, and stress kinases, which contribute to apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Through the inhibition of c-Abl-mediated apoptotic p73 signaling, STI571 reduces the antitumor activity of TRAIL in colon cancer cells. Our results raise additional concerns when developing combination cancer therapy with TRAIL and STI571 in the future.",,"['Huang, Duen-Yi', 'Chao, Yee', 'Tai, Ming-Hui', 'Yu, Yang-Hao', 'Lin, Wan-Wan']","['Huang DY', 'Chao Y', 'Tai MH', 'Yu YH', 'Lin WW']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120330,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/03 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/04/03 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-19-35 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-19-35 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2012 Mar 30;19:35. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-19-35.,,,,,PMC3348077,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another TKI, bosutinib, inhibits with high potency numerous tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL1, Src family of kinases and MAPK, among others. Like nilotinib and dasatinib, bosutinib is a second-generation TKI that inhibits the majority of mutations associated with imatinib resistance, with the exception of T315I. In patients with CML-CP with prior intolerance or resistance to imatinib therapy, bosutinib rendered response rates similar to those observed in the same patient population treated with nilotinib or dasatinib. Preliminary results from the ongoing phase III BELA study in which bosutinib is compared in a randomized fashion to imatinib for patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP have been recently reported.

While initially developed as a potential treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a serendipitous observation led to methotrexate's use to effect the dramatic cure of a case of advanced choriocarcinoma. This prompted the exploration for the potential of methotrexate to treat other conditions involving disordered trophoblastic tissue. Methotrexate has subsequently revolutionized the treatment of two pregnancy-related conditions-gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and ectopic pregnancy.

However, the physiological and developmental roles of different PP2A complexes are very poorly understood. Here, we show that a newly characterized PP2A inhibitory protein CIP2A is co-expressed with ki-67 and with self-renewal protein PLZF in the spermatogonial progenitor cell (SPC) population in the testis. CIP2A and PLZF expression was shown also to correlate Ki-67 expression in human testicular spermatogonia. Functionally, CIP2A mutant mouse testes exhibited smaller number of PLZF-positive SPCs and reduced sperm counts. Moreover, seminiferous tubuli cells isolated from CIP2A mutant mice showed reduced expression of Plzf and other renewal genes Oct-4 and Nanog at mRNA level. However, PLZF-deficient testes did not show altered CIP2A expression. Importantly, spermatogonia-specific restoration of CIP2A expression rescued PLZF expression and sperm production defects observed in CIP2A mutant mice. Taken together, these results reveal first physiological function for an emerging human oncoprotein CIP2A, and provide insights into maintenance of PLZF-positive progenitors.

We show that oridonin interacted with glutathione and thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species, which in turn activated caspase-3 in t(8;21) cells. Moreover, oridonin bound AML1-ETO, directing the enzymatic cleavage at aspartic acid 188 via caspase-3 to generate a truncated AML1-ETO (DeltaAML1-ETO) and preventing the protein from further proteolysis. DeltaAML1-ETO interacted with AML1-ETO and interfered with the trans-regulatory functions of remaining AML1-ETO oncoprotein, thus acting as a tumor suppressor that mediates the anti-leukemia effect of oridonin.

Dendritic cells (DCs) as potent APCs play critical regulatory roles in antileukemic immune responses. In the present study, we investigated whether p15Ink4b can function as modulator of DC development. The expression of p15Ink4b is induced strongly during differentiation and activation of DCs, and its loss resulted in significant quantitative and qualitative impairments of conventional DC (cDC) development. Accordingly, ex vivo-generated BM-derived DCs from p15Ink4b-knockout mice express significantly decreased levels of the antigen-presenting (MHC II) and costimulatory (CD80 and CD86) molecules and have impaired immunostimulatory functions, such as antigen uptake and T-cell stimulation. Reexpression of p15Ink4b in progenitors restored these defects, and confirmed a positive role for p15Ink4b during cDC differentiation and maturation. Furthermore, we have shown herein that p15Ink4b expression increases phosphorylation of Erk1/Erk2 kinases, which leads to an elevated activity of the PU.1 transcription factor.

Mechanisms by which matrix stiffness regulates myofibroblast differentiation are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the intrinsic mechanisms of mechanotransduction in the regulation of matrix stiffness-induced myofibroblast differentiation. A well established polyacrylamide gel system with tunable substrate stiffness was used in this study. Megakaryoblastic leukemia factor-1 (MKL1) nuclear translocation was imaged by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. The binding of MKL1 to the alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) gene promoter was quantified by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Normal human lung fibroblasts responded to matrix stiffening with changes in actin dynamics that favor filamentous actin polymerization. Actin polymerization resulted in nuclear translocation of MKL1, a serum response factor coactivator that plays a central role in regulating the expression of fibrotic genes, including alpha-SMA, a marker for myofibroblast differentiation. Mouse lung fibroblasts deficient in Mkl1 did not respond to matrix stiffening with increased alpha-SMA expression, whereas ectopic expression of human MKL1 cDNA restored the ability of Mkl1 null lung fibroblasts to express alpha-SMA. Furthermore, matrix stiffening promoted production and activation of the small GTPase RhoA, increased Rho kinase (ROCK) activity, and enhanced fibroblast contractility. Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK abrogated stiff matrix-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization, MKL1 nuclear translocation, and myofibroblast differentiation. This study indicates that actin cytoskeletal remodeling-mediated activation of MKL1 transduces mechanical stimuli from the extracellular matrix to a fibrogenic program that promotes myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting an intrinsic mechanotransduction mechanism.",,"['Huang, Xiangwei', 'Yang, Naiheng', 'Fiore, Vincent F', 'Barker, Thomas H', 'Sun, Yi', 'Morris, Stephan W', 'Ding, Qiang', 'Thannickal, Victor J', 'Zhou, Yong']","['Huang X', 'Yang N', 'Fiore VF', 'Barker TH', 'Sun Y', 'Morris SW', 'Ding Q', 'Thannickal VJ', 'Zhou Y']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Tinsley Harrison Tower 437B, 1900 University Blvd., Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120329,United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myofibroblasts/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Trans-Activators']",2012/03/31 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['rcmb.2012-0050OC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2012-0050OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2012 Sep;47(3):340-8. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2012-0050OC.

METHODS: Levels of rhEGF released from hydrogels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cellular proliferating activity of released rhEGF was evaluated by MTT assay. Fifty-six wounded diabetic rats were randomly divided into four groups with different topical treatment daily. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by wound area measurement, histologic analysis, immunohistochemical assessment of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2, and Western blotting of EGF receptor. RESULTS: The rhEGF released from the hydrogel matrix kept its bioactivity on stimulating proliferation of the BALB/c3T3 cell line. Wound closure rates on postoperative day 14 were 75.8% in the negative control group, 82.83% in the group treated with hydrogel matrix, 85.87% in the group treated with rhEGF-containing hydrogel, and 81.18% in the group treated with rhEGF solution. Compared with hydrogel matrix, rhEGF-containing hydrogel had an additional effect on induction of EGF receptor expression (P < .05). Compared with negative controls, protein expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 was higher in the rhEGF-containing groups (P < .05). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was induced at its highest level on day 7 in the rhEGF-containing hydrogel-treated group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These data from in vitro release and diabetic animal models highlight the efficacy of hydrogels as a controlled releasing system for topical application of EGFs. The rhEGF-containing hydrogel we developed holds the merits of prolonged and sustained releasing of bioactive rhEGF and therapeutic potential in enhancing diabetic wound healing.",,"['Lao, Guojuan', 'Yan, Li', 'Yang, Chuan', 'Zhang, Liming', 'Zhang, Shaoling', 'Zhou, Yujun']","['Lao G', 'Yan L', 'Yang C', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang S', 'Zhou Y']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, The Second Affiliated Hospital, SUN Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Podiatr Med Assoc,Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association,8501423,"['0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*therapy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogels/chemistry', 'Rats', '*Recombinant Proteins', '*Wound Healing']",2012/03/31 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['102/2/89 [pii]', '10.7547/1020089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Podiatr Med Assoc. 2012 Mar-Apr;102(2):89-98. doi: 10.7547/1020089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although MGUS patients may remain stable for years, they are at increased risk of progressing to MM. A better understanding of the relevant molecular changes underlying the transition from an asymptomatic to symptomatic disease state is urgently needed. Our studies show for the first time that the CD147 molecule (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) may be having an important biological role in MM. We first demonstrate that CD147 is overexpressed in MM plasma cells (PCs) vs normal and pre-malignant PCs. Next, functional studies revealed that the natural CD147 ligand, cyclophilin B, stimulates MM cell growth. Moreover, when MM patient PCs displaying bimodal CD147 expression were separated into CD147(bright) and CD147(dim) populations and analyzed for proliferation potential, we discovered that CD147(bright) PCs displayed significantly higher levels of cell proliferation than did CD147(dim) PCs. Lastly, CD147-silencing significantly attenuated MM cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that the CD147 molecule has a key role in MM cell proliferation and may serve as an attractive target for reducing the proliferative compartment of this disease.",,"['Arendt, B K', 'Walters, D K', 'Wu, X', 'Tschumper, R C', 'Huddleston, P M', 'Henderson, K J', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Arendt BK', 'Walters DK', 'Wu X', 'Tschumper RC', 'Huddleston PM', 'Henderson KJ', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120330,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BSG protein, human)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)', '137497-17-7 (cyclophilin B)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)']",IM,"['Basigin/administration & dosage/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclophilins/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/chemistry/*pathology']",2012/03/31 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201291 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.91 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Oct;26(10):2286-96. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.91.

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) protect CLL cells from apoptosis in a contact-dependent fashion, and have been used for the identification of key pathways such as the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis. To further dissect the molecular impact of BMSC on survival and the molecular activation signature of CLL cells, we co-cultured CLL cells with different BMSC. Gene expression profiling of CLL cells revealed that the lymphoid proto-oncogene TCL1 was among the top genes upregulated in CLL cells by BMSC. TCL1 mRNA and protein upregulation by BMSC was paralleled by decreases of TCL1-interacting FOS/JUN, and confirmed by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitations, and flow cytometry. Stroma mediated increases in TCL1 were also associated with decreased levels of TCL1-regulatory micro-RNAs (miR-29b, miR-181b, miR-34b). These findings demonstrate that the microenvironment has a proactive role in the regulation of the known signaling enhancer and pro-survival molecule TCL1 in CLL.

Surgical resection in addition to antifungal therapy is an option for selected cases but often feared because of immunosuppression. METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 71 patients undergoing lung resection for pulmonary invasive fungal disease. Most patients had leukemia, 44 underwent high-dose chemotherapy, and 18 underwent stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: On the day of surgery, 44 patients were neutropenic, and 41 had a platelet count < 50 x 109/L. Forty-five nonanatomic (atypical) resections and 26 lobectomies were performed. Fungal infection was histologically proven in 53 patients. Reoperation was needed in four patients (bronchial stump dehiscence, persistent air leak, chylothorax, and seroma). Minor complications at the site of surgery occurred in 14 patients. In only two, there was an uncontrolled disseminated fungal infection. Overall, mortality at 30 days was 7% (five of 71). Long-term survival was mainly influenced by the underlying hematologic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Lung resection is a therapeutic option for hematologic patients with pulmonary fungal infection.

Two basic approaches have been used: tissue-based methods (polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization) and serologic assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, etc.). The objective of this review was to answer the question of whether infection of the male genitourinary tract may have a role in the etiology of CaP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review of the evidence that was published in the MEDLINE/PubMed database until December 2011. The search terms included ""prostate cancer,"" ""infection,"" and the explicit names of the various infectious agents. Additional studies were identified using a reference search. A total of 74 papers were included in the review, which cover the following infectious agents: human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus, BK virus, JC virus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma, trichomonas, neisseria, treponema, Propionibacterium acnes, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Despite the variable study designs and methodological approaches that were used, most of the pathogens that were studied were unlikely to be directly involved in prostate carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The role of infection in the etiology of CaP has yet to be determined despite 30 years of research efforts.

In T-cell ALL (15% of ALL), prognostic factors are ill defined. We aimed to describe the event-free survival (EFS) and analyze clinical prognostic factors in a series of pediatric T-ALL of 4 consecutive clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with T-ALL aged 1-18 years treated in 37 institutions in Spain were enrolled in 4 consecutive trials from February-1989 to November-2009. RESULTS: A total of 218 T-ALL patients out of 1,652 pediatric ALL were evaluable during the study period (SHOP/ALL-89: 35, ALL-94: 63, ALL-99: 62, ALL-2005: 58). There were 164 boys (75%). Median age (years) was 7.8 range (1.3-18.6). Median leukocytes (10(9)/L) was 78.2, range 0.8-930. Fifteen (6.8%) children had central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis. Regarding response to induction treatment, 150 (75%) patients had less than 5% blasts on day-14 bone marrow and 199 achieved complete remission at the end of induction. Overall survival (OS) at 60 months for SHOP/ALL-89, ALL-94, ALL-99 was 48 (8), 49 (6), 70 (6) %, respectively, and at 48 months for SHOP/ALL-2005 (ongoing protocol) was 74 (8) %. Median follow-up (months) was 206, 152, 74 and 17 respectively. Analysis of prognostic factors revealed no statistical differences regarding sex or age. Leukocyte count over 200x10(9)/l (P=.024), CNS infiltration at diagnosis (P<.006) and treatment response had prognostic significance (end-induction complete remission) (P=.0000), day 14-bone marrow (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: Results for the SHOP/ALL-89 and ALL-94 protocols were inferior to other contemporary protocols but there has been an improvement in survival in the 2 last trials. In line with other T-ALL series, response to treatment had the strongest prognostic impact.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Espana, S.L.

The PU.1 transcription factor is important for cellular differentiation through the control of its target genes not only in myeloid and B-lymphoid cells, but also in erythroid cells. Downregulation of PU.1 was reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies. In this study, we sought to identify the relationship between the effects of 5-azadc and PU.1. For this purpose, we employed PU.1-knockdown K562 (K562 PU.1KD) cells stably expressing PU.1 short inhibitory RNAs and PU.1-overexpressing K562 (K562 PU.1OE) cells. Therapeutic concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 muM) of 5-azadc resulted in growth arrest in the G2/M phase. Strikingly, however, K562 PU.1OE cells had significantly increased rates of G2/M and apoptotic sub-G1 phase cells. We observed the induction of cyclin B1, a regulator of the G2/M transition, after the addition of 5-azadc. This induction was abolished in K562 PU.1KD cells, but significantly induced in K562 PU.1OE cells. Further analyses revealed potent induction of hemoglobin A1 expression in K562 PU.1OE cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the PU.1 expression level is tightly related to the differentiating and apoptotic effects of 5-azadc in K562 cells.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Temozolomide has become the standard chemotherapeutic agent for malignant gliomas. The emergence of this alkylating agent with little acute toxicity or cumulative myelosuppression has led to off-label protracted chemotherapy for many patients with malignant and even low-grade infiltrative gliomas, raising concern for increased risk of t-MDS/t-AML in the few long-term survivors. On the basis of an extensive literature search, we provide a discussion of epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapy of these disorders. t-MDS/t-AML remain rare complications of chemotherapy in patients with primary brain tumors, and the vast majority of patients die of their primary neoplasm. Prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up are required to accurately assess the risk of t-MDS/t-AML; however, unless survival in the most common gliomas substantially increases, t-MDS/t-AML incidence will likely remain low in this patient population.",,"['Baehring, Joachim M', 'Marks, Peter W']","['Baehring JM', 'Marks PW']","['Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA. joachim.baehring@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120329,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced']",2012/03/31 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nos068 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/nos068 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2012 May;14(5):529-40. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/nos068.

We aimed to validate a more practical, affordable and safe method for this purpose. METHODS: We tested the expression of a receptor containing CD3zeta and 4-1BB signaling molecules (anti-CD19-BB-zeta) in human NK cells after electroporation with the corresponding mRNA using a clinical-grade electroporator. The cytotoxic capacity of the transfected NK cells was tested in vitro and in a mouse model of leukemia. RESULTS: Median anti-CD19-BB-zeta expression 24 h after electroporation was 40.3% in freshly purified (n =18) and 61.3% in expanded (n = 31) NK cells; median cell viability was 90%. NK cells expressing anti-CD19-BB-zeta secreted interferon (IFN)-gamma in response to CD19-positive target cells and had increased cytotoxicity. Receptor expression was detectable 6 h after electroporation, reaching maximum levels at 24-48 h; specific anti-CD19 cytotoxicity was observed at 96 h. Levels of expression and cytotoxicities were comparable with those achieved by retroviral transduction. A large-scale protocol was developed and applied to expanded NK cells (median NK cell number 2.5 x 10(8), n = 12). Median receptor expression after 24 h was 82.0%; NK cells transfected under these conditions exerted considerable cytotoxicity in xenograft models of B-cell leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The method described here represents a practical way to augment the cytotoxicity of NK cells against B-cell malignancies. It has the potential to be extended to other targets beyond CD19 and should facilitate the clinical use of redirected NK cells for cancer therapy.",,"['Shimasaki, Noriko', 'Fujisaki, Hiroyuki', 'Cho, Duck', 'Masselli, Marika', 'Lockey, Timothy', 'Eldridge, Paul', 'Leung, Wing', 'Campana, Dario']","['Shimasaki N', 'Fujisaki H', 'Cho D', 'Masselli M', 'Lockey T', 'Eldridge P', 'Leung W', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120329,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3 antigen, zeta chain)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Mice', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/genetics/therapeutic use']",2012/03/31 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2012.671519 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(12)70698-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2012 Aug;14(7):830-40. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2012.671519.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the serology of BBV in a longitudinal fashion in the haemodialysis-dependent population treated in the TENT of Australia from 2000 to 2009 inclusive. HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV serology on commencement of dialysis and at exit or January 2010, whichever was earlier, as well as demographic details were collected. Patients with a change in serological status had all serology reviewed. RESULTS: Four-hundred and forty patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 84.3% were Indigenous and 55.4% female, with a median age of 50 (IQR 43-59) years at the commencement of haemodialysis. Evidence of past HBV infection was documented in 42.7% and 8.9% were hepatitis B surface antigen-positive. Positive serology for HTLV was documented in 2.2%, 1.6% were hepatitis C antibody-positive and no individual was HIV-positive. Three patients had a definite change in their HBV serology over time; this equates to an absolute seroconversion risk of 0.1 per 100 person years or 0.0006 per dialysis episode.

This resistance has been associated with the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, as a BCR-ABL independent mechanism. The classic pathway studied in MDR promotion is ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family transporters expression, but other mechanisms that drive drug resistance are largely unknown. To better understand IM therapy relapse due to the rise of MDR, we compared the proteomic profiles of K562 and Lucena (K562/VCR) cells. RESULTS: The use of 2-DE coupled with a MS approach resulted in the identification of 36 differentially expressed proteins. Differential mRNA levels of leucine-rich PPR motif-containing (LRPPRC) protein, minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (MCM7) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B (MDR/TAP) member 1 (ABCB1) were capable of defining samples from CML patients as responsive or resistant to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Through the data presented in this work, we show the relevance of MDR to IM therapy. In addition, our proteomic approach identified candidate actors involved in resistance, which could lead to additional information on BCR-ABL-independent molecular mechanisms.",,"['Correa, Stephany', 'Pizzatti, Luciana', 'Du Rocher, Barbara', 'Mencalha, Andre', 'Pinto, Daniela', 'Abdelhay, Eliana']","['Correa S', 'Pizzatti L', 'Du Rocher B', 'Mencalha A', 'Pinto D', 'Abdelhay E']","['Laboratorio Celula-Tronco, Divisao de Laboratorios do CEMO, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. scorrea@biof.ufrj.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120330,England,Proteome Sci,Proteome science,101170539,,,,2012/03/31 06:00,2012/03/31 06:01,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:01 [medline]']","['1477-5956-10-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-5956-10-23 [doi]']",epublish,Proteome Sci. 2012 Mar 30;10:23. doi: 10.1186/1477-5956-10-23.,,,,,PMC3361502,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3-ITD is associated with poor clinical outcome and is an indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). METHODS: To investigate FLT3-ITD length, position, and mutational load in AML cases, we developed patient-specific quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays and correlated the results with established sensitive minimal residual disease (MRD) parameters and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In 409 patients with AML, FLT3-ITDs could be detected in 54 cases (13%). Within our cohort, patients with FLT3-ITD >/= 45 base pairs had significantly higher relapse rates (P = 0.03) and a worse overall survival (P = 0.03). Our method could be applied to 97% of FLT3-ITD-positive patients and was as sensitive as other MRD parameters such as PML-RARA , NPM1 mutations, or MLL -PTD (correlation: r = 0.63; 0.99, and 0.99, respectively). MRD negativity predicted lasting remission independent of allo-SCT (N = 7) or non-allo-SCT (N = 9). All paired diagnostic/relapsed samples showed FLT3-ITD positivity. Compared with bone marrow samples, FLT3-ITD analyses appeared to be equivalently sensitive in peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that individualized monitoring of FLT3-ITD in patients with AML may guide treatment decisions and should be evaluated for the indication for allo-SCT.",['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Schiller, Joanna', 'Praulich, Inka', 'Krings Rocha, Cristiano', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Schiller J', 'Praulich I', 'Krings Rocha C', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120509,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/03/31 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/03/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01785.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Jul;89(1):53-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01785.x.

HTLV-1 is a causative agent of Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), whereas HTLV-2, highly similar to HTLV-1, causes no known overt disease. HTLV gene products are engaged in a dynamic struggle of activating and antagonistic interactions with host cells. Investigations focused on one or a few genes have identified several human factors interacting with HTLV viral proteins. Most of the available interaction data concern the highly investigated HTLV-1 Tax protein. Identifying shared and distinct host-pathogen protein interaction profiles for these two viruses would enlighten how they exploit distinctive or common strategies to subvert cellular pathways toward disease progression. RESULTS: We employ a scalable methodology for the systematic mapping and comparison of pathogen-host protein interactions that includes stringent yeast two-hybrid screening and systematic retest, as well as two independent validations through an additional protein interaction detection method and a functional transactivation assay. The final data set contained 166 interactions between 10 viral proteins and 122 human proteins. Among the 166 interactions identified, 87 and 79 involved HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 -encoded proteins, respectively. Targets for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 proteins implicate a diverse set of cellular processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the apoptosis, different cancer pathways and the Notch signaling pathway.

In this study, we demonstrate in T-ALL cell lines and primary blasts, that engagement of alpha2beta1 integrin with its ligand collagen I (ColI), reduces doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, whereas fibronectin (Fn) had no effect. ColI but not Fn inhibited doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 and -3. ColI but not Fn also prevented doxorubicin from down-regulating the levels of the prosurvival Bcl-2 protein family member Mcl-1. The effect of ColI on Mcl-1 occurred through the inhibition of doxorubicin-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Mcl-1 knockdown experiments showed that the maintenance of Mcl-1 levels is essential for ColI-mediated T-ALL cell survival. Furthermore, activation of MAPK/ERK, but not PI3K/AKT, is required for ColI-mediated inhibition of doxorubicin-induced JNK activation and apoptosis and for ColI-mediated maintenance of Mcl-1 levels. Thus, our study identifies alpha2beta1 integrin as an important survival pathway in drug-induced apoptosis of T-ALL cells and suggests that its activation can contribute to the generation of drug resistance.",,"['Naci, Dalila', 'El Azreq, Mohammed-Amine', 'Chetoui, Nizar', 'Lauden, Laura', 'Sigaux, Francois', 'Charron, Dominique', 'Al-Daccak, Reem', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Naci D', 'El Azreq MA', 'Chetoui N', 'Lauden L', 'Sigaux F', 'Charron D', 'Al-Daccak R', 'Aoudjit F']","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, and Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, Local T1-49, Quebec G1V4G2, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, and Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, Local T1-49, Quebec G1V4G2, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, and Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, Local T1-49, Quebec G1V4G2, Canada.', ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) UMRS 940, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie Universite Paris Denis Diderot, Hopital Saint Louis, 75010 Paris, France."", ""INSERM U944, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie Universite Paris Denis Diderot, Hopital Saint Louis, 75010 Paris, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) UMRS 940, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie Universite Paris Denis Diderot, Hopital Saint Louis, 75010 Paris, France."", ""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) UMRS 940, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie Universite Paris Denis Diderot, Hopital Saint Louis, 75010 Paris, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie/Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Pavillon CHUL, and Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, Local T1-49, Quebec G1V4G2, Canada.

METHODS: We studied 523 AYAs recruited from seven population-based cancer registries, diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ cell cancer, or sarcoma in 2007-2008. Participants completed surveys a median of 11 months from diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations between unmet (information and service) needs and sociodemographic and health-related factors. RESULTS: More than half of AYAs had unmet information needs relating to their cancer returning and cancer treatments. AYAs needing services, but not receiving them, ranged from 29 % for in-home nursing to 75 % for a support group. The majority of AYAs who needed a pain management expert, physical/occupational therapist, mental health worker, or financial advice on paying for health care did not receive services. In multivariable analyses, older participants, men, participants of non-white race/ethnicity, and participants who reported less than excellent general health or fair/poor quality of care were more likely to report unmet information needs. Factors associated with both unmet service and information needs included physical health or emotional problems interfering with social activities or having >/=3 physical treatment-related symptoms.

Using GWAS data on 823 BCP-ALL cases by considering all typed SNPs simultaneously, we have calculated that 24% of the total variation in BCP-ALL risk is accounted for common genetic variation (95% confidence interval 6-42%). Our findings provide support for a polygenic basis for susceptibility to BCP-ALL and have wider implications for future searches for novel disease-causing risk variants.",,"['Enciso-Mora, V', 'Hosking, F J', 'Sheridan, E', 'Kinsey, S E', 'Lightfoot, T', 'Roman, E', 'Irving, J A E', 'Tomlinson, I P M', 'Allan, J M', 'Taylor, M', 'Greaves, M', 'Houlston, R S']","['Enciso-Mora V', 'Hosking FJ', 'Sheridan E', 'Kinsey SE', 'Lightfoot T', 'Roman E', 'Irving JA', 'Tomlinson IP', 'Allan JM', 'Taylor M', 'Greaves M', 'Houlston RS']","['Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120329,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Risk']",2012/03/30 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201289 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Oct;26(10):2212-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.89.

Gottron's papules are a particularly resistant manifestation of DM that often persist after other lesions have resolved with therapy. We examined non-Gottron's DM lesions and Gottron's papule skin biopsies for C4S, CD44 variant 7 (CD44v7), a chondroitin sulfate-binding isoform causally implicated in autoimmunity, and osteopontin (OPN), a CD44v7 ligand implicated in chronic inflammation. Gottron's papule dermis contained more C4S and CD44v7 than non-Gottron's lesions. Normal skin showed less CD44v7 over joints relative to Gottron's lesions. All DM dermis had increased OPN compared with healthy skin. Mechanically stretching cultured fibroblasts for 6 hours induced CD44v7 mRNA and protein, whereas IFN-gamma treatment induced OPN mRNA and protein. OPN alone did not induce CD44v7, but stretching dermal fibroblasts in the presence of OPN increased human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) monocyte binding, which is blunted by anti-CD44v7 blocking antibody. C4S, CD44v7, and OPN are three molecules uniquely present in Gottron's papules that contribute to inflammation individually and in association with one another. We propose that stretch-induced CD44v7 over joints, in concert with dysregulated OPN levels in the skin of DM patients, increases local inflammatory cell recruitment and contributes to the pathogenesis and resistance of Gottron's papules.",,"['Kim, Jessica S', 'Bashir, Muhammad M', 'Werth, Victoria P']","['Kim JS', 'Bashir MM', 'Werth VP']","['New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120329,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/analysis', 'Dermatomyositis/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Osteopontin/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Skin/*metabolism']",2012/03/30 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2012/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)35827-9 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2012.54 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2012 Jul;132(7):1825-32. doi: 10.1038/jid.2012.54.

METHODS: 46 patients with T-ALL were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry, and 30 cases were also subjected to karyotype analysis by R-banding technology. The clinical and biological characteristics of T-ALL patients between MyAg+ and MyAg- groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Myeloid antigen (MyAg) expression was documented in 41.3% of the 46 T-ALL cases. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 17 out of 30 (56.7%) cases. Our data showed that the median lowest white blood cell (WBC) count and lowest hemoglobin level, higher CD34 positivity, and a lower proportion of patients with splenomegaly were found to be correlated with MyAg+ T-ALL. No statistical difference was noted in the complete remission (CR) rate, relapse rate, induction death rate or total death rate among MyAg+ and MyAg- patients. In our cohort, none of the antigens tested affected the CR rate after the first induction. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that MyAg expression in patients with T-ALL was not associated with adverse presenting clinical and biological features as well as response to induction treatment. The expression of surface antigens had no impact on initial chemotherapy CR achievement.","['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells. Therefore, they represent promising cancer therapeutics that appear particularly useful in combination therapies. Although HDACi are tested in current clinical trials, the molecular mechanisms modulating the cellular responses toward HDACi are incompletely understood. To gain insight into pathways that limit HDACi efficacy in gastric cancer, we treated a panel of gastric cancer cells with the clinically relevant HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). We report that higher expression levels of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members MCL1 and BCL(XL) were detectable in cells with high inhibitory concentration 50 (IC(50)) values for SAHA. Using RNAi, we show that MCL1 and BCL(XL) lower the efficacy of SAHA. To find strategies to interfere with MCL1 and BCL(XL) expression, we investigated molecular regulation of both proteins. We show that specific siRNAs against c-MYC as well as pharmacological inhibition of this cancer-relevant transcription factor reduced MCL1 and BCL(XL) expression. Subsequently, we observed an increase in SAHA efficacy. Our data furthermore demonstrate that two different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the modulation of these factors. Whereas c-MYC controls transcription of MCL1 directly, regulation of BCL(XL) was due to c-MYC's capability to regulate the eIF4E gene, which encodes a rate-limiting factor of eukaryotic translation. Our data reveal a new molecular mechanism for how c-MYC controls cell autonomous apoptosis and provide a rationale for a concerted inhibition of HDACs and c-MYC in gastric cancer.",,"['Labisso, Wajana L', 'Wirth, Matthias', 'Stojanovic, Natasa', 'Stauber, Roland H', 'Schnieke, Angelika', 'Schmid, Roland M', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Saur, Dieter', 'Schneider, Gunter']","['Labisso WL', 'Wirth M', 'Stojanovic N', 'Stauber RH', 'Schnieke A', 'Schmid RM', 'Kramer OH', 'Saur D', 'Schneider G']","['II Medizinische Klinik, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120415,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vorinostat', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/30 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2012/03/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['20008 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.20008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 Apr 15;11(8):1593-602. doi: 10.4161/cc.20008.

Genes that rely on SRF for androgen responsiveness represent a small fraction of androgen-regulated genes, but distinguish benign from malignant prostate, correlate with aggressive disease, and are associated with biochemical recurrence. Thus, understanding the mechanism(s) by which SRF conveys androgen regulation to its target genes may provide novel opportunities to target clinically relevant androgen signaling. Here, we show that the small GTPase ras homolog family member A (RhoA) mediates androgen-responsiveness of more than half of SRF target genes. Interference with expression of RhoA, activity of the RhoA effector Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK), and actin polymerization necessary for nuclear translocation of the SRF cofactor megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL) prevented full androgen regulation of SRF target genes. Androgen treatment induced RhoA activation, increased the nuclear content of MAL, and led to MAL recruitment to the promoter of the SRF target gene FHL2. In clinical specimens RhoA expression was higher in PCa cells than benign prostate cells, and elevated RhoA expression levels were associated with aggressive disease features and decreased disease-free survival after radical prostatectomy. Overexpression of RhoA markedly increased the androgen-responsiveness of select SRF target genes, in a manner that depends on its GTPase activity. The use of isogenic cell lines and a xenograft model that mimics the transition from androgen-stimulated to castration-recurrent PCa indicated that RhoA levels are not altered during disease progression, suggesting that RhoA expression levels in the primary tumor determine disease aggressiveness. Androgen-responsiveness of SRF target genes in castration-recurrent PCa cells continued to rely on AR, RhoA, SRF, and MAL and the presence of intact SRF binding sites. Silencing of RhoA, use of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 inhibitors, or an inhibitor of SRF-MAL interaction attenuated (androgen-regulated) cell viability and blunted PCa cell migration.

Moreover, the association or the evolution to an acute leukaemia entity that still expresses CD4 and CD56 markers is almost systematic. This new described entity of 'CD4(+) /CD56(+) leukaemia' or 'leukaemia of plasmacytoid dendritic cell lineage' has a poor prognostic and may lead to include haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment strategy as early as possible. REPORT OF CASES: We report here four cases presenting with skin lesions and haematological signs. One of the patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, with a relapse-free survival of 40 months. We discuss the diagnosis features as well as the treatment options. CONCLUSION: A collaborative work between dermatologists and onco-haematologists is essential to give patients the best chance of complete and long-term response.","['(c) 2012 The Author.

The Tax protein of BLV is a transcriptional activator of viral replication and a key contributor to oncogenic potential. We previously identified interesting mutant forms of Tax with elevated (TaxD247G) or reduced (TaxS240P) transactivation effects on BLV replication and propagation. However, the effects of these mutations on functions other than transcriptional activation are unknown. In this study, to identify genes that play a role in the cascade of signal events regulated by wild-type and mutant Tax proteins, we used a large-scale host cell gene-profiling approach. RESULTS: Using a microarray containing approximately 18,400 human mRNA transcripts, we found several alterations after the expression of Tax proteins in genes involved in many cellular functions such as transcription, signal transduction, cell growth, apoptosis, stress response, and immune response, indicating that Tax protein has multiple biological effects on various cellular environments. We also found that TaxD247G strongly regulated more genes involved in transcription, signal transduction, and cell growth functions, contrary to TaxS240P, which regulated fewer genes. In addition, the expression of genes related to stress response significantly increased in the presence of TaxS240P as compared to wild-type Tax and TaxD247G. By contrast, the largest group of downregulated genes was related to immune response, and the majority of these genes belonged to the interferon family. However, no significant difference in the expression level of downregulated genes was observed among the Tax proteins. Finally, the expression of important cellular factors obtained from the human microarray results were validated at the RNA and protein levels by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively, after transfecting Tax proteins into bovine cells and human HeLa cells. CONCLUSION: A comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant Tax proteins indicates that Tax protein exerts a significant impact on cellular functions as diverse as transcription, signal transduction, cell growth, stress response and immune response. Importantly, our study is the first report that shows the extent to which BLV Tax regulates the innate immune response.",,"['Arainga, Mariluz', 'Takeda, Eri', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Arainga M', 'Takeda E', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120328,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/03/30 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/03/30 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-13-121 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-13-121 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2012 Mar 28;13:121. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-121.,,,,,PMC3441221,,['GEO/GSE35823'],,,,,,,,,,

In pregnancy, there is a necessary early preimplantation inflammatory stage followed by a postimplantation anti-inflammatory stage. Thus, there is a biphasic 'immune response' observed during the course of pregnancy. We provide the evidence that capacitation of sperm induced the expression of a2 isoform of V-ATPase (ATP6V0A2 referred to as a2V), leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), Il1b, and Tnf in the sperm. Capacitated sperm also released cleaved N-terminal domain of a2V-ATPase (a2NTD), which upregulates the gene expression of Lif, Il1b, Tnf, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Ccl2 (Mcp1)) in the uterus. Unfertilized eggs had low a2V expression, but after fertilization, the expression of a2V increased in zygotes. This increased level of a2V expression was maintained in preimplantation embryos. Seminal plasma was necessary for upregulation of a2V expression in preimplantation embryos, as mating with seminal vesicle-deficient males failed to elicit an increase in a2V expression in preimplantation embryos. The infiltration of macrophages into the uterus was significantly increased after insemination of both sperm and seminal plasma during the preimplantation period of pregnancy. This dynamic infiltration into the uterus corresponded with the uterine a2V expression through the induction of Ccl2 expression. Furthermore, the polarization ratio of M1:M2 (pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory) macrophages in the uterus fluctuated from a ratio of 1.60 (day 1) to 1.45 (day 4) when female mice were inseminated with both sperm and seminal plasma. These data provide evidence that exposure to semen may initiate an inflammatory milieu by inducing a2V and cytokine/chemokine expression, which triggers the influx of macrophages into the preimplantation uterus during the onset of pregnancy and ultimately leads to successful pregnancy outcome.",,"['Jaiswal, Mukesh K', 'Mallers, Timothy M', 'Larsen, Benjamin', 'Kwak-Kim, Joanne', 'Chaouat, Gerard', 'Gilman-Sachs, Alice', 'Beaman, Kenneth D']","['Jaiswal MK', 'Mallers TM', 'Larsen B', 'Kwak-Kim J', 'Chaouat G', 'Gilman-Sachs A', 'Beaman KD']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, Illinois 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120327,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Atp6v0a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*enzymology/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', '*Fertilization', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Inflammation/*enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Insemination, Artificial', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligation', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pregnancy', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Seminal Vesicles/surgery', '*Sperm Capacitation', 'Spermatozoa/*enzymology/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uterus/*enzymology/immunology', 'Vas Deferens/surgery', 'Vasectomy']",2012/03/29 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/03/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-12-0036 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-12-0036 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2012 May;143(5):713-25. doi: 10.1530/REP-12-0036.

Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is highly associated with inflammatory process and apoptosis and is worth investigating its role when cells were exposed to trichothecenes. The results showed that DON and T-2 upregulated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, JAK1-2, STAT1-3, and suppressors of cytokine signaling members and activated the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 with a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells. AG490 and Stattic, the specific inhibitors of JAK/STAT pathway, blocked the STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased the gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines induced by trichothecenes. Interestingly, the time when the mRNA levels of STAT1 and STAT3 were significantly upregulated was at 12 h, which was much later than the time when mitogen-activated protein kinase was activated, indicating that STATs might be the downstream targets of the trichothecenes. With the intervention of AG490 and Stattic, DON and T-2 toxin induced apoptosis in a strengthened way, with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the decrease ratios of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL)/Bax.

We sought to determine the risk of developing SIC before and after other primary malignancies (PM) and the prognosis of patients with SIC, with and without another PM. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify patients diagnosed with SICs between 1973 and 2007. Multiple primary-standardized incidence ratios were calculated as an approximation of relative risk (RR) to explore the association of SICs with metachronous malignancies. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional-hazard models. Among 8331 patients with SICs, 2424 (29%) had another PM at some time. The most common sites were prostate (26.2%), breast (14.3%), colon (9.1%), lung/bronchus (6.3%), and bladder (5.3%). Overall, 67% of patients had a PM diagnosed before SIC (pre-SIC), 33% after SIC (post-SIC), and 8% had a PM both before and after SIC. Among the pre-SIC group, the risk of future SIC was increased after cancers of the small bowel (RR 11.86 (95% CI: 6.13-20.72)), esophagus (4.05 (1.10-10.36)), colon (1.39 (1.05-1.81)), kidney (1.93 (1.12-3.09)), prostate (1.38 (1.17-1.62)), and leukemia (2.15 (1.18-3.61)). Among the post-SIC group, there was an increased risk of future PM of the small bowel (8.78 (4.54-15.34)), liver (2.49 (1.08-4.91)), prostate (1.25 (1.0-1.53)), and thyroid (2.73 (1.10-5.62)). Compared to patients with only SIC, those with a PM pre-SIC had worse mean survival (57.9 vs 40.9 months, HR 1.55 (1.42-1.69), P<0.001). In conclusion, almost one-third of patients with SICs have an associated metachronous primary tumor. When these primaries occur prior to (but not after) the SIC diagnosis, the prognosis is worse than with an initial SIC. The type of malignancies associated with SICs may guide future screening efforts.",,"['Amin, Sunil', 'Warner, Richard R P', 'Itzkowitz, Steven H', 'Kim, Michelle Kang']","['Amin S', 'Warner RR', 'Itzkowitz SH', 'Kim MK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, 5 East 98th Street, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120524,England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoid Tumor/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/29 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/03/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ERC-11-0392 [pii]', '10.1530/ERC-11-0392 [doi]']",epublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2012 May 24;19(3):381-7. doi: 10.1530/ERC-11-0392.

We evaluated next-generation sequencing (NGS) for MRD assessment in AML patients (n = 80 samples). The ability of NGS technologies to generate thousands of clonal sequences makes it possible to determine the allelic ratio of sequence variants. Using NGS, we were able to determine the allelic ratio of different FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) clones within one patient sample, in addition to resolution of FLT3-ITD insertion site, length, and sequence in a single analysis. Furthermore, NGS allowed us to study emergence of clonal dominance. Parallel assessment of MRD by NGS and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in NPM1 mutated patients was concordant in 95% of analyzed samples (n = 38). The frequency of mutated alleles was linearly quantified by NGS. As NGS sensitivity is scalable depending on sequence coverage, it reflects a highly flexible and reliable tool to assess MRD in leukemia patients.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Thol, Felicitas', 'Kolking, Britta', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Reinhardt, Katarina', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Brugman, Martijn H', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Suerbaum, Sebastian', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Thol F', 'Kolking B', 'Damm F', 'Reinhardt K', 'Klusmann JH', 'Reinhardt D', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Brugman MH', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Suerbaum S', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Heuser M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120327,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/03/29 06:00,2012/09/01 06:00,['2012/03/29 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.21955 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2012 Jul;51(7):689-95. doi: 10.1002/gcc.21955.

We found that according to Southern blot hybridization analytic features, 28 patients with SM ATL could be divided into 3 groups consisting of 16 (57.4%) patients with a monoclonal band, 6 (21.4%) with oligoclonal bands and the remaining 6 with smears. Although no clinical differences were observed among the 3 SM subtypes, HTLV-1-infected CD4 T-cell counts increased in order of poly-, oligo- and monoclonal subtypes. This trend began in the carrier stage and also was observed in PVL, CD25 and CCR4, indicating that a clone consisting of leukemic phenotypic cells was continuously growing. Moreover, the antigen modulation rates of CD26 and CD7 and the increasing rate of CD25 and CCR4 cells were closely correlated to growing clonal size, indicating that these markers had the possibility to predict a monoclonal band. In particular, CD26 or the ratio of CD26/CD25 had a validity differential for leukemic nature and predictive detection of clonal band.

Hence, the reactivation of apoptotic processes is likely to be a pertinent strategy for circumventing this resistance. Proteins from the Bcl-2 family are critical elements in defective apoptosis. Some compounds induce the apoptosis of CLL cells ex vivo by downregulation of prosurvival members of this family (for example, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), whereas others act by upregulation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology (BH) 3-only members (for example, Noxa and Bim). The concept of BH3 mimetics was prompted by the fact that BH3-only proteins are specific antagonistic ligands of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members. This led to the design of small molecules capable of inhibiting the activity of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells in vitro and antileukemic effects in animal models. Several putative or actual BH3 mimetics are currently being trialed in the clinic. Two novel BH3 mimetics that can specifically bind to and antagonize Mcl-1 (a crucial antiapoptotic factor in CLL) have recently been discovered.

Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia in one or more lineages, ineffective hematopoiesis, and potential precursors of acute leukemia. One proposed pathogenesis of myelodysplasia is autoantibodies that directly reject against hematopoietic cells, but this situation is rare in thymoma. Herein, we report a thymoma patient with unique paraneoplastic syndromes who developed myelodysplasia prior to Good's syndrome.

The PBSC donation initially applied only to related donors; later, due to the safety of the procedure, it was extended to unrelated donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We have retrospectively collected data regarding mobilization, collection, and short- and long-term follow-up of 190 consecutive donors, 174 related and 16 unrelated. All donors followed a standard protocol for mobilization and underwent at least one PBSC collection. Follow-up in related donors was performed every 4 months in the first year and then annually, with no time limits, while unrelated donors were monitored for 10 years. RESULTS: All 190 donors completed the established mobilization protocol. The mobilizing capacity was significantly greater in males and in donors less than 60 years old. No case of major toxicity by granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor was found, nor thromboembolic events. The total dose of CD34+/recipient (median 5.8x10(6)/kg recipient/body weight) was statistically correlated with age, CD34+ before and after mobilization, and collection efficiency. Compliance to follow-up was 66%, with a significant difference between related and unrelated (63% vs. 100%, p=0.03). During follow-up no significant abnormalities in hematologic variables or hematologic malignancies were reported.

Isolated cases of precapillary PH have been reported in patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was designed to describe incident cases of dasatinib-associated PH reported in the French PH registry. From the approval of dasatinib (November 2006) to September 30, 2010, 9 incident cases treated by dasatinib at the time of PH diagnosis were identified. At diagnosis, patients had moderate to severe precapillary PH with functional and hemodynamic impairment. No other incident PH cases were exposed to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors at the time of PH diagnosis. Clinical, functional, or hemodynamic improvements were observed within 4 months of dasatinib discontinuation in all but 1 patient. Three patients required PH treatment with endothelin receptor antagonist (n=2) or calcium channel blocker (n=1). After a median follow-up of 9 months (min-max 3-36), the majority of patients did not demonstrate complete clinical and hemodynamic recovery, and no patients reached a normal value of mean pulmonary artery pressure (</=20 mm Hg). Two patients (22%) died at follow-up (1 of unexplained sudden death and 1 of cardiac failure in the context of septicemia, respectively, 8 and 12 months after dasatinib withdrawal). The lowest estimate of incident PH occurring in patients exposed to dasatinib in France was 0.45%. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib may induce severe precapillary PH fulfilling the criteria of pulmonary arterial hypertension, thus suggesting a direct and specific effect of dasatinib on pulmonary vessels.

Thus, from the standpoint of enhancing and improving cancer therapy, a better understanding of the molecular machinery involved in chemotherapy-related senescence is paramount. We show for the first time that Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family member, plays an important role in preventing chemotherapy-induced senescence (CIS). Overexpression of Mcl-1 in p53(+) cell lines inhibits CIS. Conversely, downregulation of Mcl-1 makes cells sensitive to CIS. Surprisingly, downregulation of Mcl-1 in p53(-) cells restored CIS to similar levels as p53(+) cells. In all cases where senescence can be induced, we observed increased p21 expression. Moreover, we show that the domain of Mcl-1 responsible for its antisenescent effects is distinct from that known to confer its antiapoptotic qualities. In vivo we observe that downregulation of Mcl-1 can almost retard tumor growth regardless of p53 status, while overexpression of Mcl-1 in p53(+) cells conferred resistance to CIS and promoted tumor outgrowth. In summary, our data reveal that Mcl-1 can inhibit CIS in both a p53-dependent and -independent manner in vitro and in vivo and that this Mcl-1-mediated inhibition can enhance tumor growth in vivo.",,"['Bolesta, Elzbieta', 'Pfannenstiel, Lukas W', 'Demelash, Abeba', 'Lesniewski, Mathew L', 'Tobin, Megan', 'Schlanger, Simon E', 'Nallar, Shreeram C', 'Papadimitriou, John C', 'Kalvakolanu, Dhan V', 'Gastman, Brian R']","['Bolesta E', 'Pfannenstiel LW', 'Demelash A', 'Lesniewski ML', 'Tobin M', 'Schlanger SE', 'Nallar SC', 'Papadimitriou JC', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Gastman BR']","['Department of Surgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120326,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics']",2012/03/28 06:00,2013/07/06 06:00,['2012/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.06214-11 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.06214-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2012 May;32(10):1879-92. doi: 10.1128/MCB.06214-11.

This study demonstrates that retroviral-mediated miR-17-92 overexpression promotes expansion of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors in mice. Cell lines derived from these miR-17-92-overexpressing mice are capable of myeloid and lymphoid lineage differentiation, and recapitulate the normal lymphoid phenotype when transplanted to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice. However, overexpression of individual miRNAs from this locus, miR-19a or miR-92a, results in B-cell hyperplasia and erythroleukemia, respectively. Coexpression of another member of this cluster miR-17, with miR-92a, abrogates miR-92a-induced erythroleukemogenesis. Accordingly, we identified several novel miR-92a and miR-17 target genes regulating erythroid survival and proliferation, including p53. Expression of this critical target results in marked growth inhibition of miR-92a erythroleukemic cells. In both murine and human leukemias, p53 inactivation contributed to the selective overexpression of oncogenic miR-92a and miR-19a, and down-regulation of tumor-suppressive miR-17. This miR-17-92 expression signature was also detected in p53- B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients displaying an aggressive clinical phenotype. These results revealed that imbalanced miR-17-92 expression, also mediated by p53, directly transforms the hematopoietic compartment. Thus examination of such miRNA expression signatures should aid in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers displaying miR-17-92 gene amplification.",,"['Li, Yanmei', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico, Laura M', 'Li, You-Jun', 'Egan, Sean E', 'Spaner, David', 'Hough, Margaret R', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Li Y', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico LM', 'Li YJ', 'Egan SE', 'Spaner D', 'Hough MR', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, and Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120326,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'RNA, Long Noncoding']",2012/03/28 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47888-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-378687 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 10;119(19):4486-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-378687.

We now find that Runx1 gene deletion increases marrow monocyte while reducing granulocyte progenitors and that exogenous RUNX1 rescues granulopoiesis. Deletion of Runx1 reduces Cebpa mRNA in lineage-negative marrow cells and in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors or common myeloid progenitors. Pu.1 mRNA is also decreased, but to a lesser extent. We also transduced marrow with dominant-inhibitory RUNX1a. As with Runx1 gene deletion, RUNX1a expands lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ and myeloid cells, increased monocyte CFUs relative to granulocyte CFUs, and reduced Cebpa mRNA. Runx1 binds a conserved site in the Cebpa promoter and binds 4 sites in a conserved 450-bp region located at +37 kb; mutation of the enhancer sites reduces activity 6-fold in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. Endogenous Runx1 binds the promoter and putative +37 kb enhancer as assessed by ChIP, and RUNX1-ER rapidly induces Cebpa mRNA in these cells, even in cycloheximide, consistent with direct gene regulation. The +37 kb region contains strong H3K4me1 histone modification and p300-binding, as often seen with enhancers.

METHODS: A total of 1041 women diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 40 years responded to a retrospective survey on demographic information and reproductive health history. Five cancer types were included: leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. Nine hundred eighteen women reported treatment with potential to affect fertility (chemotherapy, pelvic radiation, pelvic surgery, or bone marrow transplant). Student t test, linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression were used where appropriate to determine the relation between sociodemographic characteristics and the odds of using fertility preservation services. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of women were counseled on the risk of cancer treatment to fertility by the oncology team. Overall, 4% of women pursued fertility preservation. In multivariate analysis, women who had not attained a bachelor's degree (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.9) were less likely to be counseled. Trends also suggested possible disparities in access to fertility preservation with age older than 35 years (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-1.4) or previous children (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1) at diagnosis. Disparities in access to fertility preservation based on ethnicity and sexual orientation were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic health disparities likely affect access to fertility preservation services.

The major role of an elevated oxidative stress for the efficacy of molecular targeted drugs is under investigation. Menadione is considered an attractive model for the study of oxidative stress, which can induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cell lines. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) via its receptors not only promotes cell survival but also reverses apoptosis and promotes cancer progression. Here, we present evidence for the biological role of PGE(2) as a protective agent of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in monocytic cells. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with PGE(2) markedly ameliorated the menadione-induced apoptosis and inhibited the degradation of PARP and lamin B. The EP(2) receptor antagonist AH6809 abrogated the inhibitory effect of PGE(2), suggesting the role of the EP(2)/cAMP system. The PKA inhibitor H89 also reversed apoptosis and decreased the PKA activity that was elevated 10-fold by PGE(2). The treatment of HL-60 cells with NAC or zinc chloride showed a similar protective effect as with PGE(2) on menadione-treated cells.

Granulosa cells in particular have been demonstrated to play a major role in deciding the fate of follicles, serving molecules that are essential for follicular growth and maintenance as well as killing themselves by an apoptotic process that results in follicular atresia. In this review, we discuss the factors that govern follicular growth and atresia, with a special focus on their regulation by granulosa cells. First, ovarian folliculogenesis in adult life is outlined.

We have studied endocytosis of galectin-3 as one important step relevant for its function, and compared it between variants of a macrophage like cell line, and non-macrophage cells. METHODS: Endocytosis of galectin-3 was observed by fluorescence microscopy and measured by flow cytometry. The endocytosis mechanism was analysed using galectin-3 mutants, galectin-3 inhibitors and endocytic pathways inhibitors in the human leukaemia THP-1 cell line differentiated into naive (M0), classical (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) macrophage like cells, and the non-macrophage cell lines HFL-1 fibroblasts and SKBR3 breast carcinoma. RESULTS: Galectin-3 endocytosis in non-macrophage cells and M2 cells was blocked by lactose and a potent galectin-3 inhibitor TD139, and also by the R186S mutation in the galectin-3 carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). In M1 cells galectin-3 endocytosis could be inhibited only by chlorpromazine and by interference with the non-CRD N-terminal part of galectin-3. In all the cell types galectin-3 entered early endosomes within 5-10 min, to be subsequently targeted mainly to non-degradative vesicles, where it remained even after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 endocytosis in M1 cells is receptor mediated and carbohydrate independent, while in M2 cells it is CRD mediated, although the non-CRD galectin-3 domain is also involved. General significance The demonstration that galectin-3 endocytosis in M1 macrophages is carbohydrate independent and different from M2 macrophages and non-macrophage cells, suggests novel, immunologically significant interactions between phagocytic cells, galectin-3 and its ligands.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In non-clonal states, such as allergic and inflammatory conditions, cell-to-cell contact and the pleiotropic actions of multiple cytokines and chemokines, derived from local tissues or mast cells themselves, foster the co-recruitment of these cells to the same geographic cellular niche. While eosinophils and mast cells serve critical roles as part of the host immune response and in maintenance of normal homeostasis, these cell types can undergo neoplastic transformation due to the development of clonal molecular abnormalities that arise in early hematopoietic progenitors.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the down-regulation of WT1 by curcumin is not completely delineated. The purpose of this present study is to identify a new miRNA-mediated mechanism which plays an important role in the anti-proliferation effects of curcumin in leukemic cells. METHODS: K562 and HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of curcumin for 24 and 48 hours, the level of miR-15a/16-1 and WT1 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. WT1 expression and cell proliferation were detected by Western blotting and CCK-8, after curcumin treated-K562 and HL-60 cells were transfected with anti-miR-15a/16-1 oligonucleotides. RESULTS: We found that pure curcumin upregulated the expression of miR-15a/16-1 and downregulated the expression of WT1 in leukemic cells and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Overexpression of miR-15a/16-1 deduced the protein level of WT1 in leukemic cells, but downregulation of WT1 by siRNA-WT1 could not increase the expression of miR-15a/16-1 in leukemic cells. These results reveal that curcumin induced-upregulation of miR-15a/16-1 is an early event upstream to downregulation of WT1. Furthermore, anti-miR-15a/16-1 oligonucleotides (AMO) partly reversed the downregulation of WT1 induced by pure curcumin in leukemic cells and AMO promoted the growth of curcumin treated-K562 and HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Thus, these data suggest for the first time that pure curcumin downregulated the expression of WT1 partly by upregulating the expression of miR-15a/16-1 in leukemic cells. miR-15a/16-1 mediated WT1 downregulation plays an important role in the anti-proliferation effect of curcumin in leukemic cells.",,"['Gao, Shen-meng', 'Yang, Jun-jun', 'Chen, Chi-qi', 'Chen, Jun-jie', 'Ye, Li-ping', 'Wang, Lu-yao', 'Wu, Jian-bo', 'Xing, Chong-yun', 'Yu, Kang']","['Gao SM', 'Yang JJ', 'Chen CQ', 'Chen JJ', 'Ye LP', 'Wang LY', 'Wu JB', 'Xing CY', 'Yu K']","['Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, 2 FuXue Road, Wenzhou 325000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120327,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2012/03/28 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/03/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-31-27 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-31-27 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Mar 27;31:27. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-31-27.,,,,,PMC3325897,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on BTK-dependent pathways that are likely to be involved in maintaining the malignant phenotype in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Survival of various B-cell malignancies requires BTK-dependent signals from the B-cell antigen receptor.

Using K562 cells, we demonstrated that there was a dose- and time-dependent increase in 8-amino-ATP accompanied by a > 95% decline in the endogenous ATP pool. In parallel, 8-amino-Ado inhibited RNA synthesis and resulted in a depletion of BCR-ABL transcript. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL and ABL protein levels were also decreased.

However, to combat acquired resistance to imatinib, an alternative approach is to decrease the expression of the addicted gene to efficiently kill resistant malignant hematologic cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the strategy of shutting down the transcription and expression of FIP1-like-1 (FIP1L1)-PDGFRalpha and Bcr-Abl with SNS-032, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and CDK9 in phase I clinical trials. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of SNS-032 on PDGFRalpha and Bcr-Abl signaling pathways, apoptosis, and cell cycling were analyzed in TKI-resistant cells of HES and CML. The in vivo antitumor activity of SNS-032 was assessed with xenografted BaF3-T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and KBM5-T315I Bcr-Abl cells in nude mouse models. RESULTS: SNS-032 inhibited the phosphorylation on Ser5 and Ser2 of RNA polymerase II. SNS-032 decreased both the mRNA and protein levels of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and Bcr-Abl and inhibited the proliferation of malignant cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha or Bcr-Abl. It also decreased the phosphorylation of downstream molecules. It induced apoptosis by triggering both the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This CDK7/9 inhibitor potently inhibits FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-positive HES cells and Bcr-Abl-positive CML cells regardless of their sensitivity to imatinib.

We analyzed the cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, DNA damage and alteration of cell surface and cell organelle ultrastructure after K562 cells were exposed to paclitaxel in the presence or absence of 8.8 mT SMF. The results showed that in the presence of SMF, the efficient concentration of paclitaxel on K562 cells was decreased from 50 to 10 ng/ml. Cell cycle analysis indicated that K562 cells treated with SMF plus paclitaxel were arrested at the G2 phase, which was mainly induced by paclitaxel. Through comet assay, we found that the cell cycle arrest effect of paclitaxel with or without SMF on K562 cells was correlated with DNA damage. The results of atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observation showed that the cell ultrastructure was altered in the group treated with the combination of SMF and paclitaxel, holes and protuberances were observed, and vacuoles in cytoplasm were augmented. Our data indicated that the potency of the combination of SMF and paclitaxel was greater than that of SMF or paclitaxel alone on K562 cells, and these effects were correlated with DNA damage induced by SMF and paclitaxel.

Owing to the fact that rodents are not the natural permissive hosts for lentiviral infection, development of small animal models for studying virus infection has used strategies that circumvent the steps of viral entry and infection. Such strategies involve overexpression of toxic viral proteins, SCID mice engrafted with the human PBLs or macrophages, and EcoHIV chimeric virus wherein the gp120 of HIV-1 was replaced with the gp80 of the ecotropic murine leukemia virus. Additional strategy that is often used by investigators to study the toxic effect of viral proteins involves direct stereotactic injection of the viral protein(s) into specific brain regions. The present report is a compilation of the applications of direct administration of Tat into the striatum to mimic the effects of the viral neurotoxin in the CNS. Added advantage of this model is that it is also amenable to repeated intraperitoneal cocaine injections, thereby allowing the study of the additive/synergistic effects of both the viral protein and cocaine. Such a model system recapitulates aspects of HAND in the context of drug abuse.",,"['Yao, Honghong', 'Buch, Shilpa']","['Yao H', 'Buch S']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, 985880 Nebraska Medical Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5880, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20120324,United States,J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,101256586,"['0 (Neurotoxins)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)']",IM,"['AIDS Dementia Complex/*complications/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cocaine/*pharmacology', 'Cocaine-Related Disorders/*complications/metabolism', 'Corpus Striatum/drug effects/pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurotoxins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/metabolism']",2012/03/27 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/03/27 06:00'],"['2011/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11481-012-9355-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2012 Jun;7(2):341-51. doi: 10.1007/s11481-012-9355-2.

This study assesses the influence of work-related factors in cancer incidence of cabin crew members. A cohort of 8,507 female and 1,559 male airline cabin attendants from Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden was followed for cancer incidence for a mean follow-up time of 23.6 years through the national cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were defined as ratios of observed and expected numbers of cases. A case-control study nested in the cohort (excluding Norway) was conducted to assess the relation between the estimated cumulative cosmic radiation dose and cumulative number of flights crossing six time zones (indicator of circadian disruption) and cancer risk. Analysis of breast cancer was adjusted for parity and age at first live birth. Among female cabin crew, a significantly increased incidence was observed for breast cancer [SIR 1.50, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.32-1.69], leukemia (1.89, 95% CI 1.03-3.17) and skin melanoma (1.85, 95% CI 1.41-2.38).

Adverse effects of GM-CSF.,1915-22,10.3892/ijo.2012.1410 [doi],"Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is considered to be the most effective immunostimulating factor for the construction of gene-engineered anti-cancer vaccines. In some tumour cells, this type of genetic modification has resulted in the loss of the oncogenic potential. This was not the case with bcr-abl-transformed mouse 12B1 cells. A cell line, designated 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5 producing more than 100 ng/106 cells/24 h, displayed higher pathogenicity than the parental, non-transduced cells. Although the tumours induced by the parental 12B1 cells and 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5 cells appeared nearly at the same time and then grew at an approximately equal rate, the latter mice were in a much poorer clinical condition. In these animals the growth of the tumours was associated with gradually increasing blood levels of GM-CSF. In both groups of animals splenomegaly was observed; it was much more pronounced in the case of 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5-inoculated animals. While in the case of animals inoculated with the parental cells the splenomegaly was probably mainly due to infiltration with tumour cells, in the animals inoculated with the GM-CSF-secreting cells splenomegaly and derangement of parenchymal organs, such as lungs, liver and kidneys, were more complex, including congestion and infiltration with hemopoietic cells, predominantly immature cells of myeloid lineage. The most conspicuous of these changes was the hyperaemia of the lungs. No such alterations were seen in animals inoculated with the parental cells. On the other hand, the contents of T regulatory cells were comparable in both groups and they increased in parallel at the end of the observation period. When GM-CSF neutralizing antibody was administered to animals inoculated with the 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5 cells, the pathological changes observed within the organs were suppressed, this proving that the overproduced GM-CSF and not any other substance, played the key role in their induction.",,"['Petrackova, Martina', 'Stanek, Libor', 'Mandys, Vaclav', 'Dundr, Pavel', 'Vonka, Vladimir']","['Petrackova M', 'Stanek L', 'Mandys V', 'Dundr P', 'Vonka V']","['Department of Experimental Virology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120322,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/immunology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Tumor Burden']",2012/03/27 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/03/27 06:00'],"['2011/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2012.1410 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Jun;40(6):1915-22. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1410.

Treatment with sorafenib/obatoclax induced pronounced apoptosis in and reduced the clonogenic growth of multiple AML lines and primary AML cells but not normal CD34(+) cells. Sorafenib triggered rapid and pronounced Mcl-1 down-regulation accompanied by enhanced binding of Bim to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, effects that were abolished by obatoclax coadministration. Notably, shRNA knockdown of Bim, Bak, or Bax, but not Noxa, significantly attenuated obatoclax/sorafenib lethality, whereas ectopic expression of Mcl-1 exerted a protective effect. Furthermore, exposure of leukemia cells to sorafenib and obatoclax markedly induced autophagy, reflected by rapid and pronounced LC3 processing and LC3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) punctate formation. Multiple autophagy inhibitors or VPS34 knockdown, significantly potentiated sorafenib/obatoclax lethality, indicating a cytoprotective role for autophagy in this setting. Finally, studies in a xenograft mouse model revealed that combined sorafenib/obatoclax treatment markedly reduced tumor growth and significantly prolonged survival in association with Mcl-1 down-regulation and apoptosis induction, whereas agents administered individually had only modest effects.

We found significantly greater numbers of BM B cell precursors in patients who did not develop cGVHD compared with those who developed cGVHD (median = 44 vs 2 cells/high powered field [hpf]; respectively; P < .001). Importantly, a significant increase in precursor B cells was maintained when patients receiving high-dose steroid therapy were excluded (median = 49 vs 20 cells/hpf; P = .017). Thus, we demonstrate the association of BM B cell production capacity in human GVHD development.

Few published data are currently available regarding for the use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) compared to bone marrow (BM) in the RIC-alloSCT using unrelated donors (URDs). This retrospective report compared the outcomes of PBSC versus BM RIC-alloSCT. Between 2000 and 2007, 602 patients with AML in complete remission (CR) underwent RIC-alloSCT from URDs with PBSC (508) or BM (94) grafts. Recipient's age was higher in the PBSC versus BM groups 57 (range, 17-77 years) and 51 (range, 17-76 years), respectively (P < .0001). Leukemia features and disease status at RIC-alloSCT were also comparable between the PBSC versus BM groups. Engraftment was achieved in 97% and 96% with BM versus peripheral blood (PB), respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade >II was significantly higher in the PBSC group: 27% versus 12% in the BM group (P < .002). Similarly, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD; at 2 years) was somewhat higher in the PBSC group with 43% +/- 3% versus 35% +/- 6% in the BM group, respectively (P = .04). The 2-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 46% +/- 3% for the PBSC group in comparison to 43% +/- 6% for the BM transplant group (P = NS), whereas relapse incidence was significantly higher in the BM versus the PB transplant group: 46% +/- 6% versus 32% +/- 3%, respectively (P = .014). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly higher for the PBSC versus the BM group: 28% +/- 2% versus 13% +/- 4%, respectively (P = .004). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for differences between both groups, the PBSC group was associated with a higher incidence of aGVHD (grade II-IV; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.33; P = .06), higher NRM (HR = 2.3; P = .015), and a decreased relapse incidence (HR, 0.61; P = .02) with no statistical difference of LFS between the 2 groups (P = .88). In conclusion, our results indicate significantly higher incidence of aGVHD and NRM and a lower incidence of relapse but not statistically different LFS comparing unrelated PBSC to BM grafts after RIC-alloSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

CLL B-cells co-culture with different adherent cell types, collectively referred to as stromal cells, induces leukemia cell survival, migration, and drug resistance. In addition, such survival-promoting microenvironments can rescue leukemia cells from cytotoxic therapy, giving way to disease relapse. Quite surprisingly considering that many anti-cancer drugs, including gamma-secretase inhibitors, Cyclopamine and Quercetin, were reported to block Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog anti-apoptotic signaling pathways respectively, the link between the latter anti-apoptotic pathways and bone marrow stromal cells in CLL has been pointed out only recently.

Therapeutic options for advanced B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia are still limited and acquired drug resistance and extramedullary tissue infiltration are two major obstacles during treatment. The prenylflavonoid xanthohumol (XN) has shown in vitro and in vivo therapeutic potential against a range of tumors. In the present study we investigated the effects of XN on B-ALL cells in vitro and in an ALL-like xenograft mouse model. Treatment of ALL cell lines with XN resulted in growth arrest and apoptosis induction. XN retained its cytotoxicity when adriamycin resistant cells were examined while ALL cell clones adapted to long-term exposure to XN resulted highly responsive to cytotoxic drugs. Administration of 50mug XN/mouse (5 days/week) significantly increased animal life span by delaying the insurgence of neurological disorders due to leukemic cells dissemination. In agreement with a less invasive phenotype, cell migration and invasion were impaired by XN and basal levels of FAK, AKT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways were down-regulated in ALL cells upon XN exposure. Our data indicate that XN has significant antileukemic activity both in vitro and in vivo, which associates with impaired cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, this activity overcomes mechanisms leading to drug-resistance. XN represents a promising agent perspective for ALL therapy and recurrence prevention and would deserve clinical testing in the near future.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human. METHODS: High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was applied for investigating the allele frequencies of 3 miR-TS-SNPs (PLA2G2A, IL-16, and NOD2) in acute leukemia. We also compared the genotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients at initial diagnosis and complete remission. RESULTS: HRM analysis revealed 3 genotypes (both homozygous and heterozygous) in the 3 miR-TS-SNPs. The allele frequencies of all 3 miR-TS-SNPs were similar in normal individuals and patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Most patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the same genotypes at initial diagnosis and complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: Large scale scanning of case-control studies for miR-TS-SNPs may contribute to the investigation of their roles and pathogenesis mechanisms in human diseases. Our study showed that HRM analysis can be an efficient tool for studies of miR-TS-SNPs.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (HPSCs) collected by apheresis are being increasingly employed for allogeneic transplantation in patients with malignancies as an alternative to bone marrow (BM) transplant. Documenting the safety of G-CSF as a mobilizing agent for HPSC donation has long been a matter of importance for physicians, particularly when volunteer, unrelated adult donors are involved. AREAS COVERED: We review publications in the field with the goal of providing an overview of these approaches. EXPERT OPINION: Trials and international donor registries have not shown any long-term effects associated with G-CSF therapy and a threefold-or-greater increased risk of leukemia or other malignancies through PB HPSC donation can be excluded. Our conclusions are that the administration of G-CSF to healthy donors has a favorable long-term risk-benefit profile, although it is essential to encourage the enrolment of donors in carefully designed programs for follow-up monitoring.",,"['Martino, Massimo', 'Fedele, Roberta', 'Massara, Elisabetta', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Irrera, Giuseppe', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Martino M', 'Fedele R', 'Massara E', 'Recchia AG', 'Irrera G', 'Morabito F']","['Oncology Department, Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, 89100 Reggio, Calabria, Italy. maxmartino65@alice.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120324,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['*Blood Donors', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/etiology']",2012/03/27 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2012/03/27 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2012.674937 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2012 May;12(5):609-21. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2012.674937.

However, its anti-cancer activity in human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells is not clear. This study aimed to study the anti-cancer effect and action of curcumin on THP-1 cells. METHODS: THP-1 parental cells and PMA-treated THP-1 cells, were used as in vitro models to evaluate the anti-cancer effect and mechanism of curcumin. Apoptosis and its mechanism were evaluated by WST-1, flow cytometry and Western blotting. MAPK inhibitors were used to further confirm the molecular mechanism of curcumin-induced THP-1 cell apoptosis. RESULTS: Curcumin induced cell apoptosis of THP-1 cells as shown by cell viability, cell cycle analysis and caspase activity. Curcumin significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and their downstream molecules (c-Jun and Jun B). Inhibitor of JNK and ERK reduced the pro-apoptotic effect of curcumin on THP-1 cells as evidenced by caspase activity and the activation of ERK/JNK/Jun cascades. On the contrary, the pro-apoptotic effect of curcumin was abolished in the differentiated THP-1 cells mediated by PMA. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that curcumin can induce the THP-1 cell apoptosis through the activation of JNK/ERK/AP1 pathways. Besides, our data suggest its novel use as an anti-tumor agent in acute monocytic leukemia.",,"['Yang, Chu-Wen', 'Chang, Chi-Lun', 'Lee, Hsin-Chen', 'Chi, Chin-Wen', 'Pan, Jia-Ping', 'Yang, Wen-Chin']","['Yang CW', 'Chang CL', 'Lee HC', 'Chi CW', 'Pan JP', 'Yang WC']","['Department of Microbiology, Soochow University, Shih-Lin, Taipei 111, Taiwan, ROC. ycw6861@scu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120324,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcuma/*chemistry', 'Curcumin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",2012/03/27 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2012/03/27 06:00'],"['2011/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-12-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-12-22 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2012 Mar 24;12:22. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-12-22.,,,,,PMC3342909,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a group of 19 acridinone (imidazoacridinone and triazoloacridinone) derivatives was chromatographed in six RP-HPLC systems, and the values of their HPLC retention data as retention' times determined in both 10 min and 30 min gradient times were obtained as well as log kw (retention factor log k extrapolated to 0% organic modifier) parameters using DryLab program were calculated. Additionally, molecular modeling studies were performed based on the structural formula of considered acridinones and structural descriptors were derived as well as log P parameters using some commonly available software were calculated and subsequently used. A matrix of 19 x 32 HPLC data together with log P data and molecular properties parameters was subjected to factor analysis and led to extract three main factors with eigenvalues higher than 1. The first principal component (factor 1) accounted for, by 80.87% of the variance in data, the second principal component (factor 2) explained 7.77% and the third principal component (factor 3) was responsible by 4.46% of data variance. The total data variance was at the level 93.09% and was explained by the first three principal components. Moreover, one of the most significant influences on the values of factor 1 and factor 2 possessed HPLC retention data and calculated parameters describing lipophilicity, respectively.

In CML patients, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) the terminally differentiated cells of myeloid series exhibit defects in several actin dependent functions such as adhesion, motility, chemotaxis, agglutination, phagocytosis and microbicidal activities. A definite and global abnormality was observed in stimulation of actin polymerization in CML PMNL. Signalling molecules ras and rhoGTPases regulate spatial and temporal polymerization of actin and thus, a broad range of physiological processes. Therefore, status of these GTPases as well as actin was studied in resting and fMLP stimulated normal and CML PMNL. METHODS: To study expression of GTPases and actin, Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis were done, while spatial expression and colocalization of these proteins were studied by using laser confocal microscopy. To study effect of inhibitors on cell proliferation CCK-8 assay was done. Significance of differences in expression of proteins within the samples and between normal and CML was tested by using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney test, respectively. Bivariate and partial correlation analyses were done to study relationship between all the parameters. RESULTS: In CML PMNL, actin expression and its architecture were altered and stimulation of actin polymerization was absent. Differences were also observed in expression, organization or stimulation of all the three GTPases in normal and CML PMNL. In normal PMNL, ras was the critical GTPase regulating expression of rhoGTPases and actin and actin polymerization. But in CML PMNL, rhoA took a central place. In accordance with these, treatment with rho/ROCK pathway inhibitors resulted in specific growth inhibition of CML cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: RhoA has emerged as the key molecule responsible for functional defects in CML PMNL and therefore can be used as a therapeutic target in CML.",,"['Molli, Poonam R', 'Pradhan, Madhura B', 'Advani, Suresh H', 'Naik, Nishigandha R']","['Molli PR', 'Pradhan MB', 'Advani SH', 'Naik NR']","['Cancer Research Institute, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai 410210, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120325,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '138381-45-0 (Y 27632)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (exoenzyme C3, Clostridium botulinum)', 'EC 3.4.24.69 (Botulinum Toxins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/pharmacology', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Amides/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Botulinum Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2012/03/27 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/03/27 06:00'],"['2011/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-11-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-11-16 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2012 Mar 25;11:16. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-11-16.,,,,,PMC3353160,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2011) Nucleic Acids Res 39, 1042-1053]. These dinucleotide pairs are stabilized by RTs that are capable of 'clamping' together the otherwise unstable duplexes. This RT-driven stabilization of the micro-homology sequence promotes efficient DNA synthesis. In the present study, we have examined several factors associated with the sequence and structure of the DNA substrate that are critical for the clamp activity of RTs from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), murine leukemia virus (MLV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and the long terminal repeat retrotransposon Tf1. The parameters studied were the minimal complementarity length between the primer and functional template termini that sustains stable clamps, the effects of gaps between the two template strands on the clamp activity of the tested RTs, the effects of template end phosphorylations on the RT-associated clamp activities, and clamp activity with a long 'hairpin' double-stranded primer comprising both the primer and the complementary non-functional template strands. The results show that the substrate conditions for clamp activity of HIV-1 and MLV RTs are more stringent, while Tf1 and BIV RTs show clamp activity under less rigorous substrate conditions.

MTG16 is implicated in hematopoietic development and in controlling erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, ETO homologue genes are 3'participants in leukemia fusions generated by chromosomal translocations responsible of hematopoietic dysregulation. We tried to identify structural and functional promoter elements of MTG16 and MTGR1 genes in order to find associations between their regulation and hematopoiesis. RESULTS: 5' deletion examinations and luciferase reporter gene studies indicated that a 492 bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site is essential for transcriptional activity by the MTG16 promoter. The TATA- and CCAAT-less promoter with a GC box close to the start site showed strong reporter activity when examined in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. Mutation of an evolutionary conserved GATA -301 consensus binding site repressed promoter function. Furthermore, results from in vitro antibody-enhanced electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated binding of GATA-1 to the GATA -301 site. A role of GATA-1 was also supported by transfection of small interfering RNA, which diminished MTG16 expression. Furthermore, expression of the transcription factor HERP2, which represses GATA-1, produced strong inhibition of the MTG16 promoter reporter consistent with a role of GATA-1 in transcriptional activation. The TATA-less and CCAAT-less MTGR1 promoter retained most of the transcriptional activity within a -308 to -207 bp region with a GC-box-rich sequence containing multiple SP1 binding sites reminiscent of a housekeeping gene with constitutive expression. However, mutations of individual SP1 binding sites did not repress promoter function; multiple active SP1 binding sites may be required to safeguard constitutive MTGR1 transcriptional activity. The observed repression of MTG16/MTGR1 promoters by the leukemia associated AML1-ETO fusion gene may have a role in hematopoietic dysfunction of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: An evolutionary conserved GATA binding site is critical in transcriptional regulation of the MTG16 promoter. In contrast, the MTGR1 gene depends on a GC-box-rich sequence for transcriptional regulation and possible ubiquitous expression. Our results demonstrate that the ETO homologue promoters are regulated differently consistent with hematopoietic cell-type- specific expression and function.",,"['Ajore, Ram', 'Kumar, Parveen', 'Dhanda, Rakesh Singh', 'Gullberg, Urban', 'Olsson, Inge']","['Ajore R', 'Kumar P', 'Dhanda RS', 'Gullberg U', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Hematology, C14, BMC, S-221 84, Lund, Sweden.

In this study, we analysed the trajectories of PML bodies using single-particle tracking. RESULTS: We observed that the recovery of PML protein after photobleaching was ATP dependent in both wild-type (wt) and A-type lamin-deficient cells. The movement of PML bodies was faster and the nuclear area occupied by particular PML bodies was larger in A-type lamin-deficient fibroblasts compared with their wt counterparts. Moreover, dysfunction of the LMNA gene increased the frequency of mutual interactions between individual PML bodies and influenced the morphology of these domains at the ultrastructural level. As a consequence of A-type lamin deficiency, PML protein accumulated in nuclear blebs and frequently appeared at the nuclear periphery. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the physiological function of lamin A proteins is important for events that occur in the compartment of PML bodies. This observation was confirmed in other experimental models characterised by lamin changes, including apoptosis or the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Societe Francaise des Microscopies and Societe de Biologie', 'Cellulaire de France.']","['Stixova, Lenka', 'Matula, Pavel', 'Kozubek, Stanislav', 'Gombitova, Adriana', 'Cmarko, Dusan', 'Raska, Ivan', 'Bartova, Eva']","['Stixova L', 'Matula P', 'Kozubek S', 'Gombitova A', 'Cmarko D', 'Raska I', 'Bartova E']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 61265 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (Lmna protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Kinetics', 'Lamin Type A/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2012/03/27 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/03/27 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/boc.201100053 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 2012 Jul;104(7):418-32. doi: 10.1111/boc.201100053.

However, its function in leukemia, particularly chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), is poorly understood. Here we have reported the identification of miR-181a targets by combining TargetScan software prediction and expression profiling through overexpression of miR-181a mimic in leukemic K562 cells. Four overlapping genes were found to be the likely targets of miR-181a. Among the four genes, RalA is a downstream molecule of bcr-abl fusion protein in ras signaling pathway. However, its role in CML remains elusive. Luciferase reporter and Western blot assays confirmed that RalA is a direct target of miR-181a. overexpression of miR-181a effectively suppresses cell growth and induces G2-phase arrest and apoptosis partially by targeting RalA in leukemic K562 cells. Using the KEGG database combined with recent publications, downstream signaling pathway of RalA was graphed by cytoscape software. Therefore, our study is the first to report that RalA is directly regulated by miR-181a and plays an important role in CML.

While Bax is mostly cytosolic and translocates to mitochondria following an apoptotic stimulus, Bak is constitutively integrated within the outer membrane. Membrane anchorage occurs via a C-terminal transmembrane domain that has been studied in Bax but not in Bak, therefore what governs their distinct subcellular distribution is uncertain. In addition, whether the distinct subcellular distributions of Bak and Bax contributes to their differential regulation during apoptosis remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To gain insight into Bak and Bax targeting to mitochondria, elements of the Bak C-terminus were mutated, or swapped with those of Bax. Truncation of the C-terminal six residues (C-segment) or substitution of three basic residues within the C-segment destabilized Bak. Replacing the Bak C-segment with that from Bax rescued stability and function, but unexpectedly resulted in a semi-cytosolic protein, termed Bak/BaxCS. When in the cytosol, both Bax and Bak/BaxCS sequestered their hydrophobic transmembrane domains in their hydrophobic surface groove. Upon apoptotic signalling, Bak/BaxCS translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane, inserted its transmembrane domain, oligomerized, and released cytochrome c. Despite this Bax-like subcellular distribution, Bak/BaxCS retained Bak-like regulation following targeting of Mcl-1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Residues in the C-segment of Bak and of Bax contribute to their distinct subcellular localizations. That a semi-cytosolic form of Bak, Bak/BaxCS, could translocate to mitochondria and release cytochrome c indicates that Bak and Bax share a conserved mode of activation. In addition, the differential regulation of Bak and Bax by Mcl-1 is predominantly independent of the initial subcellular localizations of Bak and Bax.",,"['Ferrer, Pedro Eitz', 'Frederick, Paul', 'Gulbis, Jacqueline M', 'Dewson, Grant', 'Kluck, Ruth M']","['Ferrer PE', 'Frederick P', 'Gulbis JM', 'Dewson G', 'Kluck RM']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytochromes c/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/03/24 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031510 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09115 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e31510. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031510.

Additionally, the use of sophisticated diagnostic tools and screening modalities has increased over recent years. Because of these factors, cancer is being diagnosed more frequently during the child-rearing years. Sociodemographic and cancer-related information on families and minor (0-18 years) and young adult (YA) (19-25 years) children experiencing parental cancer is scarce, but this information is vital for healthcare initiatives aimed toward those potentially adversely affected. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe features of families and minor and YA children affected by parental cancer in a nationwide population. METHODS: Complete Norwegian birth cohort data were obtained from national registries. Descriptive prevalence and incidence statistics were collected for parents and minor and YA children. Logistic regression models were used to assess factors likely to influence parental death. RESULTS: Every year around 0.3% of all families with children under the age of 18 years encounter parental cancer, and 3.1% of minors and 8.4% of YAs have a parent who has been diagnosed with cancer. This study found skin, breast, testicular, and colorectal cancers were the most common forms of cancer diagnosed. The sociodemographic features of those affected were fairly similar to those of the general population. One in five children experienced parental death from cancer; parental death was more often paternal than maternal and was most common in parents diagnosed with leukemia or brain, colorectal, and lung tumors. Deaths are uncommon among parents without cancer. CONCLUSION: Adequate assistance for minor and YA children affected by parental cancer requires knowledge of their number and characteristics. Parental cancer is more common than previously suggested: the annual incidence of parental cancer for children under 18 years of age is 0.3%, whereas approximately 4% of children aged 0-25 years have or have had parents diagnosed with cancer, corresponding to a population prevalence of 1.4%. Around 20% of these children experience parental death, and surveys of live respondents should account for this.",,"['Syse, Astri', 'Aas, Gjoril B', 'Loge, Jon H']","['Syse A', 'Aas GB', 'Loge JH']","['Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120313,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,,,2012/03/24 06:00,2012/03/24 06:01,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S28984 [doi]', 'clep-4-041 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2012;4:41-52. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S28984.

In the present study, we investigated 108 CEBPA-mutated AML patients for the impact of MLD, karyotype, and additional mutations. MLD(+) patients differed from MLD(-) patients only by lower mean WBC counts, not by biologic characteristics, cytogenetic risk profiles, or additional mutations. Survival was better for female patients, patients < 60 years of age, for intermediate versus adverse karyotypes, and, in the case of FLT3-ITD negativity, biallelic versus monoallelic/homozygous CEBPA mutations. In contrast, 2-year overall survival and event-free survival did not differ significantly between MLD(+) and MLD(-) patients. By univariable Cox regression analysis, sex, age, WBC count, and cytogenetic risk category were related to overall survival, but MLD was not.

The cytologic complete response (CR) rate was 89% after induction phases 1 and 2. At this time point the molecular CR rate was 70% in 580 patients with cytologic CR and evaluable MRD. Patients with molecular CR after consolidation had a significantly higher probability of continuous complete remission (CCR; 74% vs 35%; P < .0001) and of overall survival (80% vs 42%; P = .0001) compared with patients with molecular failure.

Maximum transcriptional activation of Stat5b requires both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. Although the mechanisms governing tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat5b have been extensively studied, the role of serine phosphorylation remains to be fully elucidated. Using mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we identified Ser-193 as a novel site of cytokine-induced phosphorylation within human Stat5b. Stat5b Ser(P)-193 was detected in activated primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lymphoid cell lines in response to several gamma common (gammac) cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Kinetic and spatial analysis indicated that Stat5b Ser-193 phosphorylation was rapid and transient and occurred in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell prior to Stat5b translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, inducible Stat5b Ser-193 phosphorylation was sensitive to inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) induced phosphorylation of Ser-193. Reconstitution assays in HEK293 cells in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis, EMSA, and reporter assays indicated that Ser(P)-193 is required for maximal Stat5b transcriptional activity. Indeed, Stat5b Ser-193 was found constitutively phosphorylated in several lymphoid tumor cell lines as well as primary leukemia and lymphoma patient tumor cells. Taken together, IL-2 family cytokines tightly control Stat5b Ser-193 phosphorylation through a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism. Furthermore, constitutive Ser-193 phosphorylation is associated with Stat5b proto-oncogenic activity and therefore may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating hematopoietic malignancies.",,"['Mitra, Abhisek', 'Ross, Jeremy A', 'Rodriguez, Georgialina', 'Nagy, Zsuzsanna S', 'Wilson, Harry L', 'Kirken, Robert A']","['Mitra A', 'Ross JA', 'Rodriguez G', 'Nagy ZS', 'Wilson HL', 'Kirken RA']","['Department of Biological Sciences and Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas, El Paso, Texas 79968, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120322,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/24 06:00,2012/07/14 06:00,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)60795-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.319756 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 May 11;287(20):16596-608. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.319756.

In this study, we assessed the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of lobaplatin alone or in combination with antitubulin agents against human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: The cytotoxicities of lobaplatin against NSCLC cells were determined by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry, and the in-vivo antitumor activities were evaluated in human NSCLC xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of lobaplatin was similar to or higher than that of cisplatin and carboplatin, with a mean IC(50) of 2.5 mumol/l in a variety of NSCLC cells. In addition, lobaplatin arrested cells in the S phase and triggered apoptosis. The combination of lobaplatin with antitubulin agents yielded synergistic cytotoxic activity in vitro. In NSCLC xenografts, lobaplatin alone showed significant antitumor activity. The combination of lobaplatin with antitubulin agents, especially with paclitaxel, led to significantly enhanced activity, which was superior to that of cisplatin combined with antitubulin agents. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the use of lobaplatin alone or in combination with antitubulin agents might be a rational and novel therapeutic strategy for human NSCLC and warrants further clinical investigation.",,"['Xie, Cheng-Ying', 'Xu, Yong-Ping', 'Jin, Wei', 'Lou, Li-Guang']","['Xie CY', 'Xu YP', 'Jin W', 'Lou LG']","['Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclobutanes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'OX5XK1JD8C (lobaplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclobutanes/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Tubulin Modulators/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Vinorelbine', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/03/24 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328352cc10 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Aug;23(7):698-705. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328352cc10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But so far, the induced antileukemic T-cell responses are variable both in specificity and in efficacy. In an attempt to elucidate the underlying causes of different T-cell response patterns, T-cell receptor (TR) Vbeta chain rearrangements were correlated with the T cells corresponding immunophenotypic profile, as well as their proliferative response and cytolytic capacities. In three different settings, donor T cells, either human leukocyte antigen matched or mismatched (haploidentical), or autologous T cells were repeatedly stimulated with myeloid blasts or leukemia-derived DC/DCleus from the corresponding patients diseased from acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although no significant differences in T-cell proliferation were observed, the T-cell-mediated cytolytic response pattern varied considerably and even caused blast proliferation in two cases. Spectratyping revealed a remarkable restriction (>75% of normal level) of the CD4+ or CD8+-TR repertoire of blast- or DC/DCleu-stimulated T cells. Although in absolute terms, DC/DCleu stimulation induced the highest grade of restriction in the CD8+ T-cell subset, the CD4+ T-cell compartment seemed to be relatively more affected. But most importantly, in vitro stimulation with DC/DCleu resulted into an identical TR restriction pattern (beta chain) that could be identified in vivo in a patient sample 3 months after allo-SCT. Thus, in vitro tests combining functional flow cytometry with spectratyping might provide predictive information about T cellular response patterns in vivo.",,"['Reuther, Susanne', 'Schmetzer, Helga', 'Schuster, Friedhelm R', 'Krell, Pina', 'Grabrucker, Christine', 'Liepert, Anja', 'Kroell, Tanja', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Buhmann, Raymund']","['Reuther S', 'Schmetzer H', 'Schuster FR', 'Krell P', 'Grabrucker C', 'Liepert A', 'Kroell T', 'Kolb HJ', 'Borkhardt A', 'Buhmann R']","['Faculty of Medical, Department of Paediatric Oncology, Haematology and Immunology, University Dusseldorf, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120323,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytological Techniques/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis']",2012/03/24 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2011/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-012-0180-y [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2013 Feb;13(1):29-48. doi: 10.1007/s10238-012-0180-y.

Developmental paths and outcomes between trauma and resilience].,481-92,10.1007/s00103-012-1449-8 [doi],"In Europe and North America, about 80% of all patients with cancer in childhood and adolescence survive their leukemia, lymphomas or tumors. Therefore, neuropsychological impairments, psychopathological comorbidity and health-related quality of life become relevant parameters for treatment evaluation and conceptualization of future therapy protocols. During the last decade, a number of patient registries, multicenter studies and meta-analyses have analyzed the interaction of disease- and treatment-associated risk factors with pre-existing socio-demographic and psychosocial vulnerability factors. Brain tumors and treatment strategies including CNS surgery, cranial radiotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy carry an increased risk for neurological and neuropsychological long-term outcomes, which in turn also threatens the patients' psychosocial and vocational participation. In the area of psychosocial adaptation, a wide range of developmental paths results, ranging from increased psychological comorbidity, to subclinical impairments in quality of life, to normal courses to resilient outcomes, even with a developmental benefit. A hypothetical model is presented to explain this enormous variance in outcomes. Protective cognitive-emotional schemata already established at the premorbid stage predispose patients to be able to cope successfully with cancer-related challenges and thus further enhance the patients' future adaptability. In contrast, dysfunctional schemata at the premorbid level increase risks of coping failure and thus intensify the long-term risk for psychopathological comorbidity in terms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder or depression.",,"['Noeker, M']",['Noeker M'],"['Psychologischer Psychotherapeut fur Kinder, Jugendliche und Erwachsene, Zentrum fur Kinderheilkunde der Universitat Bonn, Adenauerallee 119, 53113, Bonn, Deutschland. m.noeker@uni-bonn.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",101181368,,IM,"['Causality', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease/*mortality/psychology', 'Comorbidity', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy/*trends', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/psychology', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2012/03/24 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00103-012-1449-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz. 2012 Apr;55(4):481-92. doi: 10.1007/s00103-012-1449-8.,Uberlebende von Krebserkrankungen des Kindes- und Jugendalters.

The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), involved in folate metabolism, plays a crucial role in cells because folate availability is important for DNA integrity. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the association of the C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 275 leukaemia cases - including AML (n = 112), ALL (n = 81), CML (n = 43), CLL (n = 39) - and 251 age/sex-matched healthy control individuals participated in this study. MTHFR C677T polymorphisms in the cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The average MTHFR 677CC, 677CT, 677TT genotype frequencies of total leukaemia cases were 68.73%, 19.64%, and 11.64% in cases, and 71.71%, 24.30%, and 3.98% in healthy controls, respectively. The average frequency of the MTHFR 677T allele was 21.45% among the cases compared to 16.13% among the controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the present case-control study we have observed a higher frequency of the MTHFR 677TT genotype in cases of leukaemia (AML, ALL, CML and CLL) as compared with controls; this might be due to ethnic and geographic variation. As per our findings, although the frequency of the MTHFR 677T allele is moderately high in AML, ALL and CLL, no statistically significant association was found; on the other hand statistically significant association was found in the context of CML cases.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to apoptosis-related biochemical events, photo-irradiated PhB generated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), induced phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) in an oxidative stress-dependent manner and up-regulated the gene expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma, an inducer of diverse apoptosis-related molecules in activated T cells. PhB-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-l-cysteine, but not by catalase, indicating that ROS generation occurred intracellularly, and by SP600125 and AG490, specific inhibitors of JNK and IFN-gamma signaling, respectively, confirming their roles in the apoptotic pathway. IFN-gamma up-regulation was also inhibited by SP600125, indicating that it was downstream of JNK activation. These results suggest that PhB-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells partially involves the intracellular oxidative stress-sensitive and T cell-specific IFN-gamma pathway. These data present a novel insight into the mechanisms of photocytotoxicity induced by artificial food colorants in human T lymphocytic leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite adequate anticoagulation, a patient's clinical condition can rapidly deteriorate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of local thrombolysis in these patients. Consecutive patients with progressive cerebral venous thrombosis between October 2008 and January 2011 were enrolled prospectively. Progressive CVT was defined as the persistence of neurologic findings (headache, blurred vision, and visual field defects) despite at least four days (or 48 hours in patients with involvement of more than one sinus) on full anticoagulation therapy with heparin and development of focal neurologic deficits or cortical hemorrhage. We excluded patients with large hematomas and predisposing malignancies like leukemia. All patients underwent local thrombolysis with 30 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). Overall, 26 patients were enrolled with a mean age of 35.5 years (range 18 to 56 years). Six patients (23%) were male and twenty patients (77%) were female. The most common presenting feature was headache and the most common neurologic finding was papilledema, which was present in all patients. Eighty-five percent of women had a history of oral contraceptive pill consumption. Successful recanalization was achieved in all patients except one (96.2%). Neurological examinations and follow-up assessments were based on a modified Rankin scale (mRS). Favorable outcome and recovery was defined as a mRS score of 0-1. Follow-up assessments at the third week showed that 25 out of 26 recovered, with 18 having a mRS score of 0 and 7 with a mRS score of 1. There were no procedure-related neurological complications.

Age at death and cause of death are gathered through the Japanese national family registry system and cancer incidence data have been collected through the Hiroshima and Nagasaki cancer registries. Noncancer disease incidence and health information are collected through biannual medical examinations among a subset of the LSS. Radiation significantly increases the risks of death (22% at 1 Gy), cancer incidence (47% at 1 Gy), death due to leukemia (310% at 1 Gy), as well as the incidence of several noncancer diseases (e.g. thyroid nodules, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, uterine myoma, and hypertension).

The DNA methylation inhibitors decitabine and azacitidine are efficacious for hematological neoplasms at lower, less toxic, doses. Experimentally, high doses induce rapid DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which do not explain the prolonged time to response observed in patients. We show that transient exposure of cultured and primary leukemic and epithelial tumor cells to clinically relevant nanomolar doses, without causing immediate cytotoxicity, produce an antitumor ""memory"" response, including inhibition of subpopulations of cancer stem-like cells. These effects are accompanied by sustained decreases in genomewide promoter DNA methylation, gene reexpression, and antitumor changes in key cellular regulatory pathways.

Despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses and the growing interest in cats as pets, information about FeLV and FIV in Malaysia is presently insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners. A cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to December 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with FeLV and FIV among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia. Plasma samples were harvested from the blood of 368 domestic cats and screened for evidence of FeLV p27 antigen and FIV antibodies, using an immunochromatographic kit. Additionally, data on cat demographics and health were collected using a structured questionnaire, and were evaluated as potential risk factors for FeLV or FIV status. RESULTS: Of the 368 cats that were evaluated in this study, 12.2% (45/368; 95% CI = 8.88 - 15.58) were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 31.3%, (115/368; 95% CI = 26.51 - 35.99) were seropositive to FIV antibodies, and 4.3% (16/368; 95% CI = 2.27 - 6.43) had evidence of both viruses. Factors found to significantly increase the risk for FeLV seropositivity include sex, age, behaviour, sickness, and living in a multi-cat household. Seropositive response to FIV was significantly associated with sex, neuter status, age, behaviour, and health status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that FeLV and FIV are common among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia, and that factors related to cat demographics and health such as age, sex, behaviour, health status and type of household are important predictors for seropositive status to FeLV or FIV in peninsular Malaysia. High prevalence of FeLV or FIV observed in our study is of concern, in view of the immunosuppressive potentials of the two pathogens. Specific measures for control and prevention such as screening and routine vaccination are needed to ensure that FeLV and FIV are controlled in the cat population of peninsular Malaysia.",,"['Bande, Faruku', 'Arshad, Siti Suri', 'Hassan, Latiffah', 'Zakaria, Zunita', 'Sapian, Nurul Asyikin', 'Rahman, Noor Alimah', 'Alazawy, Amer']","['Bande F', 'Arshad SS', 'Hassan L', 'Zakaria Z', 'Sapian NA', 'Rahman NA', 'Alazawy A']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM Serdang Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120322,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Female', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Ownership', 'Prevalence', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Risk Factors', 'Serologic Tests', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary']",2012/03/24 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/03/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1746-6148-8-33 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-6148-8-33 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2012 Mar 22;8:33. doi: 10.1186/1746-6148-8-33.,,,,,PMC3349470,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus is culturable in various cells of human origin like the lymphocytes, NK cells, neuronal cells, and prostate cell lines. MicroRNAs (miRNA), which regulate gene expression, were so far not identified in cells infected with XMRV in culture. METHODS: Two prostate cell lines (LNCaP and DU145) and two primary cells, Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes [PBL] and Monocyte-derived Macrophages [MDM] were infected with XMRV. Total mRNA was extracted from mock- and virus-infected cells at 6, 24 and 48 hours post infection and evaluated for microRNA profile in a microarray. RESULTS: MicroRNA expression profiles of XMRV-infected continuous prostate cancer cell lines differ from that of virus-infected primary cells (PBL and MDMs). miR-193a-3p and miRPlus-E1245 observed to be specific to XMRV infection in all 4 cell types. While miR-193a-3p levels were down regulated miRPlus-E1245 on the other hand exhibited varied expression profile between the 4 cell types. DISCUSSION: The present study clearly demonstrates that cellular microRNAs are expressed during XMRV infection of human cells and this is the first report demonstrating the regulation of miR193a-3p and miRPlus-E1245 during XMRV infection in four different human cell types.",,"['Mohan, Ketha V K', 'Devadas, Krishnakumar', 'Sainath Rao, Shilpakala', 'Hewlett, Indira', 'Atreya, Chintamani']","['Mohan KV', 'Devadas K', 'Sainath Rao S', 'Hewlett I', 'Atreya C']","['Section of Cell Biology, Laboratory of Cellular Hematology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20120316,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN193 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/virology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/virology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0032853 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21291 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e32853. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032853.

Patients with SLL / CLL are at increased risk of site-specific secondary cancers. We present a unique case of a 71-year-old male, with a history of SLL / CLL, who presented with pulmonary symptoms and a mediastinal mass. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mediastinal lymph node revealed synchronous SLL / CLL and small cell carcinoma (SCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration of the mediastinal lymph node (4R). The sample was submitted for cytopathology, immunohistochemical stains, and flow cytometry evaluation. RESULTS: Fine needle aspiration of the mediastinal lymph node revealed neoplastic cells, in clusters and singly, with cytological features suggestive of small cell carcinoma. The immunohistochemistry results confirmed this diagnosis. Small-to-medium, mature-appearing lymphocytes were also present in the background. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that these lymphocytes possessed an immunophenotype consistent with CLL / SLL. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the importance of a pathologist's awareness of the possibility of concurrent lymphoma and metastatic carcinoma in a lymph node. When evaluating lymph nodes, pathologists must strive to identify both foreign cells and subtle lymphoid changes. As demonstrated by our case, ancillary techniques (such as immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry) can be critical to making a complete and accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis of small cell carcinoma in the enlarged lymph node, primarily harboring CLL / SLL, is of critical importance for decision-making and treatment purposes, in addition to having a significant adverse impact on the overall survival.",,"['Afify, Alaa', 'Das, Shweta', 'Mingyi, Chen']","['Afify A', 'Das S', 'Mingyi C']","['Address: Department of Medical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UC Davis Health System, 4400 V Street, PATH Building, Sacramento CA 95817.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20120224,United States,Cytojournal,CytoJournal,101231642,,,,2012/03/23 06:00,2012/03/23 06:01,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/1742-6413.93280 [doi]', 'CJ-9-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytojournal. 2012;9:5. doi: 10.4103/1742-6413.93280.

Concomitant binding to the activation domain of proto-oncogene protein c-Myb and the transactivation domain of the trithorax group protein mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) transcription factor lead to the biologically active ternary MLLratioKIXratioc-Myb complex which plays a role in Pol II-mediated transcription. The binding of the activation domain of MLL to KIX enhances c-Myb binding. Here we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the MLLratioKIXratioc-Myb ternary complex, its binary components and KIX with the goal of providing a mechanistic explanation for the experimental observations. The dynamic behavior revealed that the MLL binding site is allosterically coupled to the c-Myb binding site. MLL binding redistributes the conformational ensemble of KIX, leading to higher populations of states which favor c-Myb binding. The key element in the allosteric communication pathways is the KIX loop, which acts as a control mechanism to enhance subsequent binding events. We tested this conclusion by in silico mutations of loop residues in the KIXratioMLL complex and by comparing wild type and mutant dynamics through MD simulations. The loop assumed MLL binding conformation similar to that observed in the KIXratioc-Myb state which disfavors the allosteric network. The coupling with c-Myb binding site faded, abolishing the positive cooperativity observed in the presence of MLL. Our major conclusion is that by eliciting a loop-mediated allosteric switch between the different states following the binding events, transcriptional activation can be regulated. The KIX system presents an example how nature makes use of conformational control in higher level regulation of transcriptional activity and thus cellular events.",,"['Korkmaz, Elif Nihal', 'Nussinov, Ruth', 'Haliloglu, Turkan']","['Korkmaz EN', 'Nussinov R', 'Haliloglu T']","['Polymer Research Center & Chemical Engineering Department, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120315,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Computer Simulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', '*Models, Chemical', '*Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002420 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-11-01318 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2012;8(3):e1002420. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002420.

ICP0 has been shown to target a number of specific cellular proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation during lytic infection, including the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and its small ubiquitin-like modified (SUMO) isoforms. We have shown previously that ICP0 can catalyze the formation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains and mediate the ubiquitination of specific substrate proteins in vitro in the presence of two E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, namely, UBE2D1 (UbcH5a) and UBE2E1 (UbcH6), in a RING finger-dependent manner. Using homology modeling in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis, we identify specific residues required for the interaction between the RING finger domain of ICP0 and UBE2D1, and we report that point mutations at these residues compromise the ability of ICP0 to induce the colocalization of conjugated ubiquitin and the degradation of PML and its SUMO-modified isoforms. Furthermore, we show that RING finger mutants that are unable to interact with UBE2D1 fail not only to complement the plaque-forming defect of an ICP0-null mutant virus but also to mediate the derepression of quiescent HSV-1 genomes in cell culture. These data demonstrate that the ability of ICP0 to interact with cellular E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes is fundamentally important for its biological functions during HSV-1 infection.",,"['Vanni, Emilia', 'Gatherer, Derek', 'Tong, Lily', 'Everett, Roger D', 'Boutell, Chris']","['Vanni E', 'Gatherer D', 'Tong L', 'Everett RD', 'Boutell C']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120321,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2D1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.07210-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.07210-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jun;86(11):6323-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.07210-11.

In this study, a small interfering RNA (siRNA), siX3, was designed to target coding sequences within shared exon 3 of UL123 and UL122 transcripts encoding IE1 and IE2 immediate-early proteins of HCMV. Pretreatment of cells with siX3 reduced the levels of viral protein expression, DNA replication, and progeny virus production compared to control siRNA. Two siRNAs against UL54 and overlapping transcripts (UL55-57) were compared to siX3 in HCMV infection and were also found to be effective at inhibiting HCMV replication. Further investigation into the effects of the siRNAs on viral replication showed that pretreatment with each of the siRNAs resulted in an inhibition in the formation of mature replication compartments. The ability of these siRNAs to prevent or reduce certain cytopathic effects associated with HCMV infection was also examined. Infected cells pretreated with siX3, but not siUL54, retained promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in cellular PML bodies, an essential component of this host intrinsic antiviral defense. DNA damage response proteins, which are localized in nuclear viral replication compartments, were reduced in the siX3- and siUL54-treated cells. siX3, but not siUL54, prevented DNA damage response signaling early after infection. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated by treating cells with siRNAs after HCMV replication had commenced.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this prospective study. Informed consent was obtained from 400 consecutive adult outpatients (mean age, 49 years; 212 male and 188 female patients) undergoing lumbar spine CT for low back pain and/or radiculopathy. Those with known malignancy were excluded. Dedicated spinal and abdominal full-field-of-view (FOV) images for each patient were reviewed by at least one neuroradiologist and two body radiologists. Extraspinal abnormalities were classified according to the CT Colonography Reporting and Data System (C-RADS). The electronic medical record of the patients with C-RADS E3 and E4 extraspinal findings were reviewed to assess how many of these findings were previously unknown, and the patients were followed up 24-36 months after the initial CT to determine their work-up and outcome. RESULTS: Extraspinal findings were present on images in 162 (40.5%) of 400 lumbar spine CT examinations; 59 (14.8%) patients had indeterminate or clinically important findings requiring clinical correlation or further evaluation. After review of the electronic medical record, the prevalence of clinically important findings was 4.3%, comprising an early-stage renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, sarcoidosis, and 13 abdominal aortic aneurysms. Excluding anatomic variants, the full FOV was required to best visualize extraspinal abnormalities in 127 (79.4%) of 160 patients. CONCLUSION: Reviewing the full-FOV images from lumbar spine CT examinations will result in the detection of a small number of substantial extraspinal pathologic findings in addition to many benign incidental findings.",,"['Lee, Stefanie Y', 'Landis, Mark S', 'Ross, Ian G', 'Goela, Aashish', 'Leung, Andrew E']","['Lee SY', 'Landis MS', 'Ross IG', 'Goela A', 'Leung AE']","['Department of Medical Imaging, London Health Sciences Centre-University Hospital, London, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120321,United States,Radiology,Radiology,0401260,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Low Back Pain/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiculopathy/*diagnostic imaging', 'Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['radiol.12112152 [pii]', '10.1148/radiol.12112152 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiology. 2012 May;263(2):502-9. doi: 10.1148/radiol.12112152.

We recently identified the PTP DEP-1/CD148/PTPRJ as a novel negative regulator of FLT3. This study addressed the role of DEP-1 for regulation of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-related mutant FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) protein. Our experiments revealed that DEP-1 was expressed but dysfunctional in cells transformed by FLT3 ITD. This was caused by enzymatic inactivation of DEP-1 through oxidation of the DEP-1 catalytic cysteine. In intact cells, including primary AML cells, FLT3 ITD kinase inhibition reactivated DEP-1. DEP-1 reactivation was also achieved by counteracting the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production detected in FLT3 ITD-expressing cell lines by inhibition of reduced NAD phosphate (NADPH)-oxidases, or by overexpression of catalase or peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx-1). Interference with ROS production in 32D cells inhibited cell transformation by FLT3 ITD in a DEP-1-dependent manner, because RNAi-mediated depletion of DEP-1 partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of ROS quenching. Reactivation of DEP-1 by stable overexpression of Prx-1 extended survival of mice in the 32D cell/C3H/HeJ mouse model of FLT3 ITD-driven myeloproliferative disease. The study thus uncovered DEP-1 oxidation as a novel event contributing to cell transformation by FLT3 ITD.",,"['Godfrey, Rinesh', 'Arora, Deepika', 'Bauer, Reinhard', 'Stopp, Sabine', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Heinrich, Theresa', 'Bohmer, Sylvia-Annette', 'Dagnell, Markus', 'Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Scholl, Sebastian', 'Ostman, Arne', 'Bohmer, Frank-D']","['Godfrey R', 'Arora D', 'Bauer R', 'Stopp S', 'Muller JP', 'Heinrich T', 'Bohmer SA', 'Dagnell M', 'Schnetzke U', 'Scholl S', 'Ostman A', 'Bohmer FD']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120320,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRJ protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/pharmacology', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47889-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-336446 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 10;119(19):4499-511. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-336446.

Therefore, deciphering the signaling networks downstream of these oncogenic stimuli remains a challenge to gather insights into targeted therapy. To elucidate the biochemical networks connecting the Kit mutant to leukemogenesis, in the present study, we performed a global profiling of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from mutant Kit-driven murine leukemia proerythroblasts and identified Shp2 and Stat5 as proximal effectors of Kit. Shp2 or Stat5 gene depletion by sh-RNA, combined with pharmacologic inhibition of PI3kinase or Mek/Erk activities, revealed 2 distinct and independent signaling pathways contributing to malignancy. We demonstrate that cell survival is driven by the Kit/Shp2/Ras/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway, whereas the G(1)/S transition during the cell cycle is accelerated by both the Kit/Stat5 and Kit/PI3K/Akt pathways. The combined use of the clinically relevant drugs NVP-BEZ235, which targets the cell cycle, and Obatoclax, which targets survival, demonstrated synergistic effects to inhibit leukemia cell growth. This synergy was confirmed with a human mast leukemia cell line (HMC-1.2) that expresses mutant Kit.

CADM1 is expressed in alternatively spliced isoforms, but those present in HLMCs and their function are not known. We cloned three functional and one cryptic non-functional isoform with alternative splicing between exons 7/11 and 1/2, respectively, from HLMCs and human MC lines (HMC-1 and LAD2). Differentiated HLMCs and LAD2 cells expressed the functional isoform SP4 containing exons 7/8/11 (~80% of clones), as well as SP1 (exons 7/8/9/11) and a novel SP6 (exons 7/8/9/10/11). In contrast, immature HMC-1 cells expressed only functional SP4. SP4 overexpression in HMC-1 cells and HLMCs augmented homotypic adhesion to a greater extent than SP1 in various conditions. In contrast, CADM1 downregulation abolished homotypic adhesion, indicating that CADM1 is the sole receptor mediating mast cell aggregation. CADM1-mediated adhesion was enhanced by the presence of cell survival factors. SP1 overexpression in HMC-1 cells compromised survival compared to SP4 overexpression or control. CADM1 downregulation resulted in reduced viability and decreased expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1(L), but not Blc-2 or Bcl-X(L), and increased caspase-3/7 activity in both HMC-1 cells and HLMCs. This coincided with decreased basal Kit levels in HLMCs. In summary, human MCs express multiple CADM1 isoforms which exhibit differential regulation of survival and homotypic adhesion. The most highly expressed SP4 isoform is likely to contribute to MC aggregation and longevity in mastocytosis, and augment the pathophysiology of allergic diseases.",,"['Moiseeva, Elena P', 'Leyland, Mark L', 'Bradding, Peter']","['Moiseeva EP', 'Leyland ML', 'Bradding P']","['Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, Institute for Lung Health, Clinical Sciences Wing, Glenfield Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester LE3 9QP, UK. em9@le.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120322,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lung/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-012-0948-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2012 Aug;69(16):2751-64. doi: 10.1007/s00018-012-0948-y.

Besides a short introduction of CL and EMF, our article gives an evaluation of the evidence of a causal relation between EMF and CL by critically appraising the epidemiological and biological evidence. The potential impact is also estimated by the population attributable risk. The etiology of CL is largely unknown, but is probably multifactorial. EMF may be one of the environmental exposures involved. Three pooled analyses of case-control studies showed a 1.4- to 1.7-fold increased CL risk for extremely low-frequency EMF (ELF-EMF) exposure levels above 0.3 muT. Several biases may have played a role in these studies, but are unlikely to fully explain the increased risk. For effects of radiofrequency ELF evidence is lacking. None of the proposed biological mechanisms by which ELF-EMF might cause CL have been confirmed. The estimated overall population attributable risk was 1.9%, with the highest estimates in Northern America and Brazil (4.2% and 4.1%, respectively). The potential impact of EMF exposure on public health is probably limited, although in some countries exposure might be relatively high and thus might have a more substantial impact. We recommend nationwide surveys to gain more insight into the contemporary exposure levels among children. Reducing exposure from power lines near densely populated areas and schools is advised.

This classification has prognostic significance, but GEP is expensive and not readily applicable into daily practice, which has lead to immunohistochemical algorithms proposed as a surrogate for GEP analysis. We assembled tissue microarrays from 475 de novo DLBCL patients who were treated with rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy. All cases were successfully profiled by GEP on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Sections were stained with antibodies reactive with CD10, GCET1, FOXP1, MUM1 and BCL6 and cases were classified following a rationale of sequential steps of differentiation of B cells. Cutoffs for each marker were obtained using receiver-operating characteristic curves, obviating the need for any arbitrary method. An algorithm based on the expression of CD10, FOXP1 and BCL6 was developed that had a simpler structure than other recently proposed algorithms and 92.6% concordance with GEP. In multivariate analysis, both the International Prognostic Index and our proposed algorithm were significant independent predictors of progression-free and overall survival. In conclusion, this algorithm effectively predicts prognosis of DLBCL patients matching GEP subgroups in the era of rituximab therapy.",,"['Visco, C', 'Li, Y', 'Xu-Monette, Z Y', 'Miranda, R N', 'Green, T M', 'Li, Y', 'Tzankov, A', 'Wen, W', 'Liu, W-m', 'Kahl, B S', ""d'Amore, E S G"", 'Montes-Moreno, S', 'Dybkaer, K', 'Chiu, A', 'Tam, W', 'Orazi, A', 'Zu, Y', 'Bhagat, G', 'Winter, J N', 'Wang, H-Y', ""O'Neill, S"", 'Dunphy, C H', 'Hsi, E D', 'Zhao, X F', 'Go, R S', 'Choi, W W L', 'Zhou, F', 'Czader, M', 'Tong, J', 'Zhao, X', 'van Krieken, J H', 'Huang, Q', 'Ai, W', 'Etzell, J', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Ferreri, A J M', 'Piris, M A', 'Moller, M B', 'Bueso-Ramos, C E', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Wu, L', 'Young, K H']","['Visco C', 'Li Y', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Miranda RN', 'Green TM', 'Li Y', 'Tzankov A', 'Wen W', 'Liu WM', 'Kahl BS', ""d'Amore ES"", 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Dybkaer K', 'Chiu A', 'Tam W', 'Orazi A', 'Zu Y', 'Bhagat G', 'Winter JN', 'Wang HY', ""O'Neill S"", 'Dunphy CH', 'Hsi ED', 'Zhao XF', 'Go RS', 'Choi WW', 'Zhou F', 'Czader M', 'Tong J', 'Zhao X', 'van Krieken JH', 'Huang Q', 'Ai W', 'Etzell J', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Piris MA', 'Moller MB', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wu L', 'Young KH']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120322,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*classification/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2012/03/23 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201283 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2103-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.83.

Differences in the induction of costimulatory molecules and/or apoptosis were observed in mutated versus unmutated CLL. Different responses were also identified in subsets with stereotyped BcRs, underscoring the idea that ""subset-biased"" innate immunity responses may occur independently of mutational status. Additionally, differential modulation of kinase activities was induced by TLR stimulation of different CLL subgroups, revealing a TLR7-tolerant state for cases belonging to stereotyped subset #4.

Retroviral proteases (PRs) are essential for viral replication by processing viral Gag and Gag-(Pro)-Pol polyproteins during maturation. Full-length HTLV-1 PR is 125 residues long; whether the C-terminal region is required for catalytic activity is still controversial. In this study, we characterized the effect of C-terminal amino acids of HTLV-1 PR for PR activity and examined the binding of compounds identified by in silico screening. One compound showed inhibition against the virus in infected cells. METHODS: Truncated (116-, 121- and 122-residue) forms of HTLV-1 PR were prepared and proteins from expression of the genes were purified. In silico screening was performed by docking small molecules into the active site of HTLV-1 PR. The kinetic constants k(cat), K(m), k(cat)/K(m) and inhibition constants K(i) for inhibitors identified by the computational screening were determined. Western blot and ELISA analyses were used to determine the effect of the most potent PR inhibitors on HTLV-1 protein processing in infected cells. RESULTS: The constructs showed similar catalytic efficiency constants (k(cat)/K(m)); thus HTLV-1 PR C-terminal amino acids are not essential for full activity. Computational screening revealed new PR inhibitors and some were shown to be inhibitory in enzyme assays. In HTLV-1-infected cells, one of the small molecules inhibited HTLV-1 gag cleavage and decreased the amount of HTLV-1 p19 produced in the cells. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified an HTLV-1 PR inhibitor that is biologically functional. Inhibitor screening will continue to develop possible drugs for therapy of HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Demir, Ahu', 'Oguariri, Raphael M', 'Magis, Andrew', 'Ostrov, David A', 'Imamichi, Tomozumi', 'Dunn, Ben M']","['Demir A', 'Oguariri RM', 'Magis A', 'Ostrov DA', 'Imamichi T', 'Dunn BM']","['University of Florida College of Medicine Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120321,England,Antivir Ther,Antiviral therapy,9815705,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HTLV-1 protease)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/chemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protease Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology']",2012/03/23 06:00,2013/01/16 06:00,['2012/03/23 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3851/IMP2090 [doi]'],ppublish,Antivir Ther. 2012;17(5):883-92. doi: 10.3851/IMP2090.

Perfection in image segmentation is a necessary condition for improving the diagnostic accuracy in automated cytology. Even though much effort has been put in developing suitable segmentation routines, the problem still remains open in areas like pathological imaging. Clustering is an essential image segmentation procedure which segments an image into desired regions. This paper introduces a novel Shadowed C-means (SCM) clustering approach towards leukocyte segmentation in blood microscopic images. The segmented nucleus and cytoplasm of a leukocyte can be used for feature extraction which can lead to acute leukemia detection. Absence of parameter tuning in SCM with acceptable segmentation performance gives the proposed scheme an edge over standard cluster based segmentation techniques.

We hypothesized that maternal plasma concentrations of certain cytokines at the time of embryo transfer could predict the likelihood of successful implantation and pregnancy. sIL-2R, IL-6, LIF, and MMP2 concentrations were measured in plasma from 160 IVF patients (natural and stimulated IVF cycles) on the morning of the embryo transfer (ET0) and 14 days later (ET+14). Patients were ultimately subdivided into four groups depending on the IVF treatment outcome (pregnancy failure, biochemical pregnancy, first-trimester miscarriage and normal term delivery). In natural and stimulated IVF cycles at ET0, sIL-2R concentrations were threefold higher in biochemical pregnancies than in pregnancy failures (P=0.020), and in natural cycles only, 2.5-fold higher in normal term deliveries than in pregnancy failures (P=0.023). Conversely, in natural and stimulated IVF cycles at ET0, LIF concentrations were one third lower in biochemical pregnancies/first-trimester miscarriages compared with pregnancy failures (P=0.042). We suggest that high sIL-2R and low LIF concentrations in maternal plasma on the morning of the embryo transfer might be associated with increased risks of early pregnancy loss, while a basal level of sIL-2R is necessary for normal term delivery outcome. Both cytokine measurements might therefore be useful in the management of IVF patients, and modulation of their concentrations could be investigated as a therapeutic alternative for women with abnormal concentrations at the time of embryo transfer.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

HIV type 1 (HIV-1) does not infect Old World monkeys, such as the rhesus monkey (Rh). Rh TRIM5alpha was identified as a factor that confers resistance, intrinsic immunity, to HIV-1 infection. Unfortunately, human TRIM5alpha is almost powerless to restrict HIV-1. However, human TRIM5alpha potently restricts N-tropic murine leukemia viruses (MLV) but not B-tropic MLV, indicating that human TRIM5alpha represents the restriction factor previously designated as Ref1. African green monkey TRIM5alpha represents another restriction factor previously designated as Lv1, which restricts both HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from macaque (SIVmac) infection. TRIM5 is a member of the tripartite motif family containing RING, B-box2, and coiled-coil domains. The RING domain is frequently found in E3 ubiquitin ligase, and TRIM5alpha is thought to degrade viral core via ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways. The alpha isoform of TRIM5 has an additional C-terminal PRYSPRY domain, which is a determinant of species-specific retrovirus restriction by TRIM5alpha. On the other hand, the target regions of viral capsid protein (CA) are scattered on the surface of core. A single amino acid difference in the surface-exposed loop between alpha-helices 6 and 7 (L6/7) of HIV type 2 (HIV-2) CA affects viral sensitivity to human TRIM5alpha and was also shown to be associated with viral load in West African HIV-2 patients, indicating that human TRIM5alpha is a critical modulator of HIV-2 replication in vivo. Interestingly, L6/7 of CA corresponds to the MLV determinant of sensitivity to mouse factor Fv1, which potently restricts N-tropic MLV. In addition, human genetic polymorphisms also affect antiviral activity of human TRIM5alpha. Recently, human TRIM5alpha was shown to activate signaling pathways that lead to activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 by interacting with TAK1 complex. TRIM5alpha is thus involved in control of viral infection in multiple ways.",,"['Nakayama, Emi E', 'Shioda, Tatsuo']","['Nakayama EE', 'Shioda T']","['Department of Viral Infections, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120315,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2012/03/22 06:00,2012/03/22 06:01,['2012/03/22 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00097 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Mar 15;3:97. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00097. eCollection 2012.,,,,,PMC3304089,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fv1', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-2', 'SIV', 'TAB2', 'TRIM5alpha', 'TRIMCyp', 'capsid']",,,,,,,,

This activity is responsible for acetylation of several sites on the histones as well as modification of transcription factors. In a previous study, we found that HBZ, encoded by the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV-1), binds to multiple domains of p300/CBP, including the HAT domain. In this study, we found that HBZ inhibits the HAT activity of p300/CBP through the bZIP domain of the viral protein. This effect correlated with a reduction of H3K18 acetylation, a specific target of p300/CBP, in cells expressing HBZ. Interestingly, lower levels of H3K18 acetylation were detected in HTLV-1 infected cells compared to non-infected cells. The inhibitory effect of HBZ was not limited to histones, as HBZ also inhibited acetylation of the NF-kappaB subunit, p65, and the tumor suppressor, p53. Recent studies reported that mutations in the HAT domain of p300/CBP that cause a defect in acetylation are found in certain types of leukemia. These observations suggest that inhibition of the HAT activity by HBZ is important for the development of adult T-cell leukemia associated with HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Wurm, Torsten', 'Wright, Diana G', 'Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Wurm T', 'Wright DG', 'Polakowski N', 'Mesnard JM', 'Lemasson I']","['East Carolina University, Brody School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120319,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",2012/03/22 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/03/22 06:00'],"['2012/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gks244 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gks244 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jul;40(13):5910-25. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks244.

Survival in ALL has improved in recent decades due to recognition of its biological heterogeneity. Although children have higher remission and cure rates than adults, both populations have benefited from these improvements. Our aim in this study is to determine the association between HLA-DQB1 genes with childhood and adult ALL patients. To define this association, we compared HLA-DQB1 allele frequencies and allele carrier frequencies in a cohort of 135 adults and children with ALL with 150 controls, using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. Allele carrier frequencies in childhood ALL show a deficiency in DQ2 (*0201) (P 0.049 and RR 0.75), but an increase in DQ5 (*0501-*0504) and DQ7 (*0301, *0304) compared to the control group (P 0.001 RR 1.89, P 0.003 RR 1.48, respectively). Allele carrier frequencies in adult ALL indicated an increase in DQ5 (*0501-*0504) (P0.045 RR 2.28). Allelic frequencies in childhood ALL revealed the same increase in DQ5 and DQ7, and a decrease in DQ2. In adult ALL it shows a decrease in DQ7. Therefore, our results in adult ALL were similar to childhood ALL addressing DQ5 allele carriers, which showed an increase in both age groups. We suggest that DQ5 could be more strongly considered as an ALL susceptibility allele, and that this allele may underlie a pathogenic phenotype with a major role in the immunologic process involved in both adults and children with ALL.",,"['Orouji, Elias', 'Tavakkol Afshari, Jalil', 'Badiee, Zahra', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Alipour, Afrouz']","['Orouji E', 'Tavakkol Afshari J', 'Badiee Z', 'Shirdel A', 'Alipour A']","['Department of Immunogenetics, BuAli Research Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), BuAli Square, Mashhad, Iran. elias.orouji@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120321,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (HLA-DQ beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DQB1 antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'HLA-DQ beta-Chains/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/22 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/03/22 06:00'],"['2011/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1051-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 May;95(5):551-5. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1051-8.

The extreme heterogeneity poses difficulties for understanding and treating BC. Among many risk factors, inflammation plays a causal role in BC progression and recurrence, wherein NFkB and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are critical transcription factors in regulating inflammation. NFkB is generally pro-inflammatory, and GR is anti-inflammatory, constituting a Yin-Yang mode in regulation. Thus, the crosstalk between these two transcription factors exerts even more important functions in determining the survival or apoptosis of BC cells. NFkB is widely involved in the initiation and progression of BC; its inhibitors are emerging as a potent primary or adjuvant therapy. On the other hand, glucocorticoids (GCs) are already used as neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapies to treat various cancers with remarkable effects to induce apoptosis in leukemia and lymphoma. However, GCs unexpectedly promote cancer cell survival and induce chemo-resistance in BC. To understand this unique transcriptional interplay in BC, in this review we discuss the functions of NFkB and GR in BC development and progression by emphasizing their cross talk at cell signaling and protein interaction levels; and the future perspectives are proposed for the development of new therapeutic approaches for BC based on these signaling pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to estimate the risk and its changes over time of developing SPC among prostate cancer patients compared with the general male population in Bavaria, southern Germany. Utilizing data from the Population-Based Cancer Registry Bavaria, the risk of SPC was evaluated in 59 259 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2008 who contributed 159 892 person-years. The relative and absolute risk of developing SPC were calculated using the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and the excess absolute risk. Changes in the risk were examined by plotting the SIR and its 95% confidence interval against time after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The overall risk of SPC was significantly increased by 14% compared with the general male population. With regard to specific cancer types, a significantly increased risk of SPC was found for the urinary bladder, kidney, pancreas, melanoma of skin, leukemia, myeloma, brain/nervous system, renal pelvis/ureter, thyroid, and the small intestine. The absolute risk of SPC for most cancer types, however, was below 10 cases per 10 000 person-years. A significantly decreased risk of SPC was found in the lung/bronchus and the liver.

METHODS: Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to detect CpG island methylation density in EphB4 promoter. The expression of EphB4 mRNA and protein was determined by Q-PCR and Western blot. MTS assay and flow cytometry were used to detect the apoptosis of CEM cells after treatment with different concentrations of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (1.0, 2.5 and 5 mumol/L). RESULTS: Methylation of EphB4 gene promoter was detected in CEM cells (31.4%).

Recently, two infants presented with leukemia cutis isolated to the skin requiring TSEI. This work discusses the commissioning and quality assurance (QA) methods for implementing a modified Stanford technique using a rotating harness system to position sedated pediatric patients treated with electrons to the total skin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Commissioning of pediatric TSEI consisted of absolute calibration, measurement of dosimetric parameters, and subsequent verification in a pediatric patient sized cylindrical phantom using radiographic film and optically stimulated luminance (OSL) dosimeters. The depth of dose penetration under TSEI treatment condition was evaluated using radiographic film sandwiched in the phantom and demonstrated a 2 cm penetration depth with the maximum dose located at the phantom surface. Dosimetry measurements on the cylindrical phantom and in-vivo measurements from the patients suggested that, the factor relating the skin and calibration point doses (i.e., the B-factor) was larger for the pediatric TSEI treatments as compared to adult TSEI treatments. Custom made equipment, including a rotating plate and harness, was fabricated and added to a standard total body irradiation stand and tested to facilitate patient setup under sedated condition. A pediatric TSEI QA program, consisting of daily output, energy, flatness, and symmetry measurements as well as in-vivo dosimetry verification for the first cycle was developed. With a long interval between pediatric TSEI cases, absolute dosimetry was also repeated as part of the QA program. In-vivo dosimetry for the first two infants showed that a dose of +/- 10% of the prescription dose can be achieved over the entire patient body. CONCLUSION: Though pediatric leukemia cutis and the subsequent need for TSEI are rare, the ability to commission the technique on a modified TBI stand is appealing for clinical implementation and has been successfully used for the treatment of two pediatric patients at our institution.",,"['Bao, Qinan', 'Hrycushko, Brian A', 'Dugas, Joseph P', 'Hager, Frederick H', 'Solberg, Timothy D']","['Bao Q', 'Hrycushko BA', 'Dugas JP', 'Hager FH', 'Solberg TD']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5801 Forest Park Rd, Dallas, TX 75390, USA. qinan.bao@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120320,England,Radiat Oncol,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",101265111,,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electrons/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Radiation Oncology/instrumentation/methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, High-Energy/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Skin/*radiation effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*instrumentation/*methods']",2012/03/22 06:00,2012/08/09 06:00,['2012/03/22 06:00'],"['2011/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1748-717X-7-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1748-717X-7-40 [doi]']",epublish,Radiat Oncol. 2012 Mar 20;7:40. doi: 10.1186/1748-717X-7-40.,,,,,PMC3349519,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of PDGF receptors occurs in myeloid malignancies associated with hypereosinophilia, due to chromosomal alterations that produce fusion genes, such as ETV6-PDGFRB or FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Most patients are males and respond to low dose imatinib, which is particularly effective against PDGF receptor kinase activity. Recently, activating point mutations in PDGFRA were also described in hypereosinophilia. In addition, autocrine loops have been identified in large granular lymphocyte leukemia and HTLV-transformed lymphocytes, suggesting new possible indications for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Although PDGF was initially purified from platelets more than 30 years ago, its physiological role in the hematopoietic system remains unclear. Hematopoietic defects in PDGF-deficient mice have been reported but appear to be secondary to cardiovascular and placental abnormalities. Nevertheless, PDGF acts directly on several hematopoietic cell types in vitro, such as megakaryocytes, platelets, activated macrophages and, possibly, certain lymphocyte subsets and eosinophils.

A FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, found in approximately a quarter of patients with de novo AML, imparts a particularly poor prognosis. Patients with FLT3-ITD AML often present with more aggressive disease and have a significantly higher propensity for relapse after remission. The therapeutic approach for these patients has traditionally included intensive induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidative chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In recent years, multiple small molecule inhibitors of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase have been studied preclinically and in clinical trials. The earlier generation of these agents, often non-specific and impacting a variety of tyrosine kinases, produced at best transient peripheral blood responses in early clinical trials. Additionally, the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with cytotoxic regimens has not, as of yet, demonstrated an improvement in overall survival. Nevertheless, multiple current trials, including those with sorafenib, lestaurtinib, and midostaurin, continue to study the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with standard chemotherapy. Factors such as sustained FLT3 inhibition, protein binding, pharmacokinetics, and the presence of elevated FLT3-ligand levels appear to significantly impact the potency of these agents in vivo. In recent years, the development of more specific and potent agents has generated hope that FLT3 inhibitors may play a more prominent role in the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML in the near future. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the optimal timing and schedule for incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors. The suitability, type, and timing of allogeneic HCT in the therapeutic approach for these patients are also issues which require further study and definition. Recent retrospective data appears to support the efficacy of allogeneic HCT in first complete remission, possibly due to a graft versus leukemia effect. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to further elucidate the role of HCT and its potential combination with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We are hopeful that current clinical investigation will lead to an optimization and improvement of outcomes for these patients.",,"['Fathi, Amir T', 'Chen, Yi-Bin']","['Fathi AT', 'Chen YB']","['Center for Leukemia and the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110909,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2011/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Blood Res. 2011;1(2):175-89.

Experimental results show, however, that DLI efficacy is strongly dependent on the number of donor hematopoietic cells persisting in recipient after transplantation. It is strong in mixed chimeras and relatively weak in full chimeras (FC) that replace host antigen-presenting cells by donor antigen-presenting cells. In this study we applied a new in vivo cytotoxicity monitoring method for evaluation of the changes in FC anti-host immunity after co-transplantation of donor and host hematopoietic cells together. METHOD: Full hematopoietic chimeras and naive control mice were transplanted with a mixture of equivalent numbers of donor and recipient or donor and third party splenocytes labeled by a cell-permeable fluorescent dye CFDA-SE. The animals were sacrificed at various time points, and their splenocyte suspensions were prepared, depleted of red blood cells, stained with allophycocyanin-labeled anti-H2(b) antibodies, and analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The immune response was assessed according to the percentage of single positive CFDA-SE(+)/ H2(b-) cells of all CFDA-SE(+) cells. RESULTS: FC grafted with splenocytes from similar FC mixed with splenocytes from naive host-type or third-party-type mice rejected host cells within 14 days, and third-party cells within 7 days. NK cell depletion in vivo had no influence on host cell rejection kinetics. Co-infusion of host-type splenocytes with splenocytes obtained from naive donor-type mice resulted in significant acceleration of host cell rejection (10 days). Naive mice rejected the same amount of allogeneic lymphocytes within 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed method provides a simple and sensitive tool to evaluate in vivo post-transplant cytotoxicity in different experimental settings. The method demonstrates that FC is specifically deficient in their ability to reject host lymphocytes even when antigen-presenting host cells are provided. DLI improve anti-host immune response in FC but can not restore it to the level observed in naive donor-type mice.",,"['Elkin, Gregory', 'Prigozhina, Tatyana B', 'Slavin, Shimon', 'Gurevitch, Olga', 'Khitrin, Sofia', 'Resnick, Igor B']","['Elkin G', 'Prigozhina TB', 'Slavin S', 'Gurevitch O', 'Khitrin S', 'Resnick IB']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110822,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Blood Res. 2011;1(2):110-8.

Translocations involving immunoglobulin genes are recurrent, but uncommon (<5%), and their individual prognosis is not clear. The two most frequent partners are BCL2 (18q21) and BCL3 (19q13). DESIGNS AND METHODS: Herein, 75 cases are reported of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and t(14;18) (BCL2-CLLs). Our series benefits from morphological, immunological and cytogenetical reviews. The IGHV status analyses were performed by referring laboratories. Comparison was made with our previously published series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with t(14;19) (BCL3-CLLs, n=29). RESULTS: Compared with BCL3-CLLs, lymphocytosis was lower in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.008), and splenomegaly was less frequent (p<0.0001). There were more ""typical"" morphologies (p<0.005) and Matutes scores >4 (p<0.001) in the BCL2-CLLs group, and less CD38 expression (p<0.04). More variant BCL2-translocations were observed (t(18;22), n=11; 2t(2;18), n=2; p<0.02), and BCL2-translocation was frequently single (p<0.002). Complex karyotypes (p<0.02), trisomy 12 (p<0.03), 6q deletion (p<0.002) and TP53 deletion (p<0.02) were less frequent in BCL2-CLLs, whereas 13q deletion was more frequent (p<0.005). The IGHV gene was frequently mutated in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.0001). Treatment-free survival was longer in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: BCL2-CLL.S express CD5 and lack expression of CD38, and have a Matutes score >/=4, frequent trisomy 12, no ATM and 6q deletions, and a mutated IGHV status. Compared to BCL3-CLLs, BCL2-CLLs are much less aggressive; indicating that identifying individual translocations and cytogenetic partners would allow improved patient stratification.",,"['Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Lesty, Claude', 'Grelier, Aurore', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Lefebvre, Christine', 'Fert-Ferrer, Sandra', 'Callet-Bauchu, Evelyne', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Raggueneau, Victoria', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Barin, Carole', 'Collonge-Rame, Marie-Agnes', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Eclache, Virginie', 'Taviaux, Sylvie', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Richebourg, Steven', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Talmant, Pascaline', 'Baranger, Laurence', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Gervais, Carine', 'Quilichini, Benoit', 'Settegrana, Catherine', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Merle-Beral, Helene']","['Nguyen-Khac F', 'Chapiro E', 'Lesty C', 'Grelier A', 'Luquet I', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Lefebvre C', 'Fert-Ferrer S', 'Callet-Bauchu E', 'Lippert E', 'Raggueneau V', 'Michaux L', 'Barin C', 'Collonge-Rame MA', 'Mugneret F', 'Eclache V', 'Taviaux S', 'Dastugue N', 'Richebourg S', 'Struski S', 'Talmant P', 'Baranger L', 'Gachard N', 'Gervais C', 'Quilichini B', 'Settegrana C', 'Maloum K', 'Davi F', 'Merle-Beral H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110415,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2011/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Blood Res. 2011;1(1):13-21.

Chromosomal translocations mostly result in the expression of chimeric fusion proteins associated with enhanced proliferation and/or malignant transformation. Here, we demonstrate that genes frequently involved in such genetic rearrangements exhibit a unique feature: premature transcriptional termination. These early-terminated RNA molecules have an abundance of 10-20% when compared to their cognate full-length transcripts. They exhibit an unsaturated splice donor site that gives rise to trans-splicing events, leading to RNAs displaying exon repetitions or chimeric fusion RNAs. These arbitrary fusion RNAs mimic the presence of a chromosomal translocation in genetically unaffected cells. Based on our and published data, we propose the hypothesis that these artificial ""chimeric fusion transcripts"" may influence DNA repair processes, resulting in the generation of de novo chromosomal translocations.

Although previous candidate genetic studies have identified mutations in MPN patients who develop acute leukemia, the complement of genetic abnormalities in MPN patients who undergo LT is not known nor have specific molecular abnormalities been shown to have clinical relevance in this setting. We performed high-throughput resequencing of 22 genes in 53 patients with LT after MPN to characterize the frequency of known myeloid mutations in this entity. In addition to JAK2 and TET2 mutations, which occur commonly in LT after MPN, we identified recurrent mutations in the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) gene (18.9%) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformed from MPNs. SRSF2 mutations are more common in AML derived from MPNs compared with LT after myelodysplasia (4.8%) or de novo AML (5.6%), respectively (P=.05). Importantly, SRSF2 mutations are associated with worsened overall survival in MPN patients who undergo LT in univariate (P=.03; HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.10-7.00) and multivariate analysis (P<.05; HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.01-4.42).

Key to eradicating LSCs is to identify genes that play a critical role in survival regulation of these stem cells. Using BCR-ABL-induced CML mouse model, here we show that expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) gene is downregulated in LSCs and that Scd1 plays a tumor-suppressive role in LSCs with no effect on the function of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Deletion of Scd1 causes acceleration of CML development and conversely overexpression of Scd1 delays CML development. In addition, using genetic approaches, we show that Pten, p53, and Bcl2 are regulated by Scd1 in LSCs. Furthermore, we find that induction of Scd1 expression by a PPARgamma agonist suppresses LSCs and delays CML development. Our results demonstrate a critical role for Scd1 in functional regulation of LSCs, providing a new anti-LSC strategy through enhancing Scd1 activity.",,"['Zhang, Haojian', 'Li, Huawei', 'Ho, Ngoc', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Zhang H', 'Li H', 'Ho N', 'Li D', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (PPAR gamma)', 'EC 1.14.19.1 (Scd1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.19.1 (Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'PPAR gamma/agonists/metabolism', 'Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase/*genetics']",2012/03/21 06:00,2013/07/06 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.05672-11 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.05672-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2012 May;32(10):1776-87. doi: 10.1128/MCB.05672-11.

In an attempt to make thiaminase I a more effective pharmaceutical agent, we have modified it by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of various lengths. We were surprised to find that 5k-PEGylation eliminated thiaminase cytotoxic activity in all cell lines tested. Both native thiaminase and 5k-PEGylated thiaminase efficiently depleted thiamine from cell culture medium, and both could use intracellular phosphorylated thiamine as substrates. However, native enzyme more effectively depleted thiamine and thiamine diphosphate in RS4 leukemia cell cytosol, and native thiaminase depressed cellular respiration, whereas PEGylated thiaminase did not. Despite the lack of in vitro cytotoxicity, PEGylation markedly increased the in vivo toxicity of the enzyme. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the half-life of native thiaminase was 1.5 h compared with 34.4 h for the 5k-PEGylated enzyme. Serum thiamine levels were depleted by both native and 5k-PEGylated enzyme. Despite superior pharmacokinetics, 5k-PEGylated thiaminase showed no antitumor effect against an RS4 leukemia xenograft, in contrast to native thiaminase, which showed antitumor activity. PEGylation of thiaminase I has demonstrated that depression of mitochondrial function contributes, at least in part, to its anticancer activity. PEGylation also enhances plasma retention time, which increased its vivo toxicity and decreased its activity against a leukemia xenograft, the opposite of the desired effects. These studies suggest that the mechanism of anticancer cytotoxicity of thiaminase requires acute depression of cellular respiration, whereas systemic toxicity is related to the duration of extracellular thiamine depletion.",,"['Liu, Shuqian', 'Bae, Younsoo', 'Leggas, Markos', 'Daily, Abigail', 'Bhatnagar, Saloni', 'Miriyala, Sumitra', 'St Clair, Daret K', 'Moscow, Jeffrey A']","['Liu S', 'Bae Y', 'Leggas M', 'Daily A', 'Bhatnagar S', 'Miriyala S', 'St Clair DK', 'Moscow JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.2 (thiamin pyridinylase)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Bacillus/*enzymology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/physiology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Thiamine/*metabolism']",2012/03/21 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.112.191817 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.112.191817 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2012 Jun;341(3):775-83. doi: 10.1124/jpet.112.191817.

Among the RASSF genes, RASSF1A is one of the most frequently methylated genes in a wide range of epithelial cancers, and we previously demonstrated that RASSF6 and RASSF10 genes are frequently epigenetically inactivated in acute leukemias, particularly in those of the B cell type. We here determined the methylation profiles of all members of the RASSF gene family as well as two recently identified (KIBRA, CRB3) upstream members of the SWH pathway in the leukemic B cells obtained from a well-characterized cohort of 95 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Among the RASSF genes, RASSF10 (50%) was the most frequently methylated gene, followed by RASSF6 (16%). The remaining RASSF genes were either unmethylated or showed a frequency of methylation < 10%. The upstream SWH member KIBRA was also frequently methylated in CLL (35%) in contrast to CRB3.

It was also shown that CD19(+) clonotypic B cells can serve as MM progenitor cells in some patients. However, it is unclear whether CD138-negative clonogenic MM plasma cells are identical to clonotypic CD19(+) B cells. We found that in vitro MM colony-forming cells were enriched in CD138(-)CD19(-)CD38(++) plasma cells, while CD19(+) B cells never formed MM colonies in 16 samples examined in this study. We next used the SCID-rab model, which enables engraftment of human MM in vivo. CD138(-)CD19(-)CD38(++) plasma cells engrafted in this model rapidly propagated MM in 3 out of 9 cases, while no engraftment of CD19(+) B cells was detected. In 4 out of 9 cases, CD138(+) plasma cells propagated MM, although more slowly than CD138(-) cells. Finally, we transplanted CD19(+) B cells from 13 MM patients into NOD/SCID IL2Rgammac(-/-) mice, but MM did not develop. These results suggest that at least in some MM patients CD138-negative clonogenic cells are plasma cells rather than B cells, and that MM plasma cells including CD138(-) and CD138(+) cells have the potential to propagate MM clones in vivo in the absence of CD19(+) B cells.",,"['Hosen, N', 'Matsuoka, Y', 'Kishida, S', 'Nakata, J', 'Mizutani, Y', 'Hasegawa, K', 'Mugitani, A', 'Ichihara, H', 'Aoyama, Y', 'Nishida, S', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Fujiki, F', 'Tatsumi, N', 'Nakajima, H', 'Hino, M', 'Kimura, T', 'Yata, K', 'Abe, M', 'Oka, Y', 'Oji, Y', 'Kumanogoh, A', 'Sugiyama, H']","['Hosen N', 'Matsuoka Y', 'Kishida S', 'Nakata J', 'Mizutani Y', 'Hasegawa K', 'Mugitani A', 'Ichihara H', 'Aoyama Y', 'Nishida S', 'Tsuboi A', 'Fujiki F', 'Tatsumi N', 'Nakajima H', 'Hino M', 'Kimura T', 'Yata K', 'Abe M', 'Oka Y', 'Oji Y', 'Kumanogoh A', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120320,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Rabbits', 'Syndecan-1/*metabolism']",2012/03/21 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201280 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.80 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2135-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.80.

Moreover, C3B3 suppressed colony formation and tumorigenesis of SP cells in vitro and in vivo. Crosslinking of HLA class I by C3B3 mediated disruption of lipid rafts and actin aggregation, which led to inhibition of gene expression of beta-catenin and pluripotency-associated transcription factors such as Sox2, Oct3/4 and Nanog. Conversely, knockdown of Sox2 and Oct3/4 mRNA reduced the proportion of SP cells, suggesting that these factors are essential in maintenance of SP fraction in MM cells. Thus, our findings reveal that immunotherapeutic approach by engineered antibodies can overcome drug resistance, and provide a new basis for development of cancer stem cell-targeted therapy.",,"['Ikegame, A', 'Ozaki, S', 'Tsuji, D', 'Harada, T', 'Fujii, S', 'Nakamura, S', 'Miki, H', 'Nakano, A', 'Kagawa, K', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Abe, M', 'Watanabe, K', 'Hiasa, M', 'Kimura, N', 'Kikuchi, Y', 'Sakamoto, A', 'Habu, K', 'Endo, M', 'Itoh, K', 'Yamada-Okabe, H', 'Matsumoto, T']","['Ikegame A', 'Ozaki S', 'Tsuji D', 'Harada T', 'Fujii S', 'Nakamura S', 'Miki H', 'Nakano A', 'Kagawa K', 'Takeuchi K', 'Abe M', 'Watanabe K', 'Hiasa M', 'Kimura N', 'Kikuchi Y', 'Sakamoto A', 'Habu K', 'Endo M', 'Itoh K', 'Yamada-Okabe H', 'Matsumoto T']","['Department of Medicine and Bioregulatory Sciences, University of Tokushima Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120320,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Side-Population Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2012/03/21 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201278 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.78 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2124-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.78.

To date, there is increasing evidence for a functional role of TET2 mutations (TET2(mut)) in AML. Thus, we explored the frequency, gene-expression pattern, and clinical impact of TET2(mut) in a large cohort of patients with AML in the context of other AML-associated aberrations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 783 younger adult patients with AML were analyzed for the presence of TET2(mut) (coding exons 3 to 11), and results were correlated with data from molecular genetic analyses, gene-expression profiling, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In total, 66 TET2(mut) were found in 60 patients (60 of 783 patients; 7.6%), including missense (n = 37), frameshift (n = 16), and nonsense (n = 13) mutations, which, with one exception, were all heterozygous. TET2(mut) were not correlated with distinct clinical features or genetic alterations, except for isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (IDH(mut)) that were almost mutually exclusive with TET2(mut) (P < .001). TET2(mut) were characterized by only a weak gene-expression pattern, which, nevertheless, reflected TET2(mut)-associated biology. TET2(mut) did not impact the response to induction therapy and clinical outcome; the combination of patients who exhibited TET2(mut) and/or IDH(mut) revealed shorter overall survival (P = .03), although this association was not independent from known risk factors. CONCLUSION: TET2(mut) were identified in 7.6% of younger adult patients with AML and did not impact the response to therapy and survival. Mutations were mutually exclusive with IDH(mut), which supported recent data on a common mechanism of action that might obscure the impact of TET2(mut) if compared against all other patients with AML.",,"['Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Habdank, Marianne', 'Kohne, Claus-Henning', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Held, Gerhard', 'Horst, Heinz-August', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Bentz, Martin', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Gaidzik VI', 'Paschka P', 'Spath D', 'Habdank M', 'Kohne CH', 'Germing U', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Held G', 'Horst HA', 'Haase D', 'Bentz M', 'Gotze K', 'Dohner H', 'Schlenk RF', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K']","['Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/21 06:00,2012/06/15 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.39.2886 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.39.2886 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Apr 20;30(12):1350-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.2886.

Ten patients (11.6%) were MRD-positive, and 76 were MRD-negative (88.4%). Most of the patients (82%) received myeloablative conditioning. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. In multivariate analysis, age, disease status (complete remission [CR] 1 versus CR2/CR3), disease group (precursor B cell ALL versus Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL versus T cell ALL), and time to transplantation had no impact on relapse. Patients with MRD before UCBT had a greater incidence of relapse at 2 years (relapse rate, 30%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-56%) and lower 3-year disease-free survival (30%; 95% CI, 7%-58%) compared with those without MRD (relapse rate, 16%; 95% CI, 8%-25%; P = .05; disease-free survival, 55%; 95% CI, 43%-66%; P = .02).

The donor sources for salvage HSCT were cord blood (n = 180), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs; n = 24), and bone marrow (BM; n = 16). The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment on day 30 after the second HSCT was 39% with CB, 71% with PBSCs, and 75% with BM. Multivariate analysis revealed that PBSC and BM grafts were associated with a significantly higher engraftment rate than CB (hazard ratio [HR], 7.77; P < .001 and HR, 2.81; P = .016, respectively). Although the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was significantly higher in the PBSC group than in the CB group (HR, 2.83; P = .011), the incidence of 1-year nonrelapse mortality was lower in the PBSC group than in the CB group (HR, 0.43; P = .019), and 1-year overall survival was superior in the PBSC group compared with the CB group (HR, 0.45; P = .036).

For less-fit patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies frequently affecting the central nervous system, we designed a radiation-free regimen with fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day on days -6 to -4), carmustine (400 mg/m2 on day -6), and thiotepa (5 mg/kg twice daily on days -5 and -4), all of which readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier and have potent antileukemic and lymphotoxic activity. Here we present a series of 30 consecutive patients with high-risk or relapsed disease who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with this protocol. The median patient age was 60 years (range, 42-70 years), and the median follow-up was 968 days (range, 58-1989 days). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and alemtuzumab (10-20 mg). At 2 years, overall survival was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34%-71%), event-free survival was 39% (95% CI, 22%-57%), cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 30% (95% CI, 17%-52%), and treatment-related mortality was 31% (95% CI, 18%-53%). Neurologic toxicity is a concern, especially in older and heavily pretreated patients. Our experience indicates the feasibility of this regimen as an alternative to total body irradiation and a potentially curative option for less-fit patients who need a highly central nervous system-active conditioning.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

CADM1 is also ectopically expressed in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), conferring an invasive phenotype characteristic to ATL. Therefore, CADM1 plays dual roles in human oncogenesis. Here, we investigate the roles of CADM1 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that 10 of 35 (29%) primary SCLC tumors express CADM1 protein. Western blotting and RT-PCR analyses reveal that CADM1 is significantly expressed in 11 of 14 SCLC cells growing in suspension cultures but in neither of 2 SCLC cells showing attached growth to plastic dishes, suggesting that CADM1 is involved in anchorage-independent growth in SCLC. In the present study, we demonstrate that SCLC expresses a unique splicing variant of CADM1 (variant 8/9) containing additional extracellular fragments corresponding to exon 9 in addition to variant 8, a common isoform in epithelia. Variant 8/9 of CADM1 is almost exclusively observed in SCLC and testis, although this variant protein localizes along the membrane and shows similar cell aggregation activity to variant 8. Interestingly, both variant 8/9 and variant 8 of CADM1 show enhanced tumorigenicity in nude mice when transfected into SBC5, a SCLC cell lacking CADM1. Inversely, suppression of CADM1 expression by shRNA reduced spheroid-like cell aggregation of NCI-H69, an SCLC cell expressing a high amount of CADM1. These findings suggest that CADM1 enhances the malignant features of SCLC, as is observed in ATL, and could provide a molecular marker specific to SCLC.",['(c) 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Kikuchi, Shinji', 'Iwai, Miwako', 'Sakurai-Yageta, Mika', 'Tsuboi, Yumi', 'Ito, Takeshi', 'Maruyama, Tomoko', 'Tsuda, Hitoshi', 'Kanai, Yae', 'Onizuka, Masataka', 'Sato, Yukio', 'Murakami, Yoshinori']","['Kikuchi S', 'Iwai M', 'Sakurai-Yageta M', 'Tsuboi Y', 'Ito T', 'Maruyama T', 'Tsuda H', 'Kanai Y', 'Onizuka M', 'Sato Y', 'Murakami Y']","['Division of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120515,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2012/03/21 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2011/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02277.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Jun;103(6):1051-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02277.x.

AID is found in many B lymphomas, in myeloid leukemia, and in pathogen-induced tumors such as adult T cell leukemia. Although there is no solid evidence that AID causes human tumors, AID-transgenic and AID-deficient mouse models indicate that AID is both sufficient and required for tumorigenesis. Recently, AID's ability to cleave DNA has been shown to depend on topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and a histone H3K4 epigenetic mark. When the level of Top1 protein is decreased by AID activation, it induces irreversible cleavage in highly transcribed targets. This finding and others led to the idea that there is an evolutionary link between meiotic recombination and class switch recombination, which share H3K4 trimethyl, topoisomerase, the MRN complex, mismatch repair family proteins, and exonuclease 3. As Top1 has recently been shown to be involved in many transcription-associated genome instabilities, it is likely that AID took advantage of basic genome instability or diversification to evolve its mechanism for immune diversity. AID targets are therefore not highly specific to immunoglobulin genes and are relatively abundant, although they have strict requirements for transcription-induced H3K4 trimethyl modification and repetitive sequences prone to forming non-B structures. Inevitably, AID-dependent cleavage takes place in nonimmunoglobulin targets and eventually causes tumors. However, battles against infection are waged in the context of acute emergencies, while tumorigenesis is rather a chronic, long-term process. In the interest of survival, vertebrates must have evolved AID to prevent infection despite its long-term risk of causing tumorigenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Antifungal therapy was used in 100 of 321 febrile episodes (31%), and classified as empiric in 73 episodes, diagnostic-driven in 25 episodes and targeted in 2 episodes. Switching to a second-line antifungal therapy was needed in 28 of 100 episodes (28%) and was classified as empiric in 10 episodes (36%), diagnostic-driven in 17 episodes (61%) and targeted in 1 episode (4%). In 9 of 28 episodes (32%), switching to a third-line antifungal therapy was performed and was classified as empiric in 2 episodes (22%), diagnostic-driven in 6 episodes (67%) and targeted in 1 episode (11%). Invasive fungal infections was reported in 23 of 100 episodes: confirmed in 4 episodes, probable in 8 episodes, and possible in 11 episodes. Attributable mortality was 2.8%. Antifungal therapy was still used mostly empirically, whereas as fever persisted, its modification was guided by a diagnostic-driven approach.",['(c) 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],"['Cesaro, Simone', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Caira, Morena', 'Carraro, Francesca', 'Luciani, Matteo', 'Russo, Delia', 'Colombini, Antonella', 'Morello, William', 'Viale, Pierluigi', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Pegoraro, Anna', 'Nosari, Annamaria', 'Aversa, Franco']","['Cesaro S', 'Pagano L', 'Caira M', 'Carraro F', 'Luciani M', 'Russo D', 'Colombini A', 'Morello W', 'Viale P', 'Rossi G', 'Tridello G', 'Pegoraro A', 'Nosari A', 'Aversa F']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy. simone.cesaro@ospedaleuniverona.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",2012/03/21 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1439-0507.2012.02187.x [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2013 Jan;56(1):21-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2012.02187.x.

While the parameters obtained by flow cytometry analysis form the basis of the diagnosis of the disease, the question whether these parameters offer additional prognostic information still remains open. In this work, we attempt to provide computer-assisted support to the clinical experts of the field, by deploying a classification system for B-CLL multiparametric prognosis that combines various heterogeneous (clinical, laboratory and flow cytometry) parameters associated with the disease. For this purpose, we employ the naive-Bayes classifier and propose an algorithm that improves its performance. The algorithm discretizes the continuous classification attributes (candidate prognostic parameters) and selects the most useful subset of them to optimize the classification accuracy. Thus, in addition to the high classification accuracy achieved, the proposed approach also suggests the most informative parameters for the prognosis.

AREAS COVERED: The aim of this paper is to give the reader a comprehensive review of how to treat CML at diagnosis, how to monitor the disease and a brief read of special populations and case scenarios. It describes the first-line (imatinib) and second-line (nilotinib and dasatinib) TKIs currently used for the treatment of CML, including landmark studies proving their efficacy, side effect profile, dosage and use in special populations. It also reviews the current guidelines regarding treatment and monitoring of the disease while on TKIs, along with an overview of treatment in advanced stages, the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and investigational drugs. EXPERT OPINION: Although imatinib represented a mayor therapeutic advancement over conventional chemotherapy, second-generation TKIs offer higher rates of optimal response and should be used as the frontline therapy. Patients with the T315I mutation carry a worse prognosis and should be offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

However, the initial enthusiasm generated by the high response rate to these drugs has been dampened by the development of resistance. The T315I mutation at the gatekeeper residue is very frequent in advanced phases of the disease and is one of the main causes of resistance, disrupting important contact points between the inhibitors and the enzyme. Different strategies have been implemented to overcome this resistance, such as the recent development of more selective non-ATP competitive inhibitors targeting sites outside the ATP-binding cleft. Some of these allosteric inhibitors alter the kinase conformation, while others directly compete with the protein substrates. Another interesting family of allosteric inhibitors is represented by those compounds targeting the myristate-pocket of Bcr-Abl (myristate-pocket binders). The binding of these inhibitors blocks the Bcr-Abl kinase in the inactive conformation and provides an advantage in overcoming drug resistance due to kinase mutations.

Although most PHEO/PGLs are benign, 10-35% present as (or develop into) malignant tumours with a poor prognosis. Overexpression of ERBB2 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2) has been reported to be associated with malignant PHEO. We used gene expression profiling of PHEO/PGLs to gain a better understanding of the tumourigenic pathways associated with ERBB2. METHODS: We used the Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 Plus 2.0 genome-wide gene expression cDNA microarray of 18 PHEO/PGLs (12 benign and six malignant, divided into two groups depending on ERBB2 expression levels) to analyse the gene expression patterns. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of transcription profiles of 18 samples identified two dominant expression clusters corresponding to samples belonging to the ERBB2+ and ERBB2- groups. According to the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) databases, the differentially expressed genes were classified into diverse functional categories and signalling pathways. In particular, the focal adhesion signalling pathway showed significant differences between the groups; specifically, the FAK-Src-MAPK pathway was prominently activated in the ERBB2+ group. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, ERBB2+ PHEO/PGLs have a distinct expression pattern compared with the ERBB2- group. The focal adhesion signalling pathway may participate in ERBB2-induced tumourigenesis in PHEO/PGLs.",['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Qi, Yan', 'Su, Tingwei', 'Zhang, Xia', 'Jiang, Yiran', 'Yuan, Wenqi', 'Wang, Weiqing', 'Cui, Bin', 'Ning, Guang']","['Qi Y', 'Su T', 'Zhang X', 'Jiang Y', 'Yuan W', 'Wang W', 'Cui B', 'Ning G']","['Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Paraganglioma/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Pheochromocytoma/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/21 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2265.2012.04388.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2012 Sep;77(3):399-406. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2012.04388.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the new candidates of influenza vaccines, influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) seem to be promising. Here, we generated 2 types of H5N1 influenza VLPs by co-expressing influenza virus Env (envelope protein) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Pol. VLPs generated by co-transfection of pHCMV-wtH5 or pHCMV-mtH5 with pSV-Mo-MLVgagpol and pHCMV-N1 were named as wtH5N1 VLPs or mtH5N1 VLPs. The plasmid of pHCMV-wtH5 encoded the wild-type hemagglutinin (HA) (wtH5) from A/swine/Anhui/ca/2004 (H5N1) with a multibasic cleavage site, while pHCMV-mtH5 encoded the modified mutant-type (mtH5) with a monobasic cleavage site. Influenza virus HA VLPs were characterized and equal amounts of them were used to immunize mice subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or intramuscularly. The levels of HA-specific IgG1, IFN-gamma, and neutralization antibodies were significantly induced in mice immunized with wtH5N1 VLPs or mtH5N1 VLPs via all 3 routes, while HA-specific IgG2a was barely detectable.

Biomarkers N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T (cTnT) have been hypothesized to reflect preclinical cardiotoxicity earlier than echocardiography. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the serial values of these cardiomarkers in leukemia patients treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients who were treated with allogeneic HSCT for acute leukemia at mean age of 32.8 years (range: 19-58) were studied. The conditioning regimen included high-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with total body irradiation (TBI) or busulphan. All patients were treated with anthracyclines earlier (median cumulative dose 250 mg/m, range: 150-580). METHODS: Cardiomarkers were measured before the preparative regimen (PR) and on days 1, 14 and 30 after HSCT. Their cardiac systolic function was assessed before PR, and 1-2 months after HSCT by echocardiography. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The differences in NT-proBNP before PR and after HSCT were statistically significant (p<0.001). The values of cTnT before and after HSCT were also significantly different (p=0.005). Persistent abnormalities (30 days after HSCT) of NT-proBNP levels were found in 19/21 patients (90.5 %) and of cTnT levels in 10/21 patients (47.6 %). The median cTnT concentrations were higher in patients treated with TBI than in patients without TBI (p=0.013). The median NT-proBNP values were higher in patients pretreated with higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines (>250 mg/m vs </=250 mg/m) Cardiac symptoms developed in 3/21 (14.3 %) patients (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 36).",,"['Roziakova, L', 'Bojtarova, E', 'Mistrik, M', 'Krajcovicova, I', 'Mladosievicova, B']","['Roziakova L', 'Bojtarova E', 'Mistrik M', 'Krajcovicova I', 'Mladosievicova B']","['School of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Bratisl Lek Listy,Bratislavske lekarske listy,0065324,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Troponin T/*blood', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/21 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/bll_2012_038 [doi]'],ppublish,Bratisl Lek Listy. 2012;113(3):159-62. doi: 10.4149/bll_2012_038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As discussed by FDA and ICH guidelines, all human pharmaceuticals in development should be evaluated for potential adverse effects on the immune system. Developmental immunotoxicology (DIT) focuses on the concern that early-life (during pre-/post-natal development) exposure to agents which target the immune system may result in enhanced susceptibility to immune-related disease (e.g., infection, autoimmunity, and cancer, particularly leukemia) compared to adults, unique effects not observed in adults, or more persistent effects in comparison to those following adult exposure. This article provides a substantive review of the literature and presents detailed considerations for DIT testing strategies with a specific focus on pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals. In this regard, differences between small molecule and large molecule therapeutics will be considered, along with recommendations for best practices in the assessment of DIT during drug development. In addition, gaps in the DIT knowledge base and current testing strategies are identified. Finally, a summary of an ILSI-HESI-ITC sponsored Workshop conducted in 2010, entitled 'Developmental Immunotoxicity Testing of Pharmaceuticals' will be presented.

Increases of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulation of endogenous sphingolipid levels are well-described events observed upon 4-HPR treatment, but there is still a lack of understanding of their relationship and their contribution to cell death. LC-MS analysis of sphingolipids revealed that in human leukemia CCRF-CEM and Jurkat cells, 4-HPR induced dihydroceramide but not ceramide accumulation even at sublethal concentrations. Myriocin prevented the 4-HPR-induced dihydroceramide accumulation, but it did not prevent the loss of viability and increase of intracellular ROS production. On the other hand, ascorbic acid, Trolox, and vitamin E reversed 4-HPR effects on cell death but not dihydroceramide accumulation. NDGA, described as a lipoxygenase inhibitor, exerted a significantly higher antioxidant activity than vitamin E and abrogated 4-HPR-mediated ROS. It did not however rescue cellular viability. Taken together, this study demonstrates that early changes observed upon 4-HPR treatment, i.e., sphingolipid modulation and ROS production, are mechanistically independent events. Furthermore, the results indicate that 4-HPR-driven cell death may occur even in the absence of dihydroceramide or ROS accumulation.

Their clinical course varies from one patient to another. Bendamustine (Levact, MA holder Astellas, French representative: Mundipharma), an alkylating agent, was authorised for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and multiple myeloma, and for second-line single-agent treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Most data on the efficacy of bendamustine as first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia come from a randomised unblinded trial comparing bendamustine versus chlorambucil in 312 patients. The trial was stopped prematurely (which tends to overestimate the benefits) after a median follow-up of 35 months. Median overall survival did not differ between the groups but the length of follow-up was inadequate, given the slow course of the disease. Median progression-free survival was statistically significantly longer with bendamustine (21.5 months versus 8.3 months). The overall response rate was also statistically significantly higher with bendamustine (68% versus 31%). An indirect comparison (there are no head-to-head comparisons) suggests that these results are similar to those obtained with fludarabine. In indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, assessment of bendamustine is mainly based on a single uncontrolled trial. No data on overall survival were reported, ruling out conclusions as to the possible benefits of bendamustine. In multiple myeloma, assessment of bendamustine is based on an unblinded trial of bendamustine + prednisone versus melphalan + prednisone in 131 patients. This trial took place before the value of thalidomide in this setting had been shown. In addition, it suffered from many methodological flaws (study population, endpoints, etc.). Bendamustine had no advantages over melphalan. Bendamustine has many serious and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, including frequent myelosuppression, infections, and secondary cancers. In practice, the efficacy of bendamustine in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma is uncertain, while its adverse effects are numerous, varied and often severe.

As shown previously, depletion of FLASH halts growth by down-regulating histone biosynthesis and arrests the cell cycle in S-phase. FLASH knockdown followed by stimulating the cells with Fas ligand or anti-Fas antibodies was found to be associated with a more rapid cleavage of PARP, accelerated activation of caspase-8 and the executioner caspase-3 and rapid progression to cellular disintegration. As is the case for most anti-apoptotic proteins, FLASH was degraded soon after the onset of apoptosis. Depletion of FLASH also resulted in the reduced intracellular levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, MCL-1 and the short isoform of cFLIP.

METHODS: In 2008, we conducted a nationwide survey in Germany in which we asked 4689 female and male patients who had been treated for cancer in childhood or adolescence for information on menstruation, previous fertility testing (if any), attempts to conceive, and pregnancies. In a complementary study carried out in 2009, 748 former cancer patients in Berlin were offered hormone testing and sperm analysis. The defined criteria for suspected infertility were, in women, anti-muellerian hormone levels below 0.1 ng/mL; in men, FSH levels above 10 IU/L and inhibin B levels below 80 pg/mL, or azoospermia. RESULTS: The respondents to the nationwide survey included 1476 leukemia survivors and 1278 persons who had had a solid tumor. 104 former leukemia patients and 96 former solid tumor patients had already undergone fertility testing, leading to the suspicion of infertility in 26% and 34% of the persons in these respective groups (95% confidence intervals [CI], 18%-34% and 25%-43%). The patients who were tested in the Berlin study included 59 leukemia survivors and 104 persons who had had a solid tumor.

Patients with severe congenital neutropenia referred to Immunology, Asthma and Allergy Research Institute between Jan 2007 and Dec 2010 enrolled the study. Other causes of neutropenia were excluded by serial CBC and bone marrow studies, medical and drug histories and immunological tests. Patients were visited and examined monthly to evaluate their CBC and ANC (absolute neutrophil count), GCSF side effects and dosage adjustment. Cytogenetic studies were being done for all the patients for early detection of progression to AML/MDS. From twenty two patients who enrolled this study, 16 patients regularly evaluated. They were ten males and six females, range in age from 2 to 18 years old. Two patients failed to continue our follow up unfortunately and four patients died due to disease complications. Patients were followed for 24 to 48 months.

Analysis of transcript levels revealed significantly elevated expression of Mn1, and a trend toward increased expression of Bcl11a and Fosb in Mll-AF9 murine leukemia samples with proviral insertions proximal to these genes. Accordingly, FOSB and BCL11A were also overexpressed in human AML harboring MLL gene translocations. FOSB was revealed to be essential for growth in mouse and human myeloid leukemia cells using shRNA lentiviral vectors in vitro.

Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV RT) is a 75 kDa monomer. These two RTs are the most extensively used for conversion of RNA to DNA. We previously developed several mutations that increase the thermostability of MMLV RT and generated a highly stable MMLV RT variant E286R/E302K/L435R/D524A by combining three of them (Glu286-->Arg, Glu302-->Lys, and Leu435-->Arg) and the mutation to abolish RNase H activity (Asp524-->Ala) [Yasukawa et al.

To generate a highly stable AMV RT variant, we have introduced the triple mutation of Val238-->Arg, Leu388-->Arg, and Asp450-->Ala into AMV RT alpha-subunit and the resulted variant V238R/L388R/D450A, was expressed in insect cells and purified. The temperature decreasing the initial activity by 50 %, measured over 10 min, of the variant with or without template primer (T/P), poly(rA)-p(dT)(15), was 50 degrees C; for the wild-type AMV RT alpha-subunit (WT) this was 44 degrees C. The highest temperature at which the variant exhibited cDNA synthesis activity was 64 degrees C; the WT was 60 degrees C. A highly stable AMV RT alpha-subunit is therefore generated by the same mutation strategy as applied to MMLV RT and that positive charges are introduced into RT at positions that have been implicated to interact with T/P by site-directed mutagenesis.",,"['Konishi, Atsushi', 'Yasukawa, Kiyoshi', 'Inouye, Kuniyo']","['Konishi A', 'Yasukawa K', 'Inouye K']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120317,Netherlands,Biotechnol Lett,Biotechnology letters,8008051,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Stability/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Hot Temperature', 'Insecta', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Stability/radiation effects', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/03/20 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10529-012-0904-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Lett. 2012 Jul;34(7):1209-15. doi: 10.1007/s10529-012-0904-9.

However, the extent and duration of these responses are heterogeneous, suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers affecting an individual's response to TKIs. Using paired-end DNA sequencing, we discovered a common intronic deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM). BIM is a pro-apoptotic member of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins, and its upregulation is required for TKIs to induce apoptosis in kinase-driven cancers. The polymorphism switched BIM splicing from exon 4 to exon 3, which resulted in expression of BIM isoforms lacking the pro-apoptotic BCL2-homology domain 3 (BH3). The polymorphism was sufficient to confer intrinsic TKI resistance in CML and EGFR NSCLC cell lines, but this resistance could be overcome with BH3-mimetic drugs. Notably, individuals with CML and EGFR NSCLC harboring the polymorphism experienced significantly inferior responses to TKIs than did individuals without the polymorphism (P = 0.02 for CML and P = 0.027 for EGFR NSCLC). Our results offer an explanation for the heterogeneity of TKI responses across individuals and suggest the possibility of personalizing therapy with BH3 mimetics to overcome BIM-polymorphism-associated TKI resistance.",,"['Ng, King Pan', 'Hillmer, Axel M', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Juan, Wen Chun', 'Ko, Tun Kiat', 'Teo, Audrey S M', 'Ariyaratne, Pramila N', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Sawada, Kenichi', 'Fei, Yao', 'Soh, Sheila', 'Lee, Wah Heng', 'Huang, John W J', 'Allen, John C Jr', 'Woo, Xing Yi', 'Nagarajan, Niranjan', 'Kumar, Vikrant', 'Thalamuthu, Anbupalam', 'Poh, Wan Ting', 'Ang, Ai Leen', 'Mya, Hae Tha', 'How, Gee Fung', 'Yang, Li Yi', 'Koh, Liang Piu', 'Chowbay, Balram', 'Chang, Chia-Tien', 'Nadarajan, Veera S', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Than, Hein', 'Lim, Lay Cheng', 'Goh, Yeow Tee', 'Zhang, Shenli', 'Poh, Dianne', 'Tan, Patrick', 'Seet, Ju-Ee', 'Ang, Mei-Kim', 'Chau, Noan-Minh', 'Ng, Quan-Sing', 'Tan, Daniel S W', 'Soda, Manabu', 'Isobe, Kazutoshi', 'Nothen, Markus M', 'Wong, Tien Y', 'Shahab, Atif', 'Ruan, Xiaoan', 'Cacheux-Rataboul, Valere', 'Sung, Wing-Kin', 'Tan, Eng Huat', 'Yatabe, Yasushi', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Soo, Ross A', 'Chin, Tan Min', 'Lim, Wan-Teck', 'Ruan, Yijun', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Ng KP', 'Hillmer AM', 'Chuah CT', 'Juan WC', 'Ko TK', 'Teo AS', 'Ariyaratne PN', 'Takahashi N', 'Sawada K', 'Fei Y', 'Soh S', 'Lee WH', 'Huang JW', 'Allen JC Jr', 'Woo XY', 'Nagarajan N', 'Kumar V', 'Thalamuthu A', 'Poh WT', 'Ang AL', 'Mya HT', 'How GF', 'Yang LY', 'Koh LP', 'Chowbay B', 'Chang CT', 'Nadarajan VS', 'Chng WJ', 'Than H', 'Lim LC', 'Goh YT', 'Zhang S', 'Poh D', 'Tan P', 'Seet JE', 'Ang MK', 'Chau NM', 'Ng QS', 'Tan DS', 'Soda M', 'Isobe K', 'Nothen MM', 'Wong TY', 'Shahab A', 'Ruan X', 'Cacheux-Rataboul V', 'Sung WK', 'Tan EH', 'Yatabe Y', 'Mano H', 'Soo RA', 'Chin TM', 'Lim WT', 'Ruan Y', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer & Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120318,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Annexins/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transfection']",2012/03/20 06:00,2012/06/08 06:00,['2012/03/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2713 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2713 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Med. 2012 Mar 18;18(4):521-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.2713.,,,,,,,"['GEO/GSE26954', 'GEO/GSE28303']",,,,,"['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2012 May;9(5):247.

Tumor miRNA expression by RT-qPCR correlated with tumor grade, size, and presence of carcinoma in situ for miR-222, recurrence (miR-222 and miR-143), progression (miR-222 and miR-143), disease-specific survival (miR-222), and overall survival (miR-222). Protein expression patterns of potential miRNA targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor, BCL2, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene (ERBB) homolog 3, and ERBB4, were evaluated by IHC in tissue arrays containing tumors for which miRNAs were assessed by RT-qPCR. Target expression correlated with expression of their predicted regulatory miRNAs, recurrence (ERBB3), progression (ERBB4), disease-specific survival (ERBB3 and ERBB4), and overall survival (ERBB3 and ERBB4). Furthermore, RT-qPCR of miR-452 (area under the curve, 0.848) and miR-222 (area under the curve, 0.718) in urine provided high accuracies for bladder cancer diagnosis.

Therefore, we screened 95 patients with congenital heart defects, including OFT malformations, for variants in genes encoding PBX proteins, as well as interacting proteins. The coding exons of PBX1-4, PKNOX1, PKNOX2, MEIS1-3, and PBXIP1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the products analyzed on a lightscanner. Samples with abnormal melting profiles were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Seven non-synonymous variants (6 novel and 1 SNP) were identified in 5 proteins (Pbx3, Pbx4, Meis1, Meis3 and Pknox1). One Pbx3 variant, p.A136V, is located in a highly conserved polyalanine tract and predicted to be deleterious. This variant was present in 5.2% of heart defect patients compared with 1.3% of 380 race- and ethnicity-matched controls (P<0.05). None of the other variants were predicted to be damaging.

To characterize the functions of BCL11B, recombinant BCL11B and BCL11B siRNA were transfected into human naive T cells to overexpress or knock down BCL11B expression, respectively. After BCL11B overexpression, the proliferation ability and the T-helper (Th) subset were increased, whereas no significant alteration in the expression pattern and clonality of the T-cell receptor Vbeta subfamilies was observed. After BCL11B knockdown, a similar distribution of Vbeta subfamilies was detected in the naive T cells; however, the proliferation capacity substantially decreased. Global gene expression profiling revealed that the dysregulated genes were mainly involved in T-cell activation and proliferation. BCL11B could selectively promote Th-cell differentiation because of increased CXCL10 and CXCL11 expression. BCL11B suppression may inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis, which may relate to changes in the expression of CFLAR-CASP8-CASP10 in the mitochondrial pathways.

RESULTS: Among the WNT genes, WNT-7B (p=0.026), WNT-9A (p=0.020) and WNT-16B (p=0.023) were significantly over-expressed, whereas WNT-2B (p=0.033), WNT-5A (p=0.016), WNT-7A (p<0.0001) and WNT-10A (p<0.0001) were down-regulated in B-ALL. Among the T-ALL subtype, however, significant down-regulation of WNT-2B, WNT-5B, WNT-7A, WNT-10A and WNT-11 was evident. Comparison between B-ALL subtypes showed significant over-expression of WNT-7B, WNT-9A and WNT-5B in certain subtypes.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to generate a 2-D map and profile of proteins secreted from a high secretory variant of the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3.1, which in view of the difficulty associated with gaining adequate numbers of pure primary mast cell and basophiles, represents an accepted model system for the study and standardization of the methodology to characterize the secretome of these cell types. METHODS: A 2-D map of secretory proteins was generated by 2-D PAGE and a shotgun mass spectrometric approach carried out for protein identification. RESULTS: Study resulted into identification of 299 proteins released from resting and IgE receptor activated RBL-2H3.1 cells after 90 s, 30 min and 3 h antigen challenge. Further sequence analysis identified ~53% of total proteins as secretory proteins which could be attributed to classical and non-classical secretory pathways. Additionally, functional classification of classic secretory proteins verified the presence of proteins belonged to cytokines, receptors, membrane proteins, lysosomal proteins and proteins associated with specific sub-cellular localizations such as endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, nucleus, cytoplasm and ribosome. According to this data the presence of some secretory proteins such as cytokines (e.g. MCP-2, PF-4, CSF-1 and TGF-beta1) are all subject to Ag challenge which may point to their importance toward pathogenesis in allergic diseases.

METHODS: Patients with unresectable MM and no symptomatic effusions were given dasatinib 70 mg twice daily as part of a 28-day cycle. We also measured plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor b and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and mesothelin-related protein at baseline and during therapy. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Fifty percent of the first 12 patients enrolled experienced >/=grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, and therefore, the starting dose was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included fatigue (11%) and pleural effusion (9%). The overall disease control rate was 32.6%, and progression-free survival at 24 weeks was 23% (95% confidence interval: 13.5-40.0%).

As a prospective correlative study of Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30203, a randomized phase II trial of carboplatin/gemcitabine with eicosanoid modulators (celecoxib, zileuton, or both) in advanced NSCLC, serum CYFRA levels were obtained before and during treatment. METHODS: Serum CYFRA levels were measured at baseline and after the first cycle of treatment using an electrochemoluminescent assay. Paired specimens were available from 88 patients. The logarithms of the initial concentration and of the difference in concentrations were analyzed for association with overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS). RESULTS: Lower baseline CYFRA levels were associated with both longer OS and FFS (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003). In addition, larger reductions in CYFRA levels correlated with longer OS and FFS (p = 0.0255 and p = 0.0068).

These molecular findings are the basis for risk-adapted therapy; however, such data are generally obtained by disparate methods in the clinical laboratory, and often rely on low-resolution techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization. Using targeted next generation sequencing, we demonstrate that the full spectrum of prognostically significant gene mutations including translocations, single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and insertions/deletions (indels) can be identified simultaneously in multiplexed sequence data. As proof of concept, we performed hybrid capture using a panel of 20 genes implicated in leukemia prognosis (covering a total of 1 Mbp) from five leukemia cell lines including K562, NB4, OCI-AML3, kasumi-1, and MV4-11. Captured DNA was then sequenced in multiplex on an Illumina HiSeq. Using an analysis pipeline based on freely available software we correctly identified DNA-level translocations in three of the three cell lines where translocations were covered by our capture probes. Furthermore, we found all published gene mutations in commonly tested genes including NPM1, FLT3, and KIT. The same methodology was applied to DNA extracted from the bone marrow of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia, and identified a t(9;11) translocation with single base accuracy as well other gene mutations. These results indicate that targeted next generation sequencing can be successfully applied in the clinical laboratory to identify a full spectrum of DNA mutations ranging from SNVs and indels to translocations.

Antimyeloma drugs are combined in induction, consolidation and/or maintenance protocols to destroy bulky disease, then suppress or eradicate residual disease. Oncolytic viruses have the potential to mediate both tumor debulking and residual disease elimination, but this curative paradigm remains unproven. Here, we engineered an oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus to minimize its neurotoxicity, enhance induction of antimyeloma immunity and facilitate noninvasive monitoring of its intratumoral spread. Using high-resolution imaging, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the intravenously administered virus extravasates from tumor blood vessels in immunocompetent myeloma-bearing mice, nucleating multiple intratumoral infectious centers that expand rapidly and necrose at their centers, ultimately coalescing to cause extensive tumor destruction. This oncolytic tumor debulking phase lasts only for 72 h after virus administration, and is completed before antiviral antibodies become detectable in the bloodstream. Antimyeloma T cells, cross-primed as the virus-infected cells provoke an antiviral immune response, then eliminate residual uninfected myeloma cells.

However, current therapy is unable to completely cure and/or prevent bone lesions. Although it is accepted that myeloma cells mediate bone destruction by inhibition of osteoblasts and activation of osteoclasts, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. This study demonstrates that constitutive activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in myeloma cells is responsible for myeloma-induced osteolysis. Our results show that p38 is constitutively activated in most myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells from patients. Myeloma cells with high/detectable p38 activity, but not those with low/undetectable p38 activity, injected into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) or SCID-hu mice caused bone destruction. Inhibition or knockdown of p38 in human myeloma reduced or prevented myeloma-induced osteolytic bone lesions without affecting tumor growth, survival, or homing to bone. Mechanistic studies showed that myeloma cell p38 activity inhibited osteoblastogenesis and bone formation and activated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in myeloma-bearing SCID mice. This study elucidates a novel molecular mechanism-activation of p38 signaling in myeloma cells-by which myeloma cells induce osteolytic bone lesions, and indicates that targeting myeloma cell p38 may be a viable approach to treating or preventing myeloma bone disease.",,"['Yang, J', 'He, J', 'Wang, J', 'Cao, Y', 'Ling, J', 'Qian, J', 'Lu, Y', 'Li, H', 'Zheng, Y', 'Lan, Y', 'Hong, S', 'Matthews, J', 'Starbuck, M W', 'Navone, N M', 'Orlowski, R Z', 'Lin, P', 'Kwak, L W', 'Yi, Q']","['Yang J', 'He J', 'Wang J', 'Cao Y', 'Ling J', 'Qian J', 'Lu Y', 'Li H', 'Zheng Y', 'Lan Y', 'Hong S', 'Matthews J', 'Starbuck MW', 'Navone NM', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Lin P', 'Kwak LW', 'Yi Q']","['Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. jiyang@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120319,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Diseases/enzymology/*etiology/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/*enzymology/pathology', 'Osteolysis/enzymology/*etiology/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/03/20 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201271 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.71 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2114-23. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.71.

This systematic review evaluates the real impact of DD chemotherapy. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing conventional adjuvant chemotherapy versus a DD regimen for EBC patients were searched in electronic databases. Dose-dense regimens included the same drugs and total amount as conventional chemotherapy, but applied in shorter intervals. Meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) were expressed with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicities. Analyses were conducted according to tumor hormone receptor expression, plus tests for interaction. RESULTS: Four studies (3418 patients) were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated that DD therapy can improve DFS (3356 patients; HR=0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.95; p=0.005), independent of hormone receptor expression status. There was no OS benefit with DD therapy (3356 patients; HR=0.86; 95% CI 0.73-1.01; p=0.06) irrespective of tumor hormone receptor status (OS in hormone-positive stratum HR=0.94; 95% CI 0.74-1.21; OS in hormone-negative stratum HR=0.78; 95% CI 0.62-0.99; interaction test p=0.28). DD regimens caused a small increase in anemia and mucositis, but had no impact on cardiac events, leukemia or myelodysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: DD adjuvant chemotherapy can improve DFS of EBC patients with little impact on safety. However there is no clear benefit in OS. Further research may indicate if there is any impact on OS not presently seen due to small sample size, and which patients may derive greater benefit.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic activity of Antp-TPR peptide toward acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. It was demonstrated that Antp-TPR peptide induced AML cell death in cell lines such as U937, K562, THP-1, and HL-60 via activation of caspases 3 and 7, and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, Antp-TPR peptide did not reduce the viability of normal cells including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), although both geldanamycin and 17-AAG, small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90, mediated cytotoxicity to these normal cells at low concentrations. In addition, mutation analysis of TPR peptide demonstrated that the highly conserved amino acids Lys and Arg were critical to the cytotoxic activity.

The aspergilloma is defined as a rounded mass, developing in a cavity by the proliferation of spores of Aspergillus. The most common complication was haemoptysis reported in 50-95% of cases. The pleuropulmonary lesions predisposing are: tuberculosis, residual pleural space, emphysema and lung destroyed by fibrosis or radiotherapy or bronchiectasis. The indications for surgery depend on symptoms, respiratory function, the parenchyma and the type of aspergilloma (simple or complex). In a patient with an intrapulmonary aspergilloma, lung resection preceded by embolization is recommended based on respiratory function. For intrapleural aspergilloma, thoracoplasty is recommended according to the patient's general condition. The invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is characterized by an invasion of lung tissue and blood vessels by hyphae in immunocompromised patients. The death rate of patients who have an API after treatment for leukemia or lymphoma was 30 to 40%, after bone marrow transplantation 60%, after solid organ transplantation from 50 to 60% and after any other cause of immunocompromising from 70 to 85%. The main cause of these deaths is massive hemoptysis. Surgery (lobectomy) is indicated for the prevention of hemoptysis when the mass is in contact with the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, and if it increases in size with the disappearance of border security between the mass and the vessel wall. The patient will be operated in an emergency before the white blood cells do not exceed the threshold of 1000 cells/mul. A persistent residual mass after antifungal treatment may justify a lung resection (lobectomy or wedge) before a new aggressive therapy.

In PEI the main potato farming areas are in close proximity and drain directly to estuaries. Runoff from high agricultural activity watersheds could impact benthic organism health in the depositional zone of downstream estuaries. The estuarine filter feeder Mya arenaria (soft-shell clam) could be particularly vulnerable to both particle-adsorbed and water soluble contaminants. M. arenaria is susceptible to haemocytic leukemia. In May 2009, we established that heavily proliferated leukemia (HPL) prevalence was generally higher in PEI estuaries located downstream of high intensity potato farming (Dunk and Wilmot estuaries) watersheds than in estuaries downstream of lower intensity areas. Using Mab-1E10 based immunocytochemistry we observed that leukemic haemocytes from the Dunk and Wilmot estuaries were 1E10 negative whereas those from the Ox/Sheep estuary (low potato farming intensity) were 1E10 positive. The expression of genes in the p53 tumour suppressor pathway enabled us to differentiate groups of leukemic and normal M. arenaria, validating our diagnoses. In October 2009, we confirmed that HPL prevalence was elevated in the Dunk and Wilmot estuaries compared to reference (Souris River). Moreover, leukemia prevalence declined with distance from the river mouths along transects through the Dunk and Wilmot estuaries. The pesticides ss-endosulfan and alpha-endosulfan were detected in surface sediments from the Dunk and Wilmot estuaries, but not in sediments from either the Souris River or several other lower intensity potato farming watersheds.

Our cross-sectional observational study of 33 patients with myeloproliferative disorders found that 9 patients, 27.27% had occult deficiency despite having normal to elevated serum vitamin B(12) levels. Early detection of vitamin B(12) deficiency by using the methylmalonic acid measurement may prevent significant neurologic and hematologic complications in patients with myeloproliferative disorders. In patients with myeloproliferative disorders, normal to high serum vitamin B(12) concentrations have often been reported. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether normal or elevated serum vitamin B(12) levels in myeloproliferative disorders might actually mask the true underlying vitamin B(12) deficiency in some patients. Thirty-three patients (12 men, 21 women; mean age, 70.55 years [range, 37-90 years]) with polycythemia vera (n = 13), essential thrombocythemia (n = 12), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 5), and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) (n = 3) were accrued over a period of 1 year, from March 2009 to February 2010. From all of the subjects, serum vitamin B(12) level, methylmalonic acid level, a basic complete blood cell count panel, and liver and renal function tests were obtained. Normal to elevated serum vitamin B(12) levels were recorded in all the patients. However, elevated serum methylmalonic acid levels were found in 9 (27.27%) patients, with a prevalence of 2 patients with polycythemia vera, 23% in polycythemia vera, 4 patients with essential thrombocythemia, 33.3% in essential thrombocythemia, 1 patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 20% in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 2 patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, 66.7% in IMF.

AREAS COVERED: The present review describes i) experimental evidence for a role for PLKs and Aurora kinases in human leukemogenesis and ii) the results from clinical studies of PLK and Aurora kinase inhibitors in the treatment of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The review was based on searches in the PubMed and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases. These inhibitors have antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in AML cells. Hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities are frequently dose limiting, and this may limit the use of these agents in combination with conventional AML therapy. Aurora kinase inhibitors seem to be most effective for patients with high expression of the target kinases, and the same may be true for PLK inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION: PLK inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of AML. Future clinical studies have to clarify i) whether this strategy is most effective for certain subsets of patients; ii) whether multikinase inhibitors targeting several cell cycle regulators should be preferred; and iii) how this therapeutic strategy eventually should be combined with conventional antileukemic chemotherapy.",,"['Tsykunova, Galina', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Ahmed, Aymen Bushra', 'Nepstad, Ina', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Tsykunova G', 'Reikvam H', 'Ahmed AB', 'Nepstad I', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Haukeland University Hospital, Division for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120317,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2012/03/20 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/03/20 06:00'],"['2012/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.668525 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 May;21(5):587-603. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.668525.

METHODS: The chemotherapy regimen consisted of induction, post-remission and maintenance for 2 years. The primary endpoint was 5-year progression-free survival, and secondary endpoints included complete remission rate, overall survival and adverse events. Among 115 patients enrolled, 108 eligible patients [median age, 33.5 years (range, 15-69)] including 96 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 12 lymphoblastic lymphoma were assessed. Other major characteristics were male 50%, T-cell phenotype 21%, Philadelphia chromosome 22%, B-symptom+ 35% and performance status 2/3 22%. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients achieved complete remission (81%; 95% confidence interval 72-88%), while five (5%) died during the chemotherapy protocol. The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 1.8 years (95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.6) and 1.2 years (95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.6), respectively. Their 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 29 and 28%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival of 31 patients who underwent allogeneic (n = 19) or autologous (n = 12) stem cell transplantation during first complete response was 51%. Major non-hematologic toxicities of Grade 3 or greater were infections (21%) and pulmonary complications (6%). When compared with the investigators' previous Phase II trials, JCOG9402 improved progression-free survival and overall survival when compared with JCOG8702; however, it did not show improvement when compared with JCOG9004.

Cytarabine is a key constituent of remission induction chemotherapy. The effect of G-CSF priming has not been investigated in relationship with variable dose levels of cytarabine. We randomized 917 AML patients to receive G-CSF (456 patients) or no G-CSF (461 patients) at the days of chemotherapy. In the initial part of the study, 406 patients were also randomized between 2 cytarabine regimens comparing conventional-dose (199 patients) versus escalated-dose (207 patients) cytarabine in cycles 1 and 2. We found that patients after induction chemotherapy plus G-CSF had similar overall survival (43% vs 40%, P = .88), event-free survival (37% vs 31%, P = .29), and relapse rates (34% vs 36%, P = .77) at 5 years as those not receiving G-CSF. However, patients treated with the escalated-dose cytarabine regimen benefited from G-CSF priming, with improved event-free survival (P = .01) and overall survival (P = .003), compared with patients without G-CSF undergoing escalated-dose cytarabine treatment. A significant survival advantage of sensitizing AML for chemotherapy with G-CSF was not apparent in the entire study group, but it was seen in patients treated with escalated-dose cytarabine during remission induction.

Understanding the molecular/biologic features underlying the risk of progression may significantly modify our strategies for correctly managing B-cell premalignant states. MBL cells bear the same chromosomal abnormalities of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Genome-wide sequencing and animal models indicate that genetic abnormalities disrupting the control of cell growth and survival cooperate with microenvironment-triggered events, mainly represented by antigen-mediated B-cell receptor and coreceptor stimulation, to trigger and fuel clonal expansion.

Genetic determinants of susceptibility to IL are unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have identified susceptibility loci at IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE. PROCEDURE: We genotyped these loci in 171 infants with leukemia and 384 controls and evaluated associations overall, by subtype [ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)], and by presence (+) or absence (-) of MLL rearrangements. RESULTS: Homozygosity for a variant IKZF1 allele (rs11978267) increased risk of infant AML [Odds ratio (OR) = 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-8.4]; the increased risk was similar for AML/MLL+ and MLL- cases. In contrast, risk of ALL/MLL- was increased in infants homozygous for the IKZF1 variant (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.8-14.5) but the variant did not modify risk of ALL/MLL+. For ARID5B (rs10821936), homozygosity for the variant allele increased risk for the ALL/MLL- subgroup only (OR = 7.2, 95% CI = 2.5-20.6). There was little evidence of an association with the CEBP variant (rs2239633). CONCLUSION: IKZF1 is expressed in early hematopoiesis, including precursor myeloid cells. Our data provide the first evidence that IKZF1 modifies susceptibility to infant AML, irrespective of MLL rearrangements, and could provide important new etiologic insights into this rare and heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ross, Julie A', 'Linabery, Amy M', 'Blommer, Crystal N', 'Langer, Erica K', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Radloff, Gretchen A', 'Tower, Richard L', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Ross JA', 'Linabery AM', 'Blommer CN', 'Langer EK', 'Spector LG', 'Hilden JM', 'Heerema NA', 'Radloff GA', 'Tower RL', 'Davies SM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. rossx014@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120315,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2012/03/17 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/03/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24131 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Jan;60(1):31-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24131.

Therefore, ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy has been widely accepted and used as a classic treatment. It has been demonstrated that high doses of cytarabine have a good effect on the prevention of relapse for high-risk patients. However, as the indications of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for APL are being extended from the original relapse treatment to the first-line treatment of de novo APL, we find that the regimen of ATRA, combined with ATO, seems to be a new treatment option because of their targeting mechanisms, milder toxicities and improvements of long-term outcomes; this combination may become a potentially curable treatment modality for APL.

Such high-level Flt3 expression has to date not been reported in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, despite the fact that oncogenic Flt3 aberrancies are frequent in AML patients. We show here that ectopic Flt3 expression in different human cancer cell lines might reduce proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death, involving Bax/Bcl2 modulation. Selective depletion of Flt3-expressing cells occurred in human AML cell lines transduced with retroviral Flt3 constructs, shown here using the HL-60 leukemic cell line. Flt3 expression was investigated in two cellular model systems, the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line and the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line, and proliferation was reduced in both systems.

Intracellular metabolism of this prodrug is a key component of the therapeutic response. Many metabolizing enzymes are involved in 6-MP disposition and active 6-MP metabolites are represented by 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and methylated metabolites primarily methylated by the thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme (TPMT). The genetic polymorphism affecting TPMT activity displays an important inter-subject variability in metabolites pharmacokinetics and influences the balance between 6-MP efficacy and toxicity: patients with high 6-TGN levels are at risk of myelosuppression while patients with high levels of methylated derivates are at hepatotoxic risk. However, the genetic TPMT polymorphism does not explain all 6-MP adverse events and some severe toxicities leading to life-threatening conditions remain unexplained. Additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding enzymes involved in 6-MP metabolism and 6-MP transporters may also be responsible for this inter-individual 6-MP response variability. AIM: This review presents the pharmacogenetic aspects of 6-MP metabolism in great detail. We have focused on published data on ALL treatment supporting the great potential of 6-MP pharmacogenetics to improve efficacy, tolerance, and event-free survival rates in children with ALL.",,"['Adam de Beaumais, Tiphaine', 'Jacqz-Aigrain, Evelyne']","['Adam de Beaumais T', 'Jacqz-Aigrain E']","['Department of Pediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Robert Debre Hospital, 48 Boulevard Serurier, 75019 Paris, France. tiphaine.debeaumais@rdb.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120316,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biotransformation/genetics', 'Child', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism']",2012/03/17 06:00,2012/12/27 06:00,['2012/03/17 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-012-1251-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Sep;68(9):1233-42. doi: 10.1007/s00228-012-1251-4.

It is the BCR/ABL protein that drives the neoplasm and the ABL/BCR is not necessary for the disease. In the majority of CML cases, the BCR/ABL fusion gene is cytogenetically recognizable as a small derivative chromosome 22(der 22), which is known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. However, approximately 2-10% of patients with CML involve cryptic or complex variant translocations with deletions on the der(9) and/or der(22) occuring in roughly 10-15% of CML cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis can help identify deletions and complex or cryptic rearrangements. Various BCR/ABL FISH probes are available, which include dual color single fusion, dual color extra signal (ES), dual color dual fusion and tri color dual fusion probes. To test the utility of these probes, six patients diagnosed with CML carrying different complex variant Ph translocations were studied by G-banding and FISH analysis using the BCR/ABL ES, BCR/ABL dual color dual fusion, and BCR/ABL tricolor probes.

Molecular, biological, and clinical data indicate that TAM is initiated before birth when fetal liver haematopoietic cells trisomic for chromosome 21 acquire mutations in GATA1.

Since mechanisms of vitamin D resistance are not clear, we studied 40AF cells, a subline of HL60 cells that can proliferate in the presence of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D). We found that mRNA and protein levels of HPK1, an upstream MAP4 kinase, are dramatically increased in 40AF cells, and HPK1 protein is further increased when the 1,25D resistance of 40AF cells is partially reversed by the addition of carnosic acid and p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (DCS cocktail). Knockdown of HPK1 reduces 1,25D/DCS-induced differentiation of both 1,25D-sensitive HL60 and U937 cells and 1,25D-resistant 40AF cells, but the effect of HPK1 knockdown on differentiation-associated G 1 arrest is more apparent in the resistant than the sensitive cells. To explain why 40AF and the intrinsically vitamin D-resistant KG-1a cells can proliferate in the presence of vitamin D, we found that the cleaved HPK1 fragment (HPK1-C) level is high in 40AF and KG-1a cells, but when differentiation is induced by DCS, HPK1-C decreases while full-length (FL)-HPK1 increases. Accordingly, inhibition of proteolysis with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh reduced HPK1 cleavage and enhanced DCS-induced differentiation of 40AF cells. The results indicate that FL-HPK1 is a positive regulator of vitamin D-induced differentiation in AML cells, but the cleaved HPK1 fragment inhibits differentiation.

By IHP, the 2-year PFS was 88% and 54% for PET-2 negative and positive groups, respectively (p = 0.0009). Similar results were obtained for Deauville criteria. In a univariate analysis, PET-2 predicted PFS better than %SPPD, and in a combinatorial analysis, in the PET-2 positive group, a negative dCT-2 increased PFS by 27-35%. However, some confidence intervals were large due to small sample sizes. In conclusion, IHP and Deauville criteria-based interpretation of PET-2 was strongly associated with 2-year PFS.

Two patients had a complete hematologic response (25%),1 major cytogenetic response, 1 complete cytogenetic response (25% any cytogenetic response), and 3 (37.5%)stable disease. No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed. These results show the ability of epigenetic therapy to revert imatinib resistance. BACKGROUND: Epigenetic alterations participate in the development of acquired resistance to imatinib, hence, the DNA methylation, and histone deacetylase inhibitors hydralazine and valproate, respectively, has the potential to overcome it. PATIENT AND METHODS: A series of 8 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) refractory to imatinib mesylate with no access to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were treated with hydralazine and valproate in a compassionate manner. Clinical efficacy and safety of these drugs added to imatinib mesylate were evaluated. RESULTS: Two patients were in the blast phase, 5 were in the accelerated phase, and 1 was in the chronic phase. All the patients continued with the same dose of imatinib that they had been receiving at the time of development of resistance, with a median dose of 600 mg daily (range, 400-800 mg). The median time from diagnosis of CML to the start of hydralazine and valproate was 53.6 months (range, 19-84 months). Two (25%) patients had a complete hematologic response, one (12.5%) had an major cytogenetic response, and one (12.5%) had a complete cytogenetic response. Three (37.5%) patients had stable disease, and only one (12.5%) patient failed to respond. At a median follow-up time of 18 months (range, 3-18 months), the median survival had not been reached, and the projected overall survival was 63%. All the patients had mild neurologic toxicity, including distal tremor and somnolence. No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the epigenetic drugs hydralazine and valproate revert the resistance to imatinib in patients with CML.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Currently liver biopsies are seldom performed, so diagnostic noninvasive markers would be useful. We evaluated 690 consecutive first liver transplant patients to assess whether peripheral eosinophilia could predict moderate-severe rejection and its course. A protocol biopsy was performed 6 +/- 2.5 days after transplant. A second biopsy was taken 6.1 +/- 2 days after the first in 487 patients to assess histological improvement. Liver function tests, peripheral eosinophil count and changes between first and second biopsy, were evaluated using logistic regression. Histological rejection was present in 532 patients (77.1%), with moderate (30.6%) and severe rejection (3.9%). Peripheral eosinophil count was strongly associated with moderate-severe rejection (OR = 2.15; P = 0.007), although the area under ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.58. On second biopsy, rejection improved in 119 (24.4%) patients. The delta in eosinophil count between the first and second biopsies was the only independent predictor of histological improvement (OR = 3.12; P = 0.001), irrespective of whether bolus steroids were used (OR = 2.77; P = 0.004); AUROC was 0.72. Peripheral eosinophilia is not sufficiently predictive of moderate-severe histological rejection.

Serum-based fungal detection assays have limitation of specificity or sensitivity. Studies on fungal DNA detection using real-time PCR in childhood leukaemia are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for IFI in paediatric acute leukaemia patients using real-time PCR. Of 100 randomised paediatric acute leukaemia patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole/amphotericin B, single peripheral whole blood sample in EDTA was used for Pan-AC real-time PCR assay (detects nine Candida and six Aspergillus species) in patients who failed prophylaxis due to proven, probable, possible or suspected fungal infections. PCR results were retrospectively correlated with clinical profile. Real-time PCR test was positive in 18/29 (62%) patients who failed prophylaxis. The only patient with proven IFI (mucormycosis), real-time PCR assay was negative. Real-time PCR was positive in 2/4 (50%) patients with possible and 16/24 (66.6%) suspected IFI and 5/10 (50%) patients with pneumonia. By applying method A/B, sensitivity and positive predictive value could not be commented due to unproven Aspergillus or Candida infections; specificity and negative predictive values (NPV) were 41% and 100% respectively; by method C (included episodes of possible IFI as true positive), sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 50%, 36%, 11% and 81% respectively.

However, transfusion-transmitted infections for which testing is not currently performed continue to be a concern. Among these untested agents is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which, in the transplant setting, is associated with lymphoproliferative disease, a potentially fatal cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of posttransplant EBV infection and its association with administration of blood products in children receiving a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) graft. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study sought to review charts of pediatric recipients of HSC grafts to collect information on the presence of EBV antibodies in the recipients' pretransplant sera and in HSC donor sera, incidence of posttransplant EBV infection, and patients' transfusion history. Cumulative incidence of posttransplant EBV infection was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods according to pretransplant serology. The association between blood products and EBV infection was measured by Cox regression models. RESULTS: The pretransplant EBV seroprevalence was 77.9% for recipients and 61.8% for graft donors. Virtually, all recipients received blood products during the peritransplant period. Among seronegative recipients, the 30- and 60-day cumulative incidences of posttransplant EBV infection were 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-17.3) and 13.4% (95% CI, 5.8%-29.4%), respectively. The 60-day cumulative incidence was 8.3% (95% CI, 2.2%-29.4%) when restricting the analysis to seronegative recipients of cord blood grafts. Importantly, there was a clear positive trend associating EBV infection to transfusion volume.

Imatinib discontinuation trials have led to two distinct outcomes: about 60% of patients experienced disease relapse within 6 months of treatment cessation, while the remaining 40% remained disease-free throughout the duration of follow-up. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these disparate clinical outcomes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We utilized molecular data from the ""Stop Imatinib"" trial together with a mathematical framework of chronic myeloid leukemia, based on a four-compartment model that can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to imatinib. This approach was complemented by statistical analyses to estimate system parameters and investigate whether chronic myeloid leukemia can be cured by imatinib therapy alone. RESULTS: We found that there are insufficient follow-up data from the ""Stop Imatinib"" trial in order to conclude whether the absence of a relapse signifies cure of the disease. We determined that selection of less aggressive leukemic phenotypes by imatinib therapy recapitulates the trial outcomes. This postulated mechanism agrees with the observation that most patients who have a complete molecular response after discontinuation of imatinib continue to harbor minimal residual disease, and might work in concert with other factors suppressing leukemic cell expansion when the tumor burden remains low. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides evidence for a mechanistic model of chronic myeloid leukemia selection by imatinib treatment and suggests that it may not be safe to discontinue therapy outside a clinical trial.",,"['Tang, Min', 'Foo, Jasmine', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Michor, Franziska']","['Tang M', 'Foo J', 'Gonen M', 'Guilhot J', 'Mahon FX', 'Michor F']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120314,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/03/16 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.062844 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.062844 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Oct;97(10):1553-61. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.062844.

Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family and suppresses apoptosis. Survivin also functions as a subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex for regulating mitosis with Aurora-B. Survivin and Aurora-B play an important role in maintaining genome stability. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase in disease progression and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the expression levels of these two genes in CD34(+) cells prepared from 64 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemic blasts from 50 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Survivin and Aurora-B expression levels were highly correlated with the type of myelodysplastic syndrome, were much higher in refractory anemia with excess blasts-1, refractory anemia with excess blasts-2, and secondary acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndrome than in normal control, and increased during disease progression. There was a significant correlation between these expression levels and the International Prognostic Scoring System. Interestingly, these levels were remarkably higher in patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes than in those with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing that high levels of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase expression in CD34(+) cells are distinctive molecular features of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and secondary acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndrome. Marked upregulation of Survivin and Aurora-B kinase may contribute to genetic instability and disease progression of myelodysplastic syndromes.

Tumor cells may activate blood coagulation proteases through the expression of procoagulant activities. However, specific information about the thrombin generation potential of malignant tissues is lacking. In this study we applied a single global coagulation test, the calibrated automated thrombogram assay, to characterize the specific procoagulant phenotypes of different tumor cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Malignant hematologic cells (i.e. NB4, HEL, and K562) or solid tumor cells (i.e. MCF-7 breast cancer and H69 small cell lung cells) were selected for the study. The calibrated automated thrombo-gram assay was performed in normal plasma and in plasma samples selectively deficient in factor VII, XII, IX or X, in the absence or presence of a specific anti-tissue factor antibody. Furthermore, cell tissue factor levels were characterized by measuring antigen, activity and mRNA expression. RESULTS: In normal plasma, NB4 induced the highest thrombin generation, followed by MCF-7, H69, HEL, and K562 cells. The anti-tissue factor antibody, as well as deficiencies of factors VII, IX and XII affected the thrombin generation potential of malignant cells to different degrees, allowing differentiation of the two different pathways of blood clotting activation - by tissue factor or contact activation. The thrombin generation capacity of NB4 and MCF-7 cells was tissue factor-dependent, as it was highly sensitive to inhibition by anti-tissue factor antibody and factor VII deficiency, while the thrombin generation capacity of H69, HEL and K562 was contact activation-dependent, as no thrombin was generated by these cells in factor XII-deficient plasma. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the calibrated automated thrombogram assay is capable of quantifying, characterizing, and comparing the thrombin generation capacity of different tumor cells. This provides a useful tool for understanding the key factors determining the global pro-coagulant profile of tumors, which is important for addressing specific targeted therapy for the prevention of thrombosis and for cancer.",,"['Marchetti, Marina', 'Diani, Erika', 'ten Cate, Hugo', 'Falanga, Anna']","['Marchetti M', 'Diani E', 'ten Cate H', 'Falanga A']","['Division of Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120314,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Tests/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Factor X Deficiency/blood', 'Factor XII Deficiency/blood', 'Hemophilia B/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Thrombin/*metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/16 06:00,2012/12/13 06:00,['2012/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/13 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.055343 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.055343 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Aug;97(8):1173-80. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.055343.

Unfortunately, little is known about the variability of non-pharmacological anti-infective measures in children with cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: A web-based survey assessed institutional recommendations regarding restrictions of social contacts, pets and food and instructions on wearing face masks in public for children with standard- risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia during intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 336 institutions in 27 countries responded to the survey (range, 1-76 institutions per country; overall response rate 61%). Most institutions recommend that patients with acute myeloid leukemia avoid indoor public places and daycare, kindergarten and school, whereas recommendations for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia differ considerably by institution. In terms of restrictions related to pets, there was a wide variability between institutions for both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Most, but not all institutions do not allow children with either acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia to eat raw meat, raw seafood or unpasteurized milk. Whereas most institutions do not routinely recommend that patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia wear face masks in public, advice on this matter varies for patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

The effect of donor lymphocyte infusion is mediated by donor T cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens. T cells recognizing hematopoietic restricted minor histocompatibility antigens may induce selective graft-versus-leukemia reactivity, whereas broadly-expressed antigens may be targeted in graft-versus-host disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed in detail CD8(+) T-cell immunity in a patient with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia who responded to donor lymphocyte infusion with minimal graft-versus-host disease of the skin. CD8(+) T-cell clones specific for 4 HLA-B*40:01 restricted minor histocompatibility antigens were isolated which were identified by screening a plasmid cDNA library and whole genome association scanning. Detailed T-cell reactivity and monitoring experiments were performed to estimate the clinical and therapeutic relevance of the novel antigens. RESULTS: Three antigens were demonstrated to be expressed on primary leukemic cells of various origins as well as subtypes of non-malignant hematopoietic cells, whereas one antigen was selectively recognized on malignant hematopoietic cells with antigen presenting cell phenotype. Skin derived fibroblasts were only recognized after pre-treatment with IFN-gamma by two T-cell clones. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show evidence for different roles of the HLA-B*40:01 restricted minor histocompatibility antigens in the onset and execution of the anti-tumor response. All antigens may have contributed to a graft-versus-leukemia effect, and one minor histocompatibility antigen (LB-SWAP70-1Q) has specific therapeutic value based on its in vivo immunodominance and strong presentation on leukemic cells of various origins, but absence of expression on cytokine-treated fibroblasts.",,"['Griffioen, Marieke', 'Honders, M Willy', 'van der Meijden, Edith D', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'Lurvink, Ellie G A', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Griffioen M', 'Honders MW', 'van der Meijden ED', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Lurvink EG', 'Kester MG', 'van Bergen CA', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, C2-R, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

NK large granular lymphocyte expansions associated with improved survival have been described under monotherapy with the Bcr-Abl/Src inhibitor dasatinib, which inhibits NK cell functions in vitro. As Src kinases play a major role in inhibitory and activating signaling pathways of NK cells, both outcomes appear plausible. To clarify these contradictory observations and potentially enable the use of dasatinib as adjuvant, we analyzed how clinically relevant doses promote NK cell effector functions. Polyclonal human NK cells were studied ex vivo. Functional outcomes assessed included conjugate formation, calcium flux, receptor regulation, cytokine production, degranulation, cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction and signal transduction. While dasatinib inhibits NK cell effector functions during functional assays, 24 hr pretreatment of NK cells followed by washout of dasatinib, led to dose-dependent enhancement of cytokine production, degranulation marker expression and cytotoxicity against selected lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Mechanistically, this was neither due to an altered viability of NK cells nor increased NKG2D, LFA-1 or conjugate formation with target cells. Receptor proximal signaling events were inhibited. However, a slight time dependent enhancement of Vav phosphorylation was observed under certain circumstances. The shift in Vav phosphorylation level may be one major mechanism for NK cell activity enhancement induced by dasatinib. Our findings argue for a careful timing and dosing of dasatinib application during leukemia/lymphoma treatment to enhance NK cell immunotherapeutic efforts.",['Copyright (c) 2012 UICC.'],"['Hassold, Nicole', 'Seystahl, Katharina', 'Kempf, Kristina', 'Urlaub, Doris', 'Zekl, Michael', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Watzl, Carsten', 'Wischhusen, Jorg', 'Seggewiss-Bernhardt, Ruth']","['Hassold N', 'Seystahl K', 'Kempf K', 'Urlaub D', 'Zekl M', 'Einsele H', 'Watzl C', 'Wischhusen J', 'Seggewiss-Bernhardt R']","['Immune Recovery Section, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/analysis', 'Granzymes/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1/biosynthesis', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2/biosynthesis', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/analysis', 'Necrosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2012/03/16 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/03/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27537 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Sep 15;131(6):E916-27. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27537.

Our earlier study focused on the plasmid vector itself, but the cellular response to the system was still unknown. SP100 is a member of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. It is involved in many cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and the cellular intrinsic immune response against viral infection. In this study, we revealed that SP100 inhibited the Rep-dependent nonviral integration. Conversely, transient expression of Rep78 increased the degradation of SP100. This degradation was inhibited by treatment with MG132, an inhibitor of the ubiquitin proteasome. SP100 and Rep78 are both located in the nucleolus, which provides the spatial possibility for their interaction. Rep78 was coimmunoprecipitated with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-SP100 fusion protein but not EGFP, which verified the interaction between Rep78 and SP100. These results have enriched our knowledge about the cellular protein SP100 and Rep-dependent nonviral integration.

Cocco quotes four independent epidemiological studies excluding the existence of excesses of cancer mortality and incidence in the Salto di Quirra military area. Three questions are presented and discussed: why in this area, characterized by environmental pressures, where public anxiety and high risk perception have been report even before 2001, a specific surveillance program wasn't activated? why, after the reporting of congenital anomalies, there were neither epidemiological investigations nor a feasibility study about a registry? the ability of the four investigations quoted by Cocco was evaluated a priori?

It is now accepted that a number of pathological processes mediated by mechanical, neurohormonal, and cytokine routes acting on the cardiomyocyte and the non-cardiomyocyte compartments are responsible for myocardial remodeling in the context of arterial hypertension. For instance, cardiotrophin-1 is a cytokine member of the interleukin-6 superfamily, produced by cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes in situations of biomechanical stress that once secreted interacts with its receptor, the heterodimer formed by gp130 and gp90 (also known as leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta), activating different signaling pathways leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as well as myocardial fibrosis. Beyond its potential mechanistic contribution to the development of hypertensive heart disease, cardiotrophin-1 offers the opportunity for a new translational approach to this condition.

To identify new treatments we focused on postresection changes in microRNAs--short noncoding RNAs, which suppress target genes--and suggest a previously undiscovered role for microRNA-125a (mir-125a) in intestinal adaptation. METHODS: Rats underwent either 80% massive small bowel resection or transection and were harvested after 48 hours. Jejunum was harvested for microRNA microarrays, laser capture microdissection, and RNA and protein analysis. Mir-125a was overexpressed in intestinal epithelium-6 (crypt-derived) cells (IEC-6) and effects on proliferation and apoptosis determined using MTS and flow cytometry. Expression of potential targets of mir-125a in rat jejunum and IEC-6 cells was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RNA) and Western blotting (protein). RESULTS: Resection upregulated mir-125a and mir-214 by 2.4-folds and 3.2-folds, respectively. Highest levels of expression were noted in the crypt fraction. Mir-125a overexpression induced apoptosis and resultant growth arrest in IEC-6 cells. The expression of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 was downregulated in both mir-125a-overexpressing IEC-6 cells and in jejunum of resected rats, confirming Mcl-1 as a previously undiscovered target of mir-125a. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of mir-125a suppresses the prosurvival protein Mcl1, producing the increase in apoptosis known to accompany the proliferative changes characteristic of intestinal adaptation. Our data highlight a potential role for microRNAs as mediators of the adaptive process and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic options for short bowel syndrome.",,"['Balakrishnan, Anita', 'Stearns, Adam T', 'Park, Peter J', 'Dreyfuss, Jonathan M', 'Ashley, Stanley W', 'Rhoads, David B', 'Tavakkolizadeh, Ali']","['Balakrishnan A', 'Stearns AT', 'Park PJ', 'Dreyfuss JM', 'Ashley SW', 'Rhoads DB', 'Tavakkolizadeh A']","[""Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. anita.balakrishnan@doctors.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann Surg,Annals of surgery,0372354,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn214 microRNA,rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/pathology', 'Intestine, Small/metabolism/pathology/*surgery', 'Laser Capture Microdissection', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Short Bowel Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/03/16 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/03/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/SLA.0b013e31824b485a [doi]', '00000658-201204000-00020 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Surg. 2012 Apr;255(4):747-53. doi: 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31824b485a.,,,,,PMC4116096,"['P30 DK040561/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK047326/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5 R01 DK047326/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-DK040561/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['GEO/GSE26542'],,,['NIHMS602165'],,,,,,,

Mast cell responses mediated by the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor FcepsilonRI can be enhanced by co-activation of additional receptors such as CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1). To examine the downstream effects of FcepsilonRI-CCR1 costimulation, rat basophilic leukemia cells stably transfected with CCR1 (RBL-CCR1 cells) were sensitized and activated with antigen and/or the CCR1 ligand CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 3. Gene and protein expression were determined at 3h and 24h post-activation, respectively, using GeneChip and Luminex bead assays. Gene microarray analysis demonstrated that 32 genes were differentially regulated in response to costimulation, as opposed to stimulation with antigen or CCL3 alone. The genes most significantly up-regulated by FcepsilonRI-CCR1 costimulation were Ccl7, Rgs1, Emp1 and RT1-S3. CCL7 protein was also expressed at higher levels 24h after dual receptor activation, although RGS1, EMP1 and RT1-S3 were not. Of the panel of chemokines and cytokines tested, only CCL2, CCL7 and interleukin (IL)-6 were expressed at higher levels following costimulation. IL-6 expression was seen only after FcepsilonRI-CCR1 costimulation, although the amount expressed was very low.

However, angiogenesis plays also an important role in hematological malignancies. We have analyzed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the leukemic blast cells and microvessel density (MVD) in the bone marrow biopsy samples of the patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Bone marrow MVD of the patients with ALL was significantly higher compared with normal controls and complete remission (P<0.001), but slightly lower than in patients with relapsed ALL (P>0.05). The bone marrow blast VEGF expression was significantly higher in newly diagnosed ALL patients, with predominant strong VEGF expression as compared with complete remission patients (who had negative or weak VEGF expression) (P<0.05), whereas initial values were slightly lower than in relapsed patients. There was a strong positive correlation between VEGF expression and MVD at presentation of ALL. Stronger expression of VEGF on blast cells indicates shorter overall survival in ALL. Furthermore, initial values of MVD had positive correlation with overall survival and leukemia-free survival (P=0.024 and P=0.017, respectively). Our data suggest that increased angiogenesis (confirmed by immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in leukemic blasts), and MVD may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ALL with prognostic implications.

Recent studies showed that prohibitins are up-regulated upon T cell activation and play an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. In the present study, we found that a considerable proportion of prohibitin-1 and -2 induced in response to T cell activation was expressed on the surface of activated T cells. When mouse and human T cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, prohibitins expressed on the cell surface were increased significantly, peaking at 48 h after stimulation. Stimulation of mouse T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies also remarkably induced the cell surface expression of prohibitins. Their expression on the cell surface was also detected in T cell leukemia cells such as Jurkat cells. In Jurkat cells, prohibitin-1 and -2 were co-localized with CD3 on the cell surface, and anti-CD3 antibody-induced signaling, the MAP kinase cascade, was inhibited on treatment with protein A magnetic beads co-conjugated with anti-CD3 antibody and anti-prohibitin-1 or anti-prohibitin-2 antibody.

The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML. METHODS: We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients. RESULTS: We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML.

The genetic changes that underlie progression from the myelodysplastic syndromes to secondary AML are not well understood. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of seven paired samples of skin and bone marrow in seven subjects with secondary AML to identify somatic mutations specific to secondary AML. We then genotyped a bone marrow sample obtained during the antecedent myelodysplastic-syndrome stage from each subject to determine the presence or absence of the specific somatic mutations. We identified recurrent mutations in coding genes and defined the clonal architecture of each pair of samples from the myelodysplastic-syndrome stage and the secondary-AML stage, using the allele burden of hundreds of mutations. RESULTS: Approximately 85% of bone marrow cells were clonal in the myelodysplastic-syndrome and secondary-AML samples, regardless of the myeloblast count. The secondary-AML samples contained mutations in 11 recurrently mutated genes, including 4 genes that have not been previously implicated in the myelodysplastic syndromes or AML. In every case, progression to acute leukemia was defined by the persistence of an antecedent founding clone containing 182 to 660 somatic mutations and the outgrowth or emergence of at least one subclone, harboring dozens to hundreds of new mutations. All founding clones and subclones contained at least one mutation in a coding gene. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all the bone marrow cells in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and secondary AML are clonally derived. Genetic evolution of secondary AML is a dynamic process shaped by multiple cycles of mutation acquisition and clonal selection. Recurrent gene mutations are found in both founding clones and daughter subclones.

Both cell populations have different molecular signatures that play a major role in determining their sensitivity to therapy. Contemporary approaches to treating CLL are heavily reliant on cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. However, none of the current treatment regimens can be considered curative. Pharmacological CDK inhibitors have extended the repertoire of potential drugs for CLL. Multi-targeted CDK inhibitors affect CDKs involved in regulating both cell cycle progression and transcription. Their interference with transcriptional elongation represses anti-apoptotic proteins and, thus, promotes the induction of apoptosis. Importantly, there is evidence that treatment with CDK inhibitors can overcome resistance to therapy.

Accordingly, the requirements to remission quality assessment are changed too. In particular the assessment of minimal residual disease is obligatory. To assess minimal residual disease in terms of quantity in case of chronic B-cell lymphatic leukemia the technique of polymerase chain reaction was applied in real time with patient-specific primers from the area of V-D-J combinations of genes of heavy chain of immunoglobulin. The study included samples from 60 patients suffering of chronic B-cell lymphatic leukemia. In 15 of them (25%), it was impossible to apply neither the sequence analysis of genes of heavy chain of immunoglobulin nor the fitting of patient-specific primer. The results of quantitative determination of minimal residual disease were obtained in 45 patients (55 tests). The minimal residual disease was detected in 30 of 55 samples (54.5%) and was not detected in 25 of 55 samples (45.5%). At the same time, the quantitative determination of minimal residual disease was implemented in regard to the initial level of neoplastic cells. The method sensitivity qualified by serial dilutions, consisted 10(-5) or 1 neoplastic cell to 100 000 normal cells. The comparative analysis was applied to the results of determination of minimal residual disease using two methods -polymerase chain reaction in real time using patient-specified primers and four-color flow cytofluometry. The determination of minimal residual disease with both methods was implemented in 37 patients (45 tests). The results of both methods matched in 93.3% (42 tests out of 45) with maximal disparity of one degree. Then Spearman factor consisted 0.87 (p < 0.0001). In 3 out of 45 tests (6.7%) neoplastic cells were detected with only one method. In the first case, it was the method of four-color flow cytofluometry and in other two cases it was polymerase chain reaction in real time. Therefore, the detection of minimal residual disease under chronic B-cell lymphatic leukemia using the method of polymerase chain reaction in real time is rather sensitive and specific and correlates with the results received with the method of four-color flow cytofluometry.

In view of its poor solubility and erratic absorption, several investigations have focused on developing analogues with more desirable physicochemical profiles. Here, we investigated the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of meisoindigo with respect to its antiproliferative activity on leukemic K562 cells and found that appending a phenalkyl side chain onto the lactam NH resulted in analogues that retained good activity. Furthermore, analogues in which the phenyl ring was substituted with a basic heterocycle were significantly more soluble than meisoindigo while retaining acceptable antiproliferative profiles. The most promising analogue (E)-1-(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl)-[3,3'-biindolinylidene]-2,2'-dione (5-4) is more potent than meisoindigo across a panel of malignant cells, with at least 40 times greater solubility than meisoindigo, little or no tendency to aggregate in solution and capable of significantly extending the lifespans of animals with K562 induced xenografts. Mechanistically, it induced apoptotic cell death and disrupted the progression of K562 cells from the G(1) to G(2) phase. Taken together, our findings highlighted the feasibility of addressing the physicochemical deficits of the isoindigo scaffold by systematic modifications which was achieved without overt loss of growth inhibitory activity.","['Copyright (c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Oncology Cooperative Group was faced with an ethical dilemma regarding sharing genetic data from a completed genome-wide association study (GWAS) that was conducted as part of a large, multicenter breast cancer clinical trial with a national database: the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes National Center for Biotechnology Information (dbGaP). METHODS: The CALGB Ethics Committee conducted a series of multidisciplinary meetings and teleconferences involving patient advocates, bioethicists, clinical researchers, and clinical oncologists to evaluate the ethical issues raised by this case and to identify lessons for improving informed consent to future genetics research in oncology trials. RESULTS: The Ethics Committee recommended that GWAS data be provided to dbGaP consistent with documented consent for future use of tissue among trial participants. Ethical issues, including adequacy of informed consent to future research, limitations of privacy in modern genetics research, the potential impact of population-based genetics research on health disparities, and recontact of research participants for clinical care or further research, were identified as major ethical considerations in this area. CONCLUSIONS: Although modern standards for informed consent should not prohibit research or sharing of data consistent with participant's intent and the public interest, there is an urgent need for national consensus on the appropriate use of archived tissue and standardized informed consent for future research among cancer clinical trial participants.",['Copyright (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.'],"['Peppercorn, Jeffrey', 'Shapira, Iuliana', 'Deshields, Teressa', 'Kroetz, Deanna', 'Friedman, Paula', 'Spears, Patricia', 'Collyar, Deborah E', 'Shulman, Lawrence N', 'Dressler, Lynn', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M']","['Peppercorn J', 'Shapira I', 'Deshields T', 'Kroetz D', 'Friedman P', 'Spears P', 'Collyar DE', 'Shulman LN', 'Dressler L', 'Bertagnolli MM']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. jeffrey.peppercorn@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120313,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Databases as Topic/*ethics', 'Ethics Committees', 'Genetic Research/*ethics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination/*ethics', 'Informed Consent/ethics/*standards', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Risk Factors', 'United States']",2012/03/15 06:00,2012/12/14 06:00,['2012/03/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27515 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Oct 15;118(20):5060-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27515.

METHODS: This was a population-based, multicenter study of 523 newly diagnosed AYA survivors (ages 15-39 years) of germ cell cancer (n = 204), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 131), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 142), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 21), or sarcoma (n = 25) from 7 National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. Age at diagnosis was categorized into 3 groups (ages 15-20 years, 21-29 years, and 30-39 years). RESULTS: Respondents (43% response rate), on average (+/-standard deviation), were aged 29 = 6.7 years, and most patients (80.1%) were not receiving treatment at the time the completed the survey. With modest differences between the age groups, the most prevalent areas of life impacted in a negative way were financial, body image, control over life, work plans, relationship with spouse/significant other, and plans for having children. Endorsement of positive life impact items also was evident across the 3 age groups, particularly with regard to relationships, future plans/goals, and health competence.

However, more than 30 % of patients with CML in chronic phase do not respond adequately to Imatinib and the drug seems not to affect the quiescent pool of BCR-ABL positive leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Therefore, despite encouraging clinical results, Imatinib can still not be considered a curative treatment option in CML. We recently reported downregulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in Imatinib treated K562 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of eIF5A by siRNA in combination with Imatinib has been shown to exert synergistic cytotoxic effects on BCR-ABL positive cell lines. Based on the structure of known deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) inhibitors such as CNI-1493, a drug design approach was applied to develop potential compounds targeting DHS. Here we report the biological evaluation of selected novel (DHSI-15) as compared to established (CNI-1493, deoxyspergualin) DHS inhibitors. We show that upon the compounds tested, DHSI-15 and deoxyspergualin exert strongest antiproliferative effects on BCR-ABL cells including Imatinib resistant mutants. However, this effect did not seem to be restricted to BCR-ABL positive cell lines or primary cells. Both compounds are able to induce apoptosis/necrosis during long term incubation of BCR-ABL positive BA/F3 derivates. Pharmacological synergism can be observed for deoxyspergualin and Imatinib, but not for DHSI-15 and Imatinib. Finally we show that deoxyspergualin is able to inhibit proliferation of CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients. We conclude that inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) can be supportive for the anti-proliferative treatment of leukemia and merits further investigation including other cancers.",,"['Ziegler, Patrick', 'Chahoud, Tuhama', 'Wilhelm, Thomas', 'Pallman, Nora', 'Braig, Melanie', 'Wiehle, Valeska', 'Ziegler, Susanne', 'Schroder, Marcus', 'Meier, Chris', 'Kolodzik, Adrian', 'Rarey, Matthias', 'Panse, Jens', 'Hauber, Joachim', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Ziegler P', 'Chahoud T', 'Wilhelm T', 'Pallman N', 'Braig M', 'Wiehle V', 'Ziegler S', 'Schroder M', 'Meier C', 'Kolodzik A', 'Rarey M', 'Panse J', 'Hauber J', 'Balabanov S', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Klinik fur Onkologie, Hamatologie und Stammzelltransplantation, Universitatsklinikum der RWTH, Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120314,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '9SGW2H1K8P (semapimod)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.- (deoxyhypusine synthase)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/03/15 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/03/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-012-9810-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Dec;30(6):2274-83. doi: 10.1007/s10637-012-9810-1.

However, several issues need revisiting, including the criteria for identification of BCR stereotypy and its actual frequency as well as the identification of ""CLL-biased"" features in BCR Ig stereotypes. To this end, we examined 7596 Ig VH (IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ) sequences from 7424 CLL patients, 3 times the size of the largest published series, with an updated version of our purpose-built clustering algorithm. We document that CLL may be subdivided into 2 distinct categories: one with stereotyped and the other with nonstereotyped BCRs, at an approximate ratio of 1:2, and provide evidence suggesting a different ontogeny for these 2 categories. We also show that subset-defining sequence patterns in CLL differ from those underlying BCR stereotypy in other B-cell malignancies. Notably, 19 major subsets contained from 20 to 213 sequences each, collectively accounting for 943 sequences or one-eighth of the cohort.

Although such compounds inhibit cell proliferation, their effects on cell survival, an important determinant of clinical response, are less distinct. Using a broad panel of myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples, we show that dual PI3K and mTOR inhibition can induce cell death. The effects are most marked in cells expressing the t(4;14) translocation, whereas t(11;14) cells are largely resistant. Using specific inhibitors of individual pathway components, we show that optimal induction of cell death requires inhibition of both PI3K and mTOR. This is due to a PI3K-independent component of mTOR activation downstream of the MAP kinase pathway. Novel mTOR kinase inhibitors, which block both TORC1 and TORC2 complexes thereby also reducing Akt activity, are less effective than dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors because of feedback activation of PI3K signalling. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors sensitise t(4;14) and t(14;16), but not t(11;14), expressing cells to the cytotoxic effects of dexamethasone. We have identified a robust cytogenetic biomarker for response to PI3K/mTOR inhibition--these results will inform the design and prioritisation of clinical studies with novel inhibitors in genetic subgroups of myeloma.",,"['Stengel, C', 'Cheung, C W', 'Quinn, J', 'Yong, K', 'Khwaja, A']","['Stengel C', 'Cheung CW', 'Quinn J', 'Yong K', 'Khwaja A']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120314,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/03/15 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/03/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201269 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.69 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Aug;26(8):1761-70. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.69.

A previous study demonstrated that absence of the Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 led to increased hepatocyte apoptosis and development of liver tumors in mice. Since Mcl-1 not only inhibits the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis but can also inhibit cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair, it remains to be proven whether the tumor suppressive effects of Mcl-1 are mediated by prevention of apoptosis. METHODS: We examined liver tumor development, fibrogenesis, and oxidative stress in livers of hepatocyte-specific knockout (KO) of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL, another key antagonist of apoptosis in hepatocytes. We also examined the impact of additional KO of Bak, a downstream molecule of Mcl-1 towards apoptosis but not the cell cycle or DNA damage pathway, on tumor development, hepatocyte apoptosis, and inflammation. RESULTS: Bcl-xL KO led to a high incidence of liver tumors in 1.5-year-old mice, similar to Mcl-1 KO. Bcl-xL- or Mcl-1-deficient livers showed higher levels of TNF-alpha production and oxidative stress than wild-type livers at as early as 6 weeks of age and oxidative DNA damage at 1.5 years. Deletion of Bak significantly inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis in Mcl-1 KO mice and reduced the incidence of liver cancer, coinciding with reduction of TNF-alpha production, oxidative stress, and oxidative DNA damage in non-cancerous livers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest that chronically increased apoptosis in hepatocytes is carcinogenic and offer genetic evidence that inhibition of apoptosis may suppress liver carcinogenesis in chronic liver disease.","['Copyright (c) 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

DR15 has also been associated with favorable outcomes (reduced acute graft-versus-host disease [aGVHD] and relapse) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. To elucidate the impact of DR15 on transplantation outcomes, we conducted a retrospective study of 2891 recipients of first allogeneic stem cell transplant from HLA-matched sibling donors for the treatment of acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) between 1990 and 2007. All patients received conventional myeloablative conditioning, T-replete grafts, and cyclosporine plus methotrexate-based GVHD prophylaxis. DNA-based HLA typing allowed categorization of 732 patients (25.3%) as positive and 2159 patients (74.7%) as negative for DRB1*15:01 or *15:02 (DR15). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the HLA DR15 positive and negative groups. In univariate analysis, HLA-DR15 status had no impact on neutrophil engraftment, aGVHD, chronic GVHD (cGVHD), treatment-related mortality, relapse, disease-free survival, or overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, DR15 status showed no significant difference in aGVHD, cGVHD, OS, or relapse.

CML cells are protected from cytotoxic insults, including those by TKIs, through various collaborative BCR-ABL1- mediated and -independent mechanisms, as well as cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic molecular mechanisms. These protective mechanisms include overlapping cell signaling pathways for normal hematopoietic proliferation, modulation of molecules associated with the BCL2 family protein-regulated programmed cell death pathway, autophagic cell protection capability, bone marrow environment-mediated cell protective signaling, abnormally upregulated genetic instability and other BCR-ABL1- independent kinase activities.

Difficulties in establishing the diagnosis continue to delay antifungal therapy, and this has been shown to adversely impact on survival. Apart from ongoing attempts to improve early recognition, effective chemoprophylaxis of invasive fungal infections remains a goal of high priority in populations with disease-related incidence rates of 10% or higher. These include patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, recurrent leukaemias and those following allogeneic HSCT. Incidence rates in other paediatric cancer entities, including autologous HSCT, are considerably lower and do not justify the general implementation of antifungal prophylaxis. The difficulties in obtaining a timely diagnosis, the consequences of infectious morbidity on delaying anticancer treatment, and mortality rates >20% and >50% for invasive yeast and mould infections, respectively, provide a clear rationale for antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk populations. However, while antifungal prophylaxis has become part of infectious disease supportive care algorithms in most paediatric leukaemia and allogeneic transplantation programmes, antifungal prophylaxis remains a topic of controversy, with no clear consensus amongst different centres and groups. This is largely based on the limited paediatric data, with only a small number of meaningful studies, and on the fact that the scientific evidence for the benefit of antifungal prophylaxis has been generated exclusively by prospective, randomized, clinical phase III trials conducted in adults with comparable, but not similar conditions. In this article, we briefly review the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections in children and adolescents with cancer and following HSCT; delineate regulatory principles of paediatric drug development with relevant examples for their successful implementation with new antifungal compounds; provide information on the pharmacology and paediatric development of current antifungal compounds; discuss for each compound the evidence for effectiveness as primary or secondary antifungal prophylaxis in adults and the pertinent data published in paediatric patients; and conclude by providing practical options for prophylaxis in children and adolescents with haematological malignancies and following allogeneic HSCT.",,"['Tragiannidis, Athanasios', 'Dokos, Charalampos', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Groll, Andreas H']","['Tragiannidis A', 'Dokos C', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Groll AH']","['Second Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University, AHEPA Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention/methods', 'Child', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Opportunistic Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/03/15 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2012/03/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2165/11599810-000000000-00000 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2012 Mar 26;72(5):685-704. doi: 10.2165/11599810-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to determine the anticancer effect of a polyphenol-rich Aronia melanocarpa juice (AMJ) containing 7.15 g/L of polyphenols in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cell line, and, if so, to clarify the underlying mechanism and to identify the active polyphenols involved. AMJ inhibited cell proliferation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M phase, and caused the induction of apoptosis. These effects were associated with an upregulation of the expression of tumor suppressor p73 and active caspase 3, and a downregulation of the expression of cyclin B1 and the epigenetic integrator UHRF1. AMJ significantly increased the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and caused the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Treatment with intracellular ROS scavengers prevented the AMJ-induced apoptosis and upregulation of the expression of p73 and active caspase 3. The fractionation of the AMJ and the use of identified isolated compounds indicated that the anticancer activity was associated predominantly with chlorogenic acids, some cyanidin glycosides, and derivatives of quercetin. AMJ treatment also induced apoptosis of different human lymphoblastic leukemia cells (HSB-2, Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM). In addition, AMJ exerted a strong pro-apoptotic effect in human primary lymphoblastic leukemia cells but not in human normal primary T-lymphocytes. Thus, the present findings indicate that AMJ exhibits strong anticancer activity through a redox-sensitive mechanism in the p53-deficient Jurkat cells and that this effect involves several types of polyphenols. They further suggest that AMJ has chemotherapeutic properties against acute lymphoblastic leukemia by selectively targeting lymphoblast-derived tumor cells.",,"['Sharif, Tanveer', 'Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Auger, Cyril', 'Minker, Carole', 'Kim, Jong-Hun', 'Etienne-Selloum, Nelly', 'Bories, Pierre', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich', 'Lobstein, Annelise', 'Bronner, Christian', 'Fuhrmann, Guy', 'Schini-Kerth, Valerie B']","['Sharif T', 'Alhosin M', 'Auger C', 'Minker C', 'Kim JH', 'Etienne-Selloum N', 'Bories P', 'Gronemeyer H', 'Lobstein A', 'Bronner C', 'Fuhrmann G', 'Schini-Kerth VB']","['UMR 7213 CNRS, Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120308,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Photinia/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2012/03/14 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0032526 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15518 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e32526. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032526.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 21,626 persons age 0 to 22 years were enrolled onto COG ALL clinical trials from 1990 to 2005, representing 55.8% of ALL cases estimated to occur among US persons younger than age 20 years during this period. This period was divided into three eras (1990-1994, 1995-1999, and 2000-2005) that included similar patient numbers to examine changes in 5- and 10-year survival over time and the relationship of those changes in survival to clinical covariates, with additional analyses of cause of death. RESULTS: Five-year survival rates increased from 83.7% in 1990-1994 to 90.4% in 2000-2005 (P < .001). Survival improved significantly in all subgroups (except for infants age </= 1 year), including males and females; those age 1 to 9 years, 10+ years, or 15+ years; in whites, blacks, and other races; in Hispanics, non-Hispanics, and patients of unknown ethnicity; in those with B-cell or T-cell immunophenotype; and in those with National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard- or high-risk clinical features. Survival rates for infants changed little, but death following relapse/disease progression decreased and death related to toxicity increased. CONCLUSION: This study documents ongoing survival improvements for children and adolescents with ALL. Thirty-six percent of deaths occurred among children with NCI standard-risk features emphasizing that efforts to further improve survival must be directed at both high-risk subsets and at those children predicted to have an excellent chance for cure.",,"['Hunger, Stephen P', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Carroll, William L']","['Hunger SP', 'Lu X', 'Devidas M', 'Camitta BM', 'Gaynon PS', 'Winick NJ', 'Reaman GH', 'Carroll WL']","[""University of Colorado School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045, USA. stephen.hunger@childrenscolorado.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120312,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', '*Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2012/03/14 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.37.8018 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.37.8018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 May 10;30(14):1663-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.37.8018.

AIMS: To provide an evidence-based assessment of the burden of occupational and environmental-related cancers in China in 2005. METHODS: The population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated based on the assumption of no occupational agent exposure. Relative risk estimates for specific cancers of interest and prevalence of exposure were mainly derived from large-scale studies. Data on cancer incidence and mortality was obtained from the Third National Death Cause Survey and cancer registries in China. RESULTS: We estimated that a total of 48,511 deaths of cancer were attributable to occupational agents in China in 2005, with 34,975 among men (3.1% of all cancer deaths) and 13,536 among women (2.1%). A total of 59,410 incident cases of cancer were attributable to occupational agents in China in 2005, with 42,724 among men (2.8% of all cancer incident cases) and 16,686 among women (1.6%). The highest PAF was observed for mesothelioma with asbestos, followed by leukaemia, bladder and lung cancers. Indoor radon was responsible for 0.2% of lung cancer-related deaths among men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational agents represent an important cause of cancer, but indoor radon plays a relatively limited role in cancer causes in China.

Comparative gene expression analysis of the Fas-resistant and Fas-sensitive clones revealed several genes that were aberrantly expressed in the Fas-resistant clones. One of the genes, esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (ECRG4), contained a VDAC2-like domain that might be associated with apoptotic signals. In the present study, we examined the subcellular localization and function of ECRG4 in Fas-mediated apoptosis. By confocal fluorescence microscopy, ECRG4-EGFP fusion protein was detected in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in gene-transfected HeLa cells. Overexpression of ECRG4 in Fas-sensitive Jurkat cells inhibited mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, leading to resistance against Fas-induced apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis was also suppressed in ECRG4-overexpressing Jurkat cells. Immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that ECRG4 is associated with procaspase-8. The inhibitory mechanism included the inhibition of caspase-8 activity and Bid cleavage. Since ECRG4 expression is downregulated in activated T cells, our results suggest that ECRG4 is a novel antiapoptotic gene which is involved in the negative regulation of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in T cells.",,"['Matsuzaki, Junichi', 'Torigoe, Toshihiko', 'Hirohashi, Yoshihiko', 'Kamiguchi, Kenjiro', 'Tamura, Yasuaki', 'Tsukahara, Tomohide', 'Kubo, Terufumi', 'Takahashi, Akari', 'Nakazawa, Emiri', 'Saka, Eri', 'Yasuda, Kazuyo', 'Takahashi, Shuji', 'Sato, Noriyuki']","['Matsuzaki J', 'Torigoe T', 'Hirohashi Y', 'Kamiguchi K', 'Tamura Y', 'Tsukahara T', 'Kubo T', 'Takahashi A', 'Nakazawa E', 'Saka E', 'Yasuda K', 'Takahashi S', 'Sato N']","['Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1 West-17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120312,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (ECRG4 protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2012/03/14 06:00,2012/08/11 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs118 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs118 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2012 May;33(5):996-1003. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs118.

Cotreatment with minimally toxic concentrations of carfilzomib (i.e., 2-6 nmol/L) and subtoxic concentrations of obatoclax (0.05-2.0 mumol/L) synergistically increased apoptosis in multiple DLBCL cell lines and increased lethality toward primary human DLBCL but not normal CD34(+) cells. Synergistic interactions were associated with sharp increases in caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, p-JNK induction, upregulation of Noxa, and AKT dephosphorylation. Combined treatment also diminished carfilzomib-mediated Mcl-1 upregulation whereas immunoprecipitation analysis revealed reduced associations between Bak and Mcl-1/Bcl-xL and Bim and Mcl-1. The carfilzomib/obatoclax regimen triggered translocation, conformational change, and dimerization of Bax and activation of Bak. Genetic interruption of c-jun-NH(2)-kinase (JNK) and Noxa by short hairpin RNA knockdown, ectopic Mcl-1 expression, or enforced activation of AKT significantly attenuated carfilzomib/obatoclax-mediated apoptosis. Notably, coadministration of carfilzomib/obatoclax sharply increased apoptosis in multiple bortezomib-resistant DLBCL models.

Patients carrying the FLT3-ITD but not the FLT3-TKD mutation have a significantly worse prognosis. Therefore, both FLT3 mutations seem to exert different biologic functions. FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD has been shown to induce robust activation of the STAT5 signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms leading to differential STAT5 activation and show that FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD uses SRC to activate STAT5. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments revealed an exclusive interaction between SRC but not other Src family kinases and FLT3-ITD, which is mediated by the SRC SH2 domain. We identified tyrosines 589 and 591 of FLT3-ITD to be essential for SRC binding and subsequent STAT5 activation. Using site-specific Abs, we found that both residues were significantly more strongly phosphorylated in FLT3-ITD compared with FLT3-TKD.

At present, little is known about how dasatinib influences nonmalignant cells. In the present study, we tested the effect of dasatinib on functional responses of normal mature human neutrophils. Dasatinib completely blocked integrin- and Fc-receptor-mediated neutrophil functions, with the lowest IC(50) values below 10nM under serum-free conditions. Dasatinib caused a partial inhibition of neutrophil responses triggered by G-protein-coupled receptors and had a moderate effect on neutrophil responses triggered by microbial compounds. Whereas dasatinib inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis under static conditions in 2 dimensions, it did not affect migration under flow conditions or in 3-dimensional environments. Dasatinib did not have any major effect on phagocytosis or killing of bacteria by neutrophils. Adhesion of human neutrophils in the presence of whole serum was significantly inhibited by 50-100nM dasatinib, which corresponds to the reported serum concentrations in dasatinib-treated patients. Finally, ex vivo adhesion of mouse peripheral blood neutrophils was strongly reduced after oral administration of 5 mg/kg of dasatinib.

Myeloid leukemia factors (MLFs) constitute a poorly characterized family of conserved proteins whose founding member, MLF1, has been associated with acute myeloid leukemia in humans. To gain insight into the functions of this family, we investigated the role of the Drosophila MLF homolog during blood cell development. Here we report that mlf controls the homeostasis of the Drosophila hematopoietic system. Notably, mlf participates in a positive feedback loop to fine tune the activity of the RUNX transcription factor Lozenge (LZ) during development of the crystal cells, one of the two main blood cell lineages in Drosophila. At the molecular level, our data in cell cultures and in vivo strongly suggest that MLF controls the number of crystal cells by protecting LZ from degradation. Remarkably, it appears that the human MLF1 protein can substitute for MLF in the crystal cell lineage. In addition, MLF stabilizes the human oncogenic fusion protein RUNX1-ETO and is required for RUNX1-ETO-induced blood cell disorders in a Drosophila model of leukemia. Finally, using the human leukemic blood cell line Kasumi-1, we show that MLF1 depletion impairs RUNX1-ETO accumulation and reduces RUNX1-ETO-dependent proliferation.

METHODS: This prospective study included 118 patients diagnosed with malignant disease for the first time during pregnancy over an 8-year period (March 2003-March 2011). Outcome of neonates born to mothers who received chemotherapy during pregnancy was studied and compared with a control group. RESULTS: The commonest cancer type diagnosed during pregnancy (56/118 = 47.45 %) was breast carcinoma followed by lymphoma/leukemia (32 = 27.12 %). Gynecological tumors (all ovarian) represented 10.16 %, soft tissue tumors 5.08 %, colorectal 4.23 %, thyroid 2.54 % and others 3.38 %. Sixty-one (51.64 %) women received chemotherapy (average 3 +/- 2 cycles) during the second and third trimesters. The incidence of neonatal survival, preterm birth, small for gestational age and congenital malformations was not significantly different between women who received chemotherapy during pregnancy and the control group. Five (4.23 %) women with advanced disease died during or shortly after termination of pregnancy.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib effectively treats CML, but acquired resistance can develop because of BCR-ABL mutations. Mechanisms for acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations are not fully understood. Using a novel culture model of CML acquired resistance, we show that inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase by small molecule inhibitors or gene knockdown blocks acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and relapse of CML cells on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. SIRT1 knockdown also suppresses de novo genetic mutations of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase gene in CML and non-CML cells upon treatment with DNA damaging agent camptothecin. Although SIRT1 can enhance cellular DNA damage response, it alters functions of DNA repair machineries in CML cells and stimulates activity of error-prone DNA damage repair, in association with acquisition of genetic mutations. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of SIRT1 for promoting mutation acquisition in cancer, and have implication for targeting SIRT1 to overcome CML drug resistance.",,"['Wang, Z', 'Yuan, H', 'Roth, M', 'Stark, J M', 'Bhatia, R', 'Chen, W Y']","['Wang Z', 'Yuan H', 'Roth M', 'Stark JM', 'Bhatia R', 'Chen WY']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120312,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sirtuin 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/03/14 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201283 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Jan 31;32(5):589-98. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.83.

DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or CD2, and presence of KITD816V. RISK STRATIFICATION: The prognostic relevance of the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of SM has recently been confirmed. Classification of SM patients into indolent (SM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis. MANAGEMENT: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-alpha (+/-corticosteroids) can control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in KITD816-unmutated patients.

METHODS: We merged gold-standard clinical trial data from 406 elderly cancer patients known to be treated on 1 of 6 Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) breast, colorectal, and lung cancer trials (trial numbers; 9344, 9730, 9235,9732, 80203, 89803) with their Medicare claims data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Comparing CMS chemotherapy codes to gold-standard CALGB treatment data, we estimated Medicare data's sensitivity at measuring the correct drugs and schedule for each of the multiagent chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: Overall 92% (375/406) of CALGB patients had contemporaneous CMS claims indicating receipt of chemotherapy. The overall sensitivity of CMS ambulatory claims for documenting treatment with the correct drugs and on the correct schedule (ie, all drugs had to be billed on the same day) for the 5 common multiagent chemotherapy regimens was 78% (275/354) for those potentially treated in the ambulatory setting. The sensitivity was similar for all treatment regimens: carboplatin and paclitaxel 83%, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin 80%, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) 76%, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide 75%, and cisplatin and etoposide 75%. CONCLUSIONS: We correctly identified at least 3-quarters of elderly Medicare cancer patients treated on a clinical trial with standard first-line multiagent chemotherapy regimens in the ambulatory setting by applying coding algorithms to their CMS claims.

Despite cooperative group therapeutic trials, there remains a paucity of large cohort data on which to conduct epidemiology and comparative effectiveness research studies. RESEARCH DESIGN: We designed a 3-step process utilizing International Classification of Diseases-9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9) discharge diagnoses codes and chemotherapy exposure data contained in the Pediatric Health Information System administrative database to establish a cohort of children with de novo ALL. This process was validated by chart review at 1 of the pediatric centers. RESULTS: An ALL cohort of 8733 patients was identified with a sensitivity of 88% [95% confidence interval (CI), 83%-92%] and a positive predictive value of 93% (95% CI, 89%-96%). The 30-day all cause inpatient case fatality rate using this 3-step process was 0.80% (95% CI, 0.63%-1.01%), which was significantly different than the case fatality rate of 1.40% (95% CI, 1.23%-1.60%) when ICD-9 codes alone were used. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of assembly and validation of a cohort of de novo ALL patients from a database representative of free-standing children's hospitals across the United States. Our data demonstrate that the use of ICD-9 codes alone to establish cohorts will lead to substantial patient misclassification and result in biased outcome estimates. Systematic methods beyond the use of just ICD-9 codes must be used before analysis to establish accurate cohorts of patients with malignancy. A similar approach should be followed when establishing future cohorts from administrative data.",,"['Fisher, Brian T', 'Harris, Tracey', 'Torp, Kari', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Shah, Ami', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Bailey, L Charles', 'Kersun, Leslie S', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Walker, Dana', 'Li, Yimei', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Fisher BT', 'Harris T', 'Torp K', 'Seif AE', 'Shah A', 'Huang YS', 'Bailey LC', 'Kersun LS', 'Reilly AF', 'Rheingold SR', 'Walker D', 'Li Y', 'Aplenc R']","[""*Division of Infectious Diseases daggerCenter for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia double daggerDepartment of Pediatrics section signCenter for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania parallelDivision of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia paragraph signDepartment of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Coding', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology/mortality', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/14 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MLR.0b013e31824deff9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Care. 2014 Jan;52(1):e1-6. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0b013e31824deff9.,,,,,PMC3381055,"['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133881-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS361287'],,,,,,,

Congenital deficiencies in IL-7 signaling result in profound immunodeficiency, polymorphisms in IL7Ralpha modulate susceptibility to autoimmune disease, and acquired somatic activating mutations in IL7Ralpha contribute to neoplastic transformation in B cell and T cell leukemia. In response to lymphopenia, IL-7 accumulates to supranormal levels, which alters T cell homeostasis by augmenting T cell reactivity toward self and cognate antigens. This physiologic response is now routinely exploited to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapies for cancer. Clinical trials of recombinant IL-7 have demonstrated safety and potent immunorestorative effects, and current studies are investigating whether rhIL-7 therapy can improve outcomes in chronic viral infection and in the context of cancer immunotherapies.

P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1, ABCB1), as well as a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, are plasma membrane transporters able to efflux a variety of substrates from the cell cytoplasm, including chemotherapeutic agents. The discovery of ABCB1 made available a potential target for pharmacologic down-regulation of efflux-mediated chemotherapy resistance. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a neoplasm characterized by proliferation of poorly differentiated myeloid progenitor cells, leukemic cells often express ABCB1 at high levels, which may lead to the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, AML seemed to be a likely cancer for which the addition of drug efflux inhibitors to the chemotherapeutic regimen would improve outcomes in patients. Despite this rational hypothesis, the majority of clinical trials evaluating this strategy have failed to reach a positive endpoint, most recently the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E3999 trial.

The present study aims to characterize the effects of extracts of this plant on cancer cells. RESULTS: We report that X. aethiopica extract prepared with 70% ethanol has antiproliferative activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. The IC50 was estimated at 12 mug/ml against HCT116 colon cancer cells, 7.5 mug/ml and > 25 mug/ml against U937 and KG1a leukemia cells, respectively. Upon fractionation of the extract by HPLC, the active fraction induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and apoptotic cell death. By using NMR and mass spectrometry, we determined the structure of the active natural product in the HPLC fraction as ent-15-oxokaur-16-en-19-oic acid.

Insights into B-cell receptor signaling and its role in regulating key cellular functions have shed light on candidate protein kinases that are aberrantly activated in CLL. In this regard, protein kinases are now considered as potential drug targets in CLL. AREA COVERED: This review has covered signaling pathways and associated protein kinases in CLL and the kinase inhibitors currently available in preclinical and clinical investigations. Individual protein kinases that are abnormally active in CLL and the functional consequences of their inhibition are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: A growing body of evidence suggests that protein kinases are druggable targets for patients with CLL. The emergence of novel and bio-available kinase inhibitors and their promising clinical activity in CLL underscore the oncogenic role of kinases in leukemogenesis. Further investigations directed towards their role as single agents or in combinations may provide insight into understanding the substantial role of kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways and their inhibition in B- CLL.",,"['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Gandhi V']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Houston, TX 77030, USA. kbalakr@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120309,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2012/03/14 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2012/03/14 06:00'],"['2012/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.668526 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Apr;21(4):409-23. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.668526.

Constitutively active FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) mutations define a promising target for therapeutic approaches using small molecule inhibitors. However, several point mutations of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) have been identified to mediate resistance towards FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3-TKI), including secondary mutations of FLT3. We investigated the cellular effects of the recently characterised FLT3-TKI ponatinib (AP24534) on murine myeloid cells transfected with FLT3-ITD with or without additional point mutations of the FLT3-TKD including the (so far) multi-resistant F691I mutation. Ponatinib effectively induced apoptosis not only in the parental FLT3-ITD cell line but also in all stably transfected subclones harbouring additional FLT3-TKD point mutations (N676D, F691I or G697R). These observations correlated with a strong inhibition of FLT3-ITD and its downstream targets STAT5, AKT and ERK1/2 upon ponatinib incubation, as determined by Western blotting. We conclude that ponatinib represents a promising FLT3-TKI that should be further investigated in clinical trials.

However, the anti-tumor effects of bufalin have not been demonstrated in lung cancer. In this study we used A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line as the experimental model to evaluate the potential of bufalin in lung cancer chemotherapy. A549 cells were treated with bufalin, then the proliferation was detected by MTT assay and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry analysis and Giemsa staining. In addition, A549 cells were treated by Akt inhibitor LY294002 in combination with bufalin and the activation of Akt and Caspase-3 as well as the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and livin were examined by Western blot analysis. The results showed that Bufalin inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells and induced the apoptosis of A549 cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that bufalin inhibited the activation of Akt. Moreover, bufalin synergized with Akt inhibitor to induce the apoptosis of A549 cells and this was associated with the upregulation of Bax expression, the downregulation of Bcl-2 and livin expression, and the activation of Caspase-3.

Olmesartan can protect endothelial cells from the impairment caused by various pathological stimulations. In the present study we investigated whether olmesartan decreased the impairment of endothelial cells induced by ox-LDL by exerting its effects on LOX-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of cultured endothelial cells of neonatal rats with ox-LDL for 24 h or infusion of ox-LDL in mice for 3 weeks led to the remarkable impairment of endothelial cells, including increased lactate dehydrogenase synthesis, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) and expression of apoptotic genes such as B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3.

We described herein the ability of ethoxyfagaronine (etxfag), a soluble synthetic derivative of fagaronine, to prevent leukemic cell adhesion to fibronectin peptide (FN/V). METHODS: Phosphorylation of fak and pyk2 were evaluated by immunoblotting. Labelled proteins were localized by confocal microscopy. PI 3-kinase activity was evaluated by in vitro kinase assay. RESULTS: Subtoxic concentration of etxfag reduced L1210 cell adhesion to FN/V dependently of beta1 integrin engagement. Etxfag impaired FN-dependent formation of beta1 clustering without modifying beta1 expression at the cell membrane. This was accompanied by a decrease of focal adhesion number, a diminution of fak and pyk2 phosphorylation at Tyr-576, Tyr-861 and Tyr-579, respectively leading to their dissociations from beta1 integrin and inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity. Etxfag also induced a cell retraction accompanied by a redistribution of phosphorylated fak and pyk2 in the perinuclear region and lipid raft relocalization. CONCLUSION: Through its anti-adhesive potential, etxfag, combined with conventional cytotoxic drugs could be potentially designed as a new anti-leukemic drug.",,"['Ouchani, F', 'Devy, J', 'Rusciani, A', 'Helesbeux, J J', 'Salesse, S', 'Letinois, I', 'Gras-Billart, D', 'Duca, L', 'Duval, O', 'Martiny, L', 'Charpentier, E']","['Ouchani F', 'Devy J', 'Rusciani A', 'Helesbeux JJ', 'Salesse S', 'Letinois I', 'Gras-Billart D', 'Duca L', 'Duval O', 'Martiny L', 'Charpentier E']","['Universite de Reims Champagne Ardenne, CNRS MEDyC, Laboratoire SiRMa, IFR Interactions Cellules-Microenvironnement, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),Analytical cellular pathology (Amsterdam),101541993,"['0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (N-methyl-12-ethoxy-2-hydroxy-3,8,9-trimethoxybenzo(c)phenanthridinium)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzophenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Focal Adhesions/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Integrin beta1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2012/03/13 06:00,2012/10/20 06:00,['2012/03/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['Q12440105330721N [pii]', '10.3233/ACP-2012-0055 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst). 2012;35(4):267-84. doi: 10.3233/ACP-2012-0055.,,,,,PMC4605501,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the cytotoxic effects of perifosine on CML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines were compared to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differences. METHODS: Human AML cell lines Kasumi-1 and HL-60, and the CML cell line K562 were used. Cell viability was quantitated using MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and Hoechst staining, which were followed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis, respectively. Caspase pathway activation and the expression of autophagy-related genes were examined using Western blot. Autophagy was studied using electron microscopy, the acridine orange staining method, and GFP-LC3 was examined with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: In contrast to AML cell lines, the CML cell lines K562 and K562/G (an imatinib-insensitive CML cell line) were resistant to perifosine (2.5-20 mumol/L) in respect to inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Perifosine (2.5, 5, and 10 mumol/L) inhibited Akt and its phosphorylation in AML cells, but not in CML cells. Treatment with perifosine (20 mumol/L) resulted in autophagy in CML cells as shown by the increased formation of acidic vesicular organelles and the accumulation of LC3-II. Treatment of CML cells with perifosine (5, 10, and 20 mumol/L) dose-dependently upregulated AGT5, but not Beclin 1 at the protein level. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (40 nmol/L) significantly suppressed the cell growth and induced apoptosis in CML cells treated with perifosine (20 mumol/L). CONCLUSION: Our results show that CML cell lines were resistant to the Akt inhibitor perifosine in vitro, which is due to perifosine-induced protective autophagy and upregulation of ATG5.",,"['Tong, Yin', 'Liu, Yan-yan', 'You, Liang-shun', 'Qian, Wen-bin']","['Tong Y', 'Liu YY', 'You LS', 'Qian WB']","['Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120312,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2012/03/13 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/03/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2011192 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2011.192 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2012 Apr;33(4):542-50. doi: 10.1038/aps.2011.192.

Resveratrol (RES), as a member of plant polyphenols, has gained considerable attention due to its ability to prevent cancer from progressing. In this study, the potential of RES to sensitize KG-1a cells to cytolysis of cytokine-induced killer cells (CIKs) through NKG2D ligands and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors were investigated. Twenty-five micromolars RES was found to inhibit approximately 50% of KG-1a cell growth and had the least growth-inhibition effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after 24 h. Utilizing cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-15 (IL-15) to activate PBMCs, we obtained substantial CD3 (+) CD56 (+) natural killer cell-like T lymphocytes that secreted cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and expressed NKG2D and TRAIL on their surfaces (i.e., cytokine-induced killer cells, CIKs). RES was shown to render KG-1a cells susceptible to CIK-mediated cytolysis estimated by LDH-release assay. This heightened sensitivity correlated with an increase in cell-surface expression of NKG2D ligands and death receptor 4 (DR4), coupled with a downregulation of cell-surface expression of decoy receptor 1 (DcR1) in KG-1a cells. Blocking NKG2D ligands or TRAIL with monoclonal antibodies could abrogate CIKs-mediated cytolysis. These results demonstrated that increased sensitivity of KG-1a cells, modulated by RES to alloreactive CIKs-mediated cytolysis is a phenomenon attributable to induced expression of NKG2D ligands and activation of TRAIL pathway. Thus, resveratrol combined with alloreactive CIKs merits clinical evaluation as a novel and effective immunotherapy strategy to eliminate residual leukemia stem cells.",,"['Hu, Liangshan', 'Cao, Donglin', 'Li, Yuhua', 'He, Yanjie', 'Guo, Kunyuan']","['Hu L', 'Cao D', 'Li Y', 'He Y', 'Guo K']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (ULBP1 protein, human)', '0 (ULBP2 protein, human)', '0 (ULBP3 protein, human)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Ligands', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/13 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/03/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['19601 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.19601 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2012 May;13(7):516-26. doi: 10.4161/cbt.19601.

However, among patients with non-APL AML, ATRA-based treatment has not been effective. Here we show that, through epigenetic reprogramming, inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also called KDM1A), including tranylcypromine (TCP), unlocked the ATRA-driven therapeutic response in non-APL AML. LSD1 inhibition did not lead to a large-scale increase in histone 3 Lys4 dimethylation (H3K4(me2)) across the genome, but it did increase H3K4(me2) and expression of myeloid-differentiation-associated genes. Notably, treatment with ATRA plus TCP markedly diminished the engraftment of primary human AML cells in vivo in nonobese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, suggesting that ATRA in combination with TCP may target leukemia-initiating cells. Furthermore, initiation of ATRA plus TCP treatment 15 d after engraftment of human AML cells in NOD-SCID gamma (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain deficiency) mice also revealed the ATRA plus TCP drug combination to have a potent anti-leukemic effect that was superior to treatment with either drug alone.

In a broad spectrum of cancers, the tumor suppressor PML undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation primed by CK2 phosphorylation. Here, we report that the SUMO E3-ligase inhibitor PIAS1 regulates oncogenic signaling through its ability to sumoylate PML and the PML-RARA oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation of PML promoted CK2 interaction and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of PML, attenuating its tumor suppressor functions. In addition, PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation of PML-RARA was essential for induction of its degradation by arsenic trioxide, an effective APL treatment. Moreover, PIAS1 suppression abrogated the ability of arsenic trioxide to trigger apoptosis in APL cells. Lastly, PIAS1 was also essential for PML degradation in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells, and PML and PIAS1 were inversely correlated in NSCLC cell lines and primary specimens.

Histologic evaluation revealed subtotal replacement of the right tonsil by a high-grade epithelioid neoplasm displaying extensive ulceration, necrosis, and primitive vasoformation. Immunohistochemistry showed strong/diffuse expression of pancytokeratin antibodies KL-1 and Lu5, cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 19, vimentin, CD31, ERG, and Freund leukemia integration site 1 (FLI-1).

Within months, the patient underwent surgical resection of multiple bleeding intraoral and gastrointestinal metastases. She is currently alive with disease 9 months from diagnosis. To our knowledge, this case represents the first well-documented primary epithelioid angiosarcoma of the tonsil. The strong cytokeratin expression in epithelioid angiosarcomas represents a diagnostic pitfall.

All patients had their first BM relapse within 3 years from diagnosis. Cox regression models were constructed to examine for differences in transplant outcome by donor source. Risks of grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), when compared to HLA-matched sibling transplants, were higher after matched unrelated donor BM (relative risk [RR], 2.42; P = .001; RR, 5.12; P < .001, respectively), mismatched BM (RR, 3.24; P < .001; RR, 5.19; P < .001, respectively), and cord blood (RR, 2.67; P < .001; RR, 2.54; P = .024, respectively) transplants. Although nonrelapse mortality was higher after transplantation of mismatched unrelated donor BM and cord blood, there were no differences in leukemia-free survival (LFS) between HLA-matched sibling and any of the unrelated donor transplantations.

Many of these therapies have been compared against chlorambucil, but have not been directly compared against each other. There is currently no agreed upon standard therapeutic regimen for treatment-naive CLL. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to November 2011 of therapies for previously untreated CLL. We conducted a network meta-analysis using fixed and random effect statistical models to estimate differences between shape and scale parameters of progression-free survival (PFS) curves for each competing therapy. We used the parameter estimates and a Weibull distribution to project mean PFS for each therapy option. RESULTS: Five RCTs were included in our comparison network. Overall, patients were younger (59-65 years), had good performance status based on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale (ECOG 0-1), and earlier stage disease (Rai 0-II or Binet A or B). The combination regimen fludarabine with cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) was estimated to yield mean PFS of 76 months (95% CrI: 60, 91), FC 60 months (46, 73), fludarabine 38 months (27, 49), alemtuzumab 24 months (15, 32), and chlorambucil 23 months (15, 32). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that FCR has relatively higher potential of preventing disease progression in younger, healthier, treatment-naive CLL patients and should be considered an optimal initial treatment strategy for this patient population. However, because estimates are based on model simulation, additional studies of FCR are necessary to clinically validate its therapeutic potential.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, in the present study, we determined the involvement of the angiotensin receptor in the proliferation and differentiation of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II) significantly increased DNA synthesis in mouse iPS cells cultured in a medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Pretreatment of the cells with either candesartan (a selective Ang II type 1 receptor [AT(1)R] antagonist) or Tempol (a cell-permeable superoxide scavenger) significantly inhibited Ang II-induced DNA synthesis. Treatment with Ang II significantly increased JAK/STAT3 phosphorylation. Pretreatment with candesartan significantly inhibited Ang II- induced JAK/STAT3 phosphorylation. In contrast, induction of mouse iPS cell differentiation into Flk-1-positive mesodermal progenitor cells was performed in type IV collagen (Col IV)- coated dishes in a differentiation medium without LIF. When Col IV-exposed iPS cells were treated with Ang II for 5days, the expression of Flk-1 was significantly increased compared with that in the cells treated with the vehicle alone. Pretreatment of the cells with both candesartan and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) significantly inhibited the Ang II- induced increase in Flk-1 expression. Treatment with Ang II enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in Col IV- exposed iPS cells. These results suggest that the stimulation of mouse iPS cells with AT(1)R may enhance LIF-induced DNA synthesis, by augmenting the generation of superoxide and activating JAK/STAT3, and that AT(1)R stimulation may enhance Col IV-induced differentiation into mesodermal progenitor cells via p38 MAPK activation.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Their receptor utilization was examined to define the common receptor usage of these disparate viral Envs. We demonstrate that the receptor usage of CP extends to HuPAR-2 but not to the porcine receptor PoPAR, the cognate receptor for PERV-A. Reciprocal interference between virus expressing CP and PERV-A Envs was observed on human cells. Amino acid residues localized to within the putative second extracellular loop (ECL-2) of PAR-1 and PAR-2 are found to be critical for CP envelope function.

HTLV-1 belongs to the Retroviridae family, the Orthoretrovirinae subfamily and to the deltaretrovirus genus. HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4(+) lymphoid cells in vivo. Three molecules have been identified for binding and/or entry of HTLV-1: heparan sulfate proteoglycans, neuropilin-1, and glucose transporter 1. An efficient transfer of the virus from an infected cell to a target cell can occur through the formation of a viral synapse and/or by virofilm structure. As for all retroviruses, HTLV-1 genome possesses three major ORFs (gag, pol and env) encoding the structural and enzymatic proteins. HTLV-1 encodes also some regulatory and auxillary proteins including the tax protein with transforming activities and the HBZ protein which plays a role in the proliferation and maintenance of the leukemic cells. HTLV-1 is present throughout the world with clusters of high endemicity including mainly Southern Japan, the Caribbean region, areas in South America and in intertropical Africa. The worldwide HTLV-1 infected population is estimated to be around 10-20 million. HTLV-1 has three modes of transmission: (1): mother to child, mainly linked to prolonged breast-feeding; (2): sexual, mainly occurring from male to female and (3): contaminated blood products. HTLV-1 possesses a remarkable genetic stability. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of mainly two severe diseases: a malignant T CD4(+) cell lymphoproliferation, of very poor prognosis, named Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL), and a chronic neuro-myelopathy named Tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM). The lifetime risk among HTLV-1 carriers is estimated to be around 0.25 to 3%. TSP/HAM mainly occurs in adults, with a mean age at onset of 40-50 years and it is more common in women than in men. Blood transfusion is a major risk factor for TSP/HAM development. Clinically, TSP/HAM is mainly defined as a chronic spastic paraparesis and minor sensory signs. The onset is insidious with often gait disturbance and urinary symptoms. In more than 90% of the cases, the neurological features involve: spasticity and/or hyperreflexia of the lower extremities, urinary bladder disturbance, lower extremity muscle weakness, and in around 50% of the cases, sensory disturbances with low back pain. Central functions and cranial nerves are usually spared. The clinical course is generally progressive without remission. High levels of antibodies titers directed against HTLV-1 antigens are present in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A high HTLV-1 proviral load is frequently observed in the blood. Mild to moderate increase of proteins may be present in the CSF. However, intrathecal production of specific HTLV-1 antibody index provides additional data to support the diagnosis. Brain white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging are frequent. A mild atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord can also be observed. Pathologically, it is characterized by a chronic inflammation with perivascular lymphocytic cuffing and mild parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. The cells are mostly CD4(+) in early disease and mostly CD8(+) in latter disease. Pyramidal tract damage with myelin and axonal loss, mainly in the lower thoracic spinal cord are observed. TSP/HAM pathogenesis is still poorly understood and viral and host factors as the proviral load and the cellular immune response play a major role in disease progression. TSP/HAM can be associated with other HTLV-1 associated symptoms (uveitis, myositis, infective dermatitis). Therapy of TSP/HAM remains disappointing and symptomatic treatment remains still the mainstay of therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In a recent genome-wide association study, we identified SNPs - including one that created an estrogen response element near the 3' end of the T-cell leukemia 1A (TCL1A) gene - that were associated with musculoskeletal pain in women on adjuvant AI therapy for breast cancer. We also showed estrogen-dependent, SNP-modulated variation in TCL1A expression and, in preliminary experiments, showed that TCL1A could induce IL-17RA expression. In the present study, we set out to determine whether these SNPs might influence cytokine expression and effect more widely, and, if so, to explore the mechanism of TCL1A-related AI-induced side effects. METHODS: The functional genomic experiments performed included determinations of TCL1A, cytokine and cytokine receptor expression in response to estrogen treatment of U2OS cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines that had been stably transfected with estrogen receptor alpha. Changes in mRNA and protein expression after gene knockdown and overexpression were also determined, as was NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. RESULTS: Estradiol (E2) increased TCL1A expression and, in a TCL1A SNP-dependent fashion, also altered the expression of IL-17, IL-17RA, IL-12, IL-12RB2 and IL-1R2. TCL1A expression was higher in E2-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines with variant SNP genotypes, and induction of the expression of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes was mediated by TCL1A. Finally, estrogen receptor alpha blockade with ICI-182,780 in the presence of E2 resulted in greatly increased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, but only in cells that carried variant SNP genotypes. These results linked variant TCL1A SNP sequences that are associated with AI-dependent musculoskeletal pain with increased E2-dependent TCL1A expression and with downstream alterations in cytokine and cytokine receptor expression as well as NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. CONCLUSIONS: SNPs near the 3' terminus of TCL1A were associated with AI-dependent musculoskeletal pain. E2 induced SNP-dependent TCL1A expression, which in turn altered IL-17, IL-17RA, IL-12, IL-12RB2, and IL-1R2 expression as well as NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. These results provide a pharmacogenomic explanation for a clinically important adverse drug reaction as well as insights into a novel estrogen-dependent mechanism for the modulation of cytokine and cytokine receptor expression.",,"['Liu, Mohan', 'Wang, Liewei', 'Bongartz, Tim', 'Hawse, John R', 'Markovic, Svetomir N', 'Schaid, Daniel J', 'Mushiroda, Taisei', 'Kubo, Michiaki', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Kamatani, Naoyuki', 'Goss, Paul E', 'Ingle, James N', 'Weinshilboum, Richard M']","['Liu M', 'Wang L', 'Bongartz T', 'Hawse JR', 'Markovic SN', 'Schaid DJ', 'Mushiroda T', 'Kubo M', 'Nakamura Y', 'Kamatani N', 'Goss PE', 'Ingle JN', 'Weinshilboum RM']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120309,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (IL12RB2 protein, human)', '0 (IL17RA protein, human)', '0 (IL1R2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type II)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-12)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-17)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Aromatase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/genetics', 'Interleukin-17/genetics', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type II/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-12/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-17/genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/13 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/03/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr3137 [pii]', '10.1186/bcr3137 [doi]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2012 Mar 9;14(2):R41. doi: 10.1186/bcr3137.,,,,,PMC3446375,"['U19 GM61388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA116201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HG05137/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA77202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicity of current available drugs and inevitable emergence of multi-drug resistant strains makes things worse. In the present study a series of novel Biginelli-type pyrimidine compounds were evaluated as potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 agents using green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter single round HIV-1 infection assay. The rate of infected cells was monitored by flowcytometry. The effect of compounds on the cellular proliferation was considered as the cyotoxicity. The anti-HIV-1 active compounds were selected for HIV-1 replication and syncytium formation assays.

Results show that the active compounds were able to inhibit the retrovirus control as well. Analysis of structure of the studied compounds proved relationships with their anti-HIV-1 effects.

Benchmark drugs are cytarabine for acute myeloid leukemia and gemcitabine for pancreatic and lung cancer. Sapacitabine is a novel cytidine analog currently in development. This editorial focuses on the potential of new nucleoside analogs and on novel possibilities of gemcitabine. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with many faces, which shows a remarkable activity in a variety of cancers, most likely because it has a unique metabolism, a so-called self-potentiation. Gemcitabine is taken up by nucleoside transporters, is activated by deoxycytidine kinase and incorporated into both RNA and DNA. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and dCMP deaminase enhances its activation, while cytidine deaminase converts gemcitabine to its presumably inactive metabolite 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, which in its nucleotide form may inhibit thymidylate synthase. Gemcitabine is widely used in combination, predominantly with a platinum analog, with other combinations less frequently used or being explored. Standard administration of gemcitabine is with a 30-min weekly infusion at 1000 mg/m(2), but alternatives are being explored such as prodrugs (e.g., CO-1.01, which can bypass transport deficiency), the fixed-dose rate infusion (10 mg/m(2)/min), and local routes of administration by a 24-h hepatic artery infusion, by instillation in the bladder or by intraperitoneal administration to treat advanced ovarian cancer. Other alternatives for combinations of gemcitabine in ovarian cancer consist of increasing the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase with triapine or hydroxyurea. Gemcitabine's action on signaling also provides a rational concept for combination with signal transduction pathways.",,"['Muggia, Franco', 'Diaz, Isabela', 'Peters, Godefridus J']","['Muggia F', 'Diaz I', 'Peters GJ']",,['eng'],['Editorial'],20120309,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'W335P73C3L (sapacitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2012/03/13 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2012/03/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.666236 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Apr;21(4):403-8. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.666236.

The mean number of CNAs was 2.82 (range 0-14). Concordance with available G-band karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization was 93%. Based on three major protein-protein complexes disrupted by these CNAs, patients could be categorized into four distinct subgroups, defined by different underlying biological mechanisms relevant to the aetiology of childhood ALL. When recurrent CNAs were evaluated by an oncogenetic tree analysis classifying their sequential order, the most common genetic aberrations (deletions of 6q, 9p, 13q and X, and gains of 10 and 21) seemed independent of each other. Finally, we identified the most common regions with recurrent gains and losses, which comprise microRNA clusters with known oncogenic or tumour-suppressive roles.

These cells recognize a variety of pathogens, and the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) have been suggested as intracellular sensors of microbial components and cell injury/stress. Some NLR will upon activation form multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes that result in IL-1beta production. NLR mutations are associated with auto-inflammatory syndromes, and our previous data propose NLRP3 (Q705K)/CARD-8 (C10X) polymorphisms to contribute to increased risk and severity of inflammatory disease by acting as genetic susceptibility factors. These gene products are components of the NALP3 inflammasome, and approximately 6.5% of the Swedish population are heterozygote carriers of these combined gene variants. Since patients carrying the Q705K/C10X polymorphisms display leukocytosis, the aim of the present study was to find out whether the inflammatory phenotype was related to dysfunctional apoptosis and impaired clearance of neutrophils by macrophages. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients carrying the Q705K/C10X polymorphisms displayed significantly delayed spontaneous as well as microbe-induced apoptosis compared to matched controls. Western blotting revealed increased levels and phosphorylation of Akt and Mcl-1 in the patients' neutrophils. In contrast to macrophages from healthy controls, macrophages from the patients produced lower amounts of TNF; suggesting impaired macrophage clearance response. CONCLUSIONS: The Q705K/C10X polymorphisms are associated with delayed apoptosis of neutrophils. These findings are explained by altered involvement of different regulators of apoptosis, resulting in an anti-apoptotic profile.

Here, we for the first time link AR anti-cancer action with cell senescence in vitro and in vivo. First, AR-driven senescence was p53-independent. Instead, AR induced p21, which subsequently reduced DeltaN isoform of p63. Second, AR activation increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby suppressed Rb phosphorylation. Both pathways were critical for senescence as was proven by p21 and Rb knock-down and by quenching ROS with N-Acetyl cysteine and p63 silencing also mimicked AR-induced senescence. The two pathways engaged in a cross-talk, likely via PML tumor suppressor, whose localization to senescence-associated chromatin foci was increased by AR activation. All these pathways contributed to growth arrest, which resolved in senescence due to concomitant lack of p53 and high mTOR activity.

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (34 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 4 with lymphoblastic lymphoma) were included in the current study. The conditioning regimen was BuCy2 for 14 patients and BuFlu for the remaining 24 patients. Eight and 13 patients were high risk disease in the BuCy2 and BuFlu groups, respectively. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 56.5% and 55.2% and that of extensive chronic GVHD 17.0% and 55.6% (p = 0.018) for the BuFlu and BuCy2 groups, respectively. The 3-year relapse rate was 27.8% and 31.4% and 3-year overall survival 34.3% and 46.8% for the BuFlu and BuCy2 groups, respectively. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was significantly lower in the BuFlu group (16.9%) than in the BuCy2 group (57.1%, p = 0.010). In multivariate analyses, the BuFlu regimen was identified as an independent favorable risk factor for TRM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.036; p = 0.017) and extensive chronic GVHD (HR, 0.168; p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Our BuFlu regimen would appear to be an acceptable conditioning option for lymphoid malignancies, including high-risk diseases.

The other 619 (31.45%) samples were either WB negative or exhibited other patterns, mostly with unique p19 or p24 bands. DNA, extracted from peripheral blood buffy coat, was subjected to PCR using several primer pairs known to detect HTLV-1/2/3/4. Most DNAs from HTLV-1- and HTLV-seropositive individuals were PCR positive. In contrast, all the others, from persons with HTLV-2, HGIP, new WB, and other indeterminate patterns, were PCR negative.

HIV viral protein R (Vpr) is a potent apoptosis-inducing agent for primary monocytes. Because the biologically active Vpr is found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected patients, we investigated the apoptotic effect of Vpr on monocyte-derived macrophages and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated THP1 macrophages. Our results show that primary monocytes and THP1 cells develop resistance to Vpr-induced apoptosis following differentiation into macrophages. To determine the effect of Vpr on the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, we show that in contrast to the undifferentiated cells, Vpr did not down-regulate the expression of antiapoptotic inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and Bcl2 family members in macrophages, suggesting their involvement in resistance to Vpr-induced apoptosis. However, knocking down Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins induced spontaneous apoptosis with no impact on susceptibility to Vpr-induced apoptosis. In contrast, down-regulation of cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2 by using siRNAs and SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) mimetic sensitized macrophages to Vpr-induced apoptosis. Overall, our results suggest that resistance to Vpr-induced apoptosis is specifically mediated by cIAP1/2 genes independent of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which play a key role in maintaining cell viability.

Despite peritransplant prophylaxis, GVHD remains a significant cause of posthematopoietic stem cell transplantation morbidity and mortality. Traditional therapies have targeted T cells, yet immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) are critical in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Furthermore, DCs also have tolerogenic properties. Monitoring of DC characteristics may be predictive of outcome, and therapies that target DCs are innovative and promising. DCs may be targeted in vivo or tolerogenic (tol) DCs may be generated in vitro and given in the peritransplant period. Other cellular therapies, notably regulatory T cells (T(reg)) and mesenchymal stem cells, mediate important effects through DCs and show promise for the prevention and treatment of GVHD in early human studies. Therapies are likely to be more effective if they have synergistic effects or target both DCs and T cells in vivo, such as tolDCs or T(reg). Given the effectiveness of tolDCs in experimental models of GVHD and their safety in early human studies for type 1 diabetes, it is crucial that tolDCs be investigated in the prevention and treatment of human GVHD while ensuring conservation of graft-versus-leukemia effects.",,"['Stenger, Elizabeth O', 'Turnquist, Heth R', 'Mapara, Markus Y', 'Thomson, Angus W']","['Stenger EO', 'Turnquist HR', 'Mapara MY', 'Thomson AW']","['Starzl Transplantation Institute, Departments of Surgery and Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120307,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/03/10 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/03/10 06:00'],"['2012/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47759-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-364091 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 31;119(22):5088-103. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-364091.

Growth factor or insulin stimulation activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] to form phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)], which is rapidly dephosphorylated either by PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) to PtdIns(4,5)P(2), or by the 5-phosphatases (inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases), generating PtdIns(3,4)P(2). 5-phosphatases also hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P(2) forming PtdIns(4)P. Ten mammalian 5-phosphatases have been identified, which regulate hematopoietic cell proliferation, synaptic vesicle recycling, insulin signaling, and embryonic development. Two 5-phosphatase genes, OCRL and INPP5E are mutated in Lowe and Joubert syndrome respectively. SHIP [SH2 (Src homology 2)-domain inositol phosphatase] 2, and SKIP (skeletal muscle- and kidney-enriched inositol phosphatase) negatively regulate insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. SHIP2 polymorphisms are associated with a predisposition to insulin resistance. SHIP1 controls hematopoietic cell proliferation and is mutated in some leukemias. The inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatases, INPP4A and INPP4B degrade PtdIns(3,4)P(2) to PtdIns(3)P and regulate neuroexcitatory cell death, or act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer respectively. The Sac phosphatases degrade multiple phosphoinositides, such as PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3,5)P(2) to form PtdIns. Mutation in the Sac phosphatase gene, FIG4, leads to a degenerative neuropathy. Therefore the phosphatases, like the lipid kinases, play major roles in regulating cellular functions and their mutation or altered expression leads to many human diseases.",,"['Dyson, Jennifer M', 'Fedele, Clare G', 'Davies, Elizabeth M', 'Becanovic, Jelena', 'Mitchell, Christina A']","['Dyson JM', 'Fedele CG', 'Davies EM', 'Becanovic J', 'Mitchell CA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Wellington Rd, 3800, Clayton, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Subcell Biochem,Sub-cellular biochemistry,0316571,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.25 (myo-inositol-1 (or 4)-monophosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.66 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPP5D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems']",2012/03/10 06:00,2014/08/02 06:00,['2012/03/10 06:00'],"['2012/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-94-007-3012-0_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Subcell Biochem. 2012;58:215-79. doi: 10.1007/978-94-007-3012-0_7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CsA) is an effective and safe therapy for patients without undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of rabbit-ATG (r-ATG) combined with CsA as an intensive immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in children. METHODS: From January 2003 to November 2008, 46 children (30 boys and 16 girls), with a median age of 7 years (between 2 and 15 years) were diagnosed with acquired SAA. They received an IST of r-ATG combined with CsA. The average time was 3.4 months (ranging from 1 to 13 months). The effective rates 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment were 30.4, 65.2, 78.8, and 84.8%, respectively. After 2 years of follow-up, the response rate was 84.8% (39/46). No response was found in five cases and relapse was found in two. RESULTS: Among the five cases without response, two received unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are already disease-free and two died from infection caused by long-term dependence on infusion. No myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia was found among the patients. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that r-ATG combined with CsA as an intensive IST is effective and safe in treating acquired SAA in children.",,"['Chen, Chun', 'Xue, Hong-Man', 'Xu, Hong-Gui', 'Li, Yang', 'Huang, Ke', 'Zhou, Dun-Hua', 'Guo, Hai-Xia', 'Fang, Jian-Pei', 'Huang, Shao-Liang']","['Chen C', 'Xue HM', 'Xu HG', 'Li Y', 'Huang K', 'Zhou DH', 'Guo HX', 'Fang JP', 'Huang SL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 107, Yanjiang West Road, Guangzhou 510120, China. chunchencn@163.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120310,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Rabbits', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/03/10 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/03/10 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-012-1184-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2012 Jul;138(7):1105-11. doi: 10.1007/s00432-012-1184-4.

JMJD5 (jumonji C domain-containing 5) is a histone demethylase that specifically removes methyl moieties from dimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 and exerts a pro-proliferative effect on breast cancer cells. Here, we generated JMJD5 knockout mice in order to study the physiological significance of this enzyme. Whereas heterozygous knockout mice displayed no overt phenotype, homozygous JMJD5 knockouts died around day 10 of embryonal development. JMJD5(-/-) embryos showed delayed development already at E8.5 and were actively resorbed at E10.5. While strong JMJD5 expression was observed only in the yolk sac at E8.5, JMJD5 was robustly expressed in E10.5 embryos at several sites, including the heart and eye. Lack of JMJD5 resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the tumor suppressor p53. Concurrently, the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and the pro-apoptotic molecule Noxa, both of which are prominent p53 target genes, became strongly upregulated in JMJD5(-/-) embryos. Collectively, our data indicate that JMJD5 is essential during embryonal development and a repressor of p53 expression. The latter suggests that JMJD5 has oncogenic activity and accordingly JMJD5 is upregulated in leukemias and breast cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Telomerase activity plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and is associated with the prognosis of ATL patients. Interleukin (IL)-2 commonly promotes tumor growth in chronic ATL cells. The signaling pathways involved in IL-2-regulated telomerase activation were studied in ATL cells derived from chronic ATL patients. IL-2 challenge enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase (JAK)1-3 and STAT5, and induced JAK1 and JAK2 to associate with STAT5 in IL-2-dependent ATL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that STAT5 directly bound to the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. STAT5 short interfering RNA inhibited hTERT transcription in IL-2-stimulated ATL cells. Inhibitors of PI3K, HSP90, and mTOR reduced IL-2-induced hTERT mRNA, protein expression, and telomerase activity. AKT, HSP90, mTOR, S6 kinase, and hTERT immunoprecipitate from IL-2-stimulated cells contained telomerase activity, suggesting that hTERT directly interacts with, and is regulated by, these proteins. Binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to JAK2 was enhanced in an IL-2-dependent manner, indicating that JAK2 propagates activation signals from the IL-2 receptor and links hTERT activation to both the STAT5 and PI3K pathways. Finally, IL-2-induced activation of telomerase and STAT5 was observed in primary leukemic cells. These results indicate that IL-2 stimulation induces hTERT activation through the JAK/STAT pathway and the JAK/PI3K/AKT/HSP90/mTORC1 pathway in IL-2-responsive ATL cells.

We report 4 cases of pneumatosis intestinalis in patients undergoing cancer treatments that included cytotoxic agents and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These reports aim to provide insight into the clinical interpretation and pathogenesis of pneumatosis intestinalis in the setting of cancer treatments and demonstrate a potential association with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: Radiologists responsible for the interpretation of adult imaging at our tertiary care centre were surveyed to identify cases of pneumatosis intestinalis arising in the midst of cancer treatment. The case histories were reviewed by physicians with expertise in cancer treatment. RESULTS: Four cases of chemotherapy-related pneumatosis intestinalis were identified. The diagnosis was made in 1 patient during investigations undertaken for non-life-threatening abdominal symptoms and incidentally in 2 patients by abdominal imaging used to measure chemotherapy response. A fourth patient presented in a life-threatening manner, and abdominal imaging was symptom guided. Interestingly, 3 of the 4 patients were receiving treatments that included a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and this agent was the only identifiable potential etiology in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of pneumatosis intestinalis arising during cancer treatments is difficult to interpret because of the complex nature of the diseases and the treatments that often include combinations of cytotoxic agents and/or novel therapies. These reports demonstrate the importance of classifying this radiologic finding according clinical severity rather than etiology and underscore the need for continued observation for unexplained adverse effects when using novel therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Canadian Association of Radiologists.

The Scl +19 enhancer is active in HSCs and progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, and mast cells, but not mature erythroid cells. Here we demonstrate that in vivo deletion of the Scl +19 enhancer (Scl(Delta19/Delta19)) results in viable mice with normal Scl expression in mature hematopoietic lineages. By contrast, Scl expression is reduced in the stem/progenitor compartment and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the HSC and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor populations are enlarged in Scl(Delta19/Delta19) mice. The increase in HSC numbers contributed to enhanced expansion in bone marrow transplantation assays, but did not affect multilineage repopulation or stress responses. These results affirm that the Scl +19 enhancer plays a key role in the development of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, but is not necessary for mature hematopoietic lineages. Moreover, active histone marks across the Scl locus were significantly reduced in Scl(Delta19/Delta19) fetal liver cells without major changes in steady-state messenger RNA levels, suggesting post-transcriptional compensation for loss of a regulatory element, a result that might be widely relevant given the frequent observation of mild phenotypes after deletion of regulatory elements.","['Copyright (c) 2012 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Since 95% of T-LBL expresses TdT and TdT is expressed only in lymphoblasts, immunohistochemical demonstration of TdT is mandatory for the diagnosis of TLBL. However, little is known about the expression of other precursor cell molecules. A 58-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (RAEB) became overt acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). She was treated twice with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from her son. Nine months later, imaging modalities detected a soft tissue tumor around the left ileal bone. A biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor cells were malignant polymorphic lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli.

A set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) was developed to predict benzene exposure pattern for the filling station employees. Furthermore, a Physiology Based Pharmaco-Kinetic (PBPK) risk assessment model was developed in order to calculate the lifetime probability distribution of leukemia to the employees, fed by data obtained by the ANN model. Bayesian algorithm was involved in crucial points of both model sub compartments. The application was evaluated in two filling stations (one urban and one rural). Among several algorithms available for the development of the ANN exposure model, Bayesian regularization provided the best results and seemed to be a promising technique for prediction of the exposure pattern of that occupational population group. On assessing the estimated leukemia risk under the scope of providing a distribution curve based on the exposure levels and the different susceptibility of the population, the Bayesian algorithm was a prerequisite of the Monte Carlo approach, which is integrated in the PBPK-based risk model.

However, biweekly administration might be better tolerated due to the reduced peak drug concentrations. Therefore, we compared biweekly to triweekly docetaxel as first- or second-line chemotherapy for advanced HRPC in this prospective randomized multicenter trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 360 patients were randomly allocated to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) i.v. d1 q3 weeks (tT) or 50 mg/m(2) i.v. d1 and d 14, q4 weeks (bT) from March 2004 to May 2009. Oral prednisolone (10 mg/day) was administered in both groups. The groups were well balanced according to the WHO performance status in terms of mean age (70 vs. 68, range 45-87 years) and median serum PSA level at the time of study entry (109 vs. 98 mug/l, range 11-1490 mug/l). The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTF). ClinicalTrials.gov study identifier: NCT00255606. RESULTS: Ultimately, 158 patients (tT=79; bT=79) were included in this preplanned interim safety analysis; 567 and 487 cycles (equivalent to 1701 and 1948 weeks of treatment) were administered in the tT and bT groups, respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events (expressed as %/cycles) in tT /bT were neutropenia 20%/14%; infection with/without neutropenia 8%/3%; fatigue 3%/3%; febrile neutropenia 2%/1%; and bone pain 2%/1%. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the group tT (n=60, 10.6% of cycles) than in the group bT (n=29, 6.0%, p=0.012). One patient died due to coronary infarction, and another was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (both in the bT group). Thirty patients (38%) in the bT group and 22 patients (28%) in the tT group were still receiving treatment at 6 months (p=0.176).

In eukaryotes, IDPs are highly abundant and perform a wide range of biological functions, including regulation and signaling. Despite increased interest in understanding the structural biology of IDPs, questions remain regarding the mechanisms through which disordered proteins perform their biological function(s). In other words, what are the relationships between disorder and function for IDPs? Several excellent reviews have recently been published that discuss the structural properties of IDPs.1-3 Here, we discuss two IDP systems which illustrate features of dynamic complexes. In the first section, we discuss two IDPs, p21 and p27, which regulate the mammalian cell division cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). In the second section, we discuss recent results from Follis, Hammoudeh, Metallo and coworkers demonstrating that the IDP Myc can be bound and inhibited by small molecules through formation of dynamic complexes. Previous studies have shown that polypeptide segments of p21 and p27 are partially folded in isolation and fold further upon binding their biological targets. Interestingly, some portions of p27 which bind to and inhibit Cdk2/cyclin A remain flexible in the bound complex. This residual flexibility allows otherwise buried tyrosine residues within p27 to be phosphorylated by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Tyrosine phosphorylation relieves kinase inhibition, triggering Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus of p27. This, in turn, marks p27 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, unleashing full Cdk2 activity which drives cell cycle progression. p27, thus, constitutes a conduit for transmission of proliferative signals via posttranslational modifications. Importantly, activation of the p27 signaling conduit by oncogenic NRTKs contributes to tumorigenesis in some human cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)9 and breast cancer.10 Another IDP with important roles in human cancer is the proto-oncoprotein, Myc. Myc is a DNA binding transcription factor which critically drives cell proliferation in many cell types and is often deregulated in cancer. Myc is intrinsically disordered in isolation and folds upon binding another IDP, Max and DNA. Follis, Hammoudeh, Metallo and coworkers identified small molecules which bind disordered regions of Myc and inhibit its heterodimerization with Max. Importantly, these small molecules- through formation of dynamic complexes with Myc-have been shown to inhibit Myc function in vitro and in cellular assays, opening the door to IDP-targeted therapeutics in the future. The p21/p27 and Myc systems illustrate, from different perspectives, the role of dynamics in IDP function. Dynamic fluctuations are critical for p21/p27 signaling while the dynamic free state of Myc may represent a therapeutically approachable anticancer target. Herein we review the current state of knowledge related to these two topics in IDP research.",,"['Follis, Ariele Viacava', 'Galea, Charles A', 'Kriwacki, Richard W']","['Follis AV', 'Galea CA', 'Kriwacki RW']","[""Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction']",2012/03/09 06:00,2012/04/11 06:00,['2012/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4614-0659-4_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2012;725:27-49. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4614-0659-4_3.,,,,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2R01CA082491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '9P30CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the molecular and functional effects of pharmacological MEK inhibition in cell line models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and freshly isolated primary AML samples. The small-molecule, ATP-non-competitive, MEK inhibitor PD0325901 markedly inhibited ERK phosphorylation and growth of several AML cell lines and approximately 70 % of primary AML samples. Growth inhibition was due to G(1)-phase arrest and induction of apoptosis. Transformation by constitutively active upstream pathway elements (HRAS, RAF-1, and MEK) rendered FDC-P1 cells exquisitely prone to PD0325901-induced apoptosis. Gene and protein expression profiling revealed a selective effect of PD0325901 on ERK phosphorylation and compensatory upregulation of the RAF/MEK and AKT/p70( S6K ) kinase modules, potentially mediating resistance to drug-induced growth inhibition.

Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear. Here we utilized a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic method to analyze the 5-Aza-CdR-induced perturbation of protein expression in Jurkat-T cells at the global proteome scale. Among the approximately 2780 quantified proteins, 188 exhibited significant alteration in expression levels upon a 24-hr treatment with 5 mum 5-Aza-CdR. In particular, we found that drug treatment led to substantially reduced expression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) and farnesyl diphosphate farnesyltransferase (FDFT1), two important enzymes involved in de novo cholesterol synthesis. Consistent with this finding, 5-Aza-CdR treatment of leukemia (Jurkat-T, K562 and HL60) and melanoma (WM-266-4) cells led to a marked decrease in cellular cholesterol content and pronounced growth inhibition, which could be rescued by externally added cholesterol. Exposure of these cells to 5-Aza-CdR also led to epigenetic reactivation of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) gene. Additionally, suppression of DPP4 expression with siRNA induced elevated protein levels of FDPS and FDFT1, and increased cholesterol biosynthesis in WM-266-4 cells. Together, the results from the present study revealed, for the first time, that 5-Aza-CdR exerts its cytotoxic effects in leukemia and melanoma cells through epigenetic reactivation of DPP4 gene and the resultant inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in these cells.",,"['Zhang, Fan', 'Dai, Xiaoxia', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Zhang F', 'Dai X', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521-0403, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120307,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.5.1.10 (Geranyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.21 (Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Geranyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Melanoma', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2012/03/09 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33024-3 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M111.016915 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012 Jul;11(7):M111.016915. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M111.016915.

Among the 11 SUMO binding proteins identified was the conserved protein kinase BGLF4. The mutation of potential SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) in BGLF4 identified N- and C-terminal SIMs. The mutation of both SIMs changed the intracellular localization of BGLF4 from nuclear to cytoplasmic, while BGLF4 mutated in the N-terminal SIM remained predominantly nuclear. The mutation of the C-terminal SIM yielded an intermediate phenotype with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The transfer of BGLF4 amino acids 342 to 359 to a nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged reporter protein led to the relocalization of the reporter to the cytoplasm. Thus, the C-terminal SIM lies adjacent to a nuclear export signal, and coordinated SUMO binding by the N- and C-terminal SIMs blocks export and allows the nuclear accumulation of BGLF4. The mutation of either SIM prevented SUMO binding in vitro. The ability of BGLF4 to abolish the SUMOylation of the EBV lytic cycle transactivator ZTA was dependent on both BGLF4 SUMO binding and BGLF4 kinase activity. The global profile of SUMOylated cell proteins was also suppressed by BGLF4 but not by the SIM or kinase-dead BGLF4 mutant. The effective BGLF4-mediated dispersion of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies was dependent on SUMO binding. The SUMO binding function of BGLF4 was also required to induce the cellular DNA damage response and to enhance the production of extracellular virus during EBV lytic replication. Thus, SUMO binding by BGLF4 modulates BGLF4 function and affects the efficiency of lytic EBV replication.",,"['Li, Renfeng', 'Wang, Leyao', 'Liao, Gangling', 'Guzzo, Catherine M', 'Matunis, Michael J', 'Zhu, Heng', 'Hayward, S Diane']","['Li R', 'Wang L', 'Liao G', 'Guzzo CM', 'Matunis MJ', 'Zhu H', 'Hayward SD']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120307,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (BGLF4 protein, Epstein-Barr virus)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/*metabolism/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/chemistry/*enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/03/09 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00314-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00314-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 May;86(10):5412-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00314-12.

Imatinib (IM) effectively targets Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, but development of resistance to IM occurs with varying frequency. METHODS: Elucidation of the common regulatory pathway upstream of Bcr-Abl in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant CML cells is important for developing novel therapeutics against CML. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that IM preferentially inhibited the viability and Bcr-Abl expression in IM-sensitive K562 (K562) cells, but not in Bcr-Abl overexpressing IM-resistant K562 (K562R) cells. Both K562 and K562R cells expressed Shh preproprotein, cleaved Shh C-terminal and N-terminal peptides, as well as mRNA level of major Shh signaling molecules, including sonic hedgehog (Shh), patched (PTCH), smoothened (Smo) and Gli-1. Moreover, Gli-1 translocation into nucleus was evident in these two cell lines, suggesting that both K562 and K562R cells possess activated and major components of the Shh signaling pathway. Silencing of Gli-1 by interference RNA was accompanied by inhibition of Bcr-Abl protein expression. Pharmacological suppression of Bcr-Abl expression was restored by the Smo agonist purmorpharmine. Treatment of Shh peptide in both K562 and K562R cells not only increased Shh and Gli-1 expression, but also up-regulated Bcr-Abl expression. Resveratrol, a known Bcr-Abl inhibitor, reduced Gli-1 activation and inhibited the viability of CML cells.

To date, no cell lines exist, as CLL cells undergo rapid apoptosis when cultured in vitro, suggesting that a favorable in vivo microenvironment is required. To identify survival signals we cultured primary CLL peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at high density, which has previously been shown to dramatically improve survival. Using antibody arrays we measured the level of 42 cytokines in culture supernatants and showed that inerleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, CXCL2 and CCL2 were highly up-regulated in culture. This is the first report to describe a role for CCL2 and CXCL2 in CLL cell survival. Importantly, CXCL2, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly up-regulated in primary patient plasma. The addition of either CXCL2 or CCL2 enhanced CLL cell survival, while antibodies blocking these chemokines reduced survival. Co-culture of CLL cells and PBMC accessory cells separated by transwells provided a similar degree of survival protection compared to normal culture, whereas CLL cells cultured alone died rapidly. Interestingly, CCL2 and CXCL2 appeared to be produced by CLL cells but only when co-cultured with accessory cells. Thus, we speculate that accessory cells release soluble factors that promote the production of these pro-survival chemokines from CLL cells and physical interactions are not required. Our data support the concept that the CLL microenvironment is critical, and suggests that soluble factors are more important than physical interactions.",,"['Burgess, Melinda', 'Cheung, Catherine', 'Chambers, Lynne', 'Ravindranath, Karunya', 'Minhas, Gunjeet', 'Knop, Louise', 'Mollee, Peter', 'McMillan, Nigel A J', 'Gill, Devinder']","['Burgess M', 'Cheung C', 'Chambers L', 'Ravindranath K', 'Minhas G', 'Knop L', 'Mollee P', 'McMillan NA', 'Gill D']","['Diamantina Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CCL2/blood/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL2/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/blood/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/blood/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2012/03/09 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.672735 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Oct;53(10):1988-98. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.672735.

Acquired somatic mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been reported in some types of brain tumors and a small proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty newly diagnosed AML patients were analyzed for the presence of IDH1 and IDH2 heterozygous mutations by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) followed by direct sequencing. Clinical and biological characteristics were analyzed and correlated to the IDH mutational status. Coexisting mutations such as FLT3, PML-RARA, RAS, AML1, and NPM1 mutations were additionally explored. RESULTS: The prevalence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations was 8.7% (20/230) and 10.4% (24/230), respectively. Six missense mutations were identified among IDH1-mutated cases; p.R132H (n = 8), p.R132C (n = 6), p.R132S (n = 2), p.R132G (n = 2), p.R132L (n = 1), and p.I99M (n = 1). Two missense mutations were found in IDH2-mutated cases; p.R140Q (n = 20) and p.R172K (n = 4). No patients had dual IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. About 18% of AML with normal cytogenetics and 31% of acute promyelocytic leukemia had IDH mutations. Half of the IDH-mutated cohort had normal karyotype and the major FAB subtype was AML-M2. Interestingly, IDH1- and IDH2-mutated cases predominantly had NPM1 mutations (60-74%) as compared to the wild type (P < 0.001). Very few IDH-mutated cases had FLT3 and/or RAS abnormalities and none of them had AML1 mutations. Older age and higher median platelet counts were significantly associated with IDH2 mutations although the clinical impact of either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations on patients' overall survival could not be observed. CONCLUSION: Overall, 19% of newly diagnosed AML patients had alterations of IDH genes. No patients concurrently carried both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations suggesting that these mutations were mutually exclusive. NPM1 mutation appears as a major coexisting genetic mutation in IDH-mutated patients. Our present data failed to support the prognostic relevance of IDH mutations although alterations of these metabolic genes potentially have an important role in leukemia development.",,"['Chotirat, Sadudee', 'Thongnoppakhun, Wanna', 'Promsuwicha, Orathai', 'Boonthimat, Chetsada', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Chotirat S', 'Thongnoppakhun W', 'Promsuwicha O', 'Boonthimat C', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Department of Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120307,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

This complex process can be disrupted in diseases such as the leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders by oncogenes such as protein tyrosine kinases. The analysis of expression patterns for specific genes suggests that the regulation of protein expression can be achieved in a posttranslational fashion. Post-translational protein modification, such as phosphorylation and acetylation govern events in blood cell production and yet cannot be measured using conventional molecular biology approaches. For this reason a suite of techniques in mass spectrometry needs to be applied to define regulation and disregulation in normal and abnormal hematopoiesis. These approaches include discovery proteomics with relative quantification of thousands of proteins. Alternatively targeted examination of a single protein to identify its interaction partners or post-translational modifications using mass spectrometry reveals much mechanistic detail.

Thus, the place and usage of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in CML treatment--as a former ""nearly monopolistic"" therapeutic manner--is nowadays controversial. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results obtained in the treatment of CML patients, with a particular attempt to define parameters critical for clinical benefit and superior overall outcome following allogeneic SCT. METHODS: A total of 32 CML patients (27 in chronic phase and 5 with advanced disease), with female/male ratio 11/21, aged from 9 to 54 (32 in average) years, underwent allogeneic SCTs (1993 to 2009). The initial treatment for 25 patients was interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) with or without ARA-C, and additional 7 patients with no response to imatinib mesylat (IM). The time from diagnosis to SCT was approximately 12 (range 3-37) months. The patient were categorized according to the risk for the disease, transplant-related mortality (TRM) scoring system, and stem cell (SC) source. The basic conditioning regimen was a combination of busulphan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy-2). Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was typically prevented with cyclosporine-A (CsA) and methotrexate (MTX). RESULTS: Engraftment was observed in 26 (84.4%) patients, with polymorphonuclear (PMNs) and platelet (Plt) recovery on the 15th (range 10-22) and 19th (range 11-29) posttranspalnt days, respectively. Acute GvHD (aGvHD) had 13/26 (50%), and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) 10/21 (47.1%) patients. The incidence of overall TRM was 46.8% (15/32), while early death was noticed in 4 (12.5%) patients. A cause of death in 9 (28.1%) patients was cGvHD, in 2 (6.25%) patients infection, and in 3 (9.35%) cases disease-relapse was occurred. Fourteen (43.7%) of the patients are still alive, 9 from the low-risk group for TRM, with long-term survival from 1 to 16 years. Patients who received SCs from peripheral blood (PB) vs bone marrow (BM) had significantly faster engraftment (p < 0.05), lower oropharingeal mucositis rate (25% vs 70%; p < 0.05), but more frequent cGvHD (83.3% vs 30.3%; p < 0.05). A significantly improved (log-rank = 2.39; p < 0.01) overall survival (OS) was obtained in BM-setting. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study are in accordance with data from analogous clinical trials. Exactly, in the era of the new target therapy (TKI application), allogeneic SCT can be still a convenient therapeutic approach for well-selected CML-patients, especially for those with initial high-risk disease and lower probability of TRM.",,"['Stamatovic, Dragana', 'Balint, Bela', 'Tukic, Ljiljana', 'Elez, Marija', 'Tarabar, Olivera', 'Todorovic, Milena', 'Todoric-Zivanovic, Biljana', 'Ostojic, Gordana', 'Tatomirovic, Zeljka', 'Marjanovic, Slobodan', 'Malesevic, Milomir']","['Stamatovic D', 'Balint B', 'Tukic L', 'Elez M', 'Tarabar O', 'Todorovic M', 'Todoric-Zivanovic B', 'Ostojic G', 'Tatomirovic Z', 'Marjanovic S', 'Malesevic M']","['Military Medical Academy, Clinic of Hematology, Belgrade, Serbia. stamatovicm@sbb.rs']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/09 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2012/03/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2012 Jan;69(1):37-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cell microarray chip was used to detect spiked carcinoma cells among leukocytes. The chip, with 20,944 microchambers (105 microm width and 50 microm depth), was made from polystyrene; and the formation of monolayers of leukocytes in the microchambers was observed. Cultured human T lymphoblastoid leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cells were used to examine the potential of the cell microarray chip for the detection of spiked carcinoma cells. A T lymphoblastoid leukemia suspension was dispersed on the chip surface, followed by 15 min standing to allow the leukocytes to settle down into the microchambers. Approximately 29 leukocytes were found in each microchamber when about 600,000 leukocytes in total were dispersed onto a cell microarray chip. Similarly, when leukocytes isolated from human whole blood were used, approximately 89 leukocytes entered each microchamber when about 1,800,000 leukocytes in total were placed onto the cell microarray chip. After washing the chip surface, PE-labeled anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody and APC-labeled anti-CD326 (EpCAM) monoclonal antibody solution were dispersed onto the chip surface and allowed to react for 15 min; and then a microarray scanner was employed to detect any fluorescence-positive cells within 20 min. In the experiments using spiked carcinoma cells (NCI-H1650, 0.01 to 0.0001%), accurate detection of carcinoma cells was achieved with PE-labeled anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, verification of carcinoma cells in the microchambers was performed by double staining with the above monoclonal antibodies. CONCLUSION: The potential application of the cell microarray chip for the detection of CTCs was shown, thus demonstrating accurate detection by double staining for cytokeratin and EpCAM at the single carcinoma cell level.",,"['Yamamura, Shohei', 'Yatsushiro, Shouki', 'Yamaguchi, Yuka', 'Abe, Kaori', 'Shinohara, Yasuo', 'Tamiya, Eiichi', 'Baba, Yoshinobu', 'Kataoka, Masatoshi']","['Yamamura S', 'Yatsushiro S', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Abe K', 'Shinohara Y', 'Tamiya E', 'Baba Y', 'Kataoka M']","['Health Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120301,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule', 'Humans', 'Keratins/biosynthesis', 'Leukocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polystyrenes/chemistry', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",2012/03/08 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/03/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0032370 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21602 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(3):e32370. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032370.

The Scl/Map17 domain is flanked upstream by the ubiquitously expressed Sil gene and downstream by a cluster of Cyp genes active in liver, but the mechanisms responsible for delineating the domain boundaries remain unclear. Here we report identification of a DNaseI hypersensitive site at the 3' end of the Scl/Map17 domain and 45 kb downstream of the Scl transcription start site. This element is located at the boundary of active and inactive chromatin, does not function as a classical tissue-specific enhancer, binds CTCF and is both necessary and sufficient for insulator function in haematopoietic cells in vitro. Moreover, in a transgenic reporter assay, tissue-specific expression of the Scl promoter in brain was increased by incorporation of 350 bp flanking fragments from the +45 element.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has been implicated in self-renewal and cancer progression, and its components are overexpressed in many cancers. However, its role in cancer development and progression remains unclear. We used conditional alleles for the PRC2 components enhancer of zeste 2 (Ezh2) and embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) to characterize the role of PRC2 function in leukemia development and progression. Compared with wild-type leukemia, Ezh2-null MLL-AF9-mediated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) failed to accelerate upon secondary transplantation. However, Ezh2-null leukemias maintained self-renewal up to the third round of transplantation, indicating that Ezh2 is not strictly required for MLL-AF9 AML, but plays a role in leukemia progression. Genome-wide analyses of PRC2-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 demonstrated locus-specific persistence of H3K27me3 despite inactivation of Ezh2, suggesting partial compensation by Ezh1. In contrast, inactivation of the essential PRC2 gene, Eed, led to complete ablation of PRC2 function, which was incompatible with leukemia growth.

The micellar nanoparticles have been decorated with a high-affinity ""OA02"" peptide against alpha-3 integrin receptor to improve the tumor-targeting specificity which is overexpressed on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. ""Click chemistry"" was used to conjugate alkyne-containing OA02 peptide to the azide group at the distal terminus of the PEG chain in a representative PEG(5k)-CA(8) telodendrimer (micelle-forming unit). The conjugation of OA02 peptide had negligible influence on the physicochemical properties of PEG(5k)-CA(8) nanoparticles and as hypothesized, OA02 peptide dramatically enhanced the uptake efficiency of PEG(5k)-CA(8) nanoparticles (NP) in SKOV-3 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, but not in alpha-3 integrin-negative K562 leukemia cells. When loaded with paclitaxel, OA02-NPs had significantly higher in vitro cytotoxicity against both SKOV-3 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells as compared with nontargeted nanoparticles. Furthermore, the in vivo biodistribution study showed OA02 peptide greatly facilitated tumor localization and the intracellular uptake of PEG(5k)-CA(8) nanoparticles into ovarian cancer cells as validated in SKOV3-luc tumor-bearing mice. Finally, paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded OA02-NPs exhibited superior antitumor efficacy and lower systemic toxicity profile in nude mice bearing SKOV-3 tumor xenografts, when compared with equivalent doses of nontargeted PTX-NPs as well as clinical paclitaxel formulation (Taxol).

Little data are available concerning changes in disparity over time. Here, we examine changes in survival by race/ethnicity of patients with common cancers in two recent time periods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used modeled period analysis to determine relative survival (RS) for non-Hispanic white (nHw), African-American (AA), and Hispanic patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database diagnosed with common solid and hematological malignancies. RESULTS: Five-year RS improved overall and for nHw for each tumor examined, ranging from + 2% points (pancreatic cancer) to + 16.4% points [non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, (NHL)]. Greater improvement was observed for AA and Hispanics than nHw in breast and prostate cancer and NHL. Less improvement was observed for AA and Hispanics than for nHw for lung and pancreatic cancer. No statistically significant improvement was observed for AA and Hispanics with myeloma or acute leukemia. Survival disparities ranging from 0.5% points (myeloma) to 13.1% points (breast) between nHw and AA remained. CONCLUSIONS: Progress has been made in decreasing disparities in survival between nHw and minorities in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and NHL.

Previously, retroviral vector (RV)-mediated neonatal gene therapy reduced the clinical manifestations of MPS I and MPS VII in mice and dogs. However, sulfatases require post-translational modification by sulfatase-modifying factors. MPS VI cats were injected intravenously (i.v.) with a gamma RV-expressing feline 4S, resulting in 5 +/- 3 copies of RV per 100 cells in liver. Liver and serum 4S activity were 1,450 +/- 1,720 U/mg (26-fold normal) and 107 +/- 60 U/ml (13-fold normal), respectively, and were directly proportional to the liver 4S protein levels for individual cats. This study suggests that sulfatase-modifying factor (SUMF) activity in liver was sufficient to result in active enzyme despite overexpression of 4S. RV-treated MPS VI cats achieved higher body weights and longer appendicular skeleton lengths, had reduced articular cartilage erosion, and reduced aortic valve thickening and aortic dilatation compared with untreated MPS VI cats, although cervical vertebral bone lengths were not improved.

TET2 mutations are common in myeloid leukemia and were proposed to contribute to leukemogenesis through DNA methylation. To expand on this concept, we studied chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) samples. TET2 missense or nonsense mutations were detected in 53% (16/30) of patients. In contrast, only 1/30 patient had a mutation in IDH1 or IDH2, and none of them had a mutation in DNMT3A in the sites most frequently mutated in leukemia. Using bisulfite pyrosequencing, global methylation measured by the LINE-1 assay and DNA methylation levels of 10 promoter CpG islands frequently abnormal in myeloid leukemia were not different between TET2 mutants and wild-type CMML cases. This was also true for 9 out of 11 gene promoters reported by others as differentially methylated by TET2 mutations. We found that two non-CpG island promoters, AIM2 and SP140, were hypermethylated in patients with mutant TET2.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that influence gene expression by post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA. It is not yet clear how miRNAs are able to regulate the effectiveness of imatinib in CML. Here, we show that imatinib markedly inhibits expression of miR-30a in human CML cells. miR-30a is a potent inhibitor of autophagy by downregulating Beclin 1 and ATG5 expression. miR-30a mimic or knockdown of autophagy genes (ATGs) such as Beclin 1 and ATG5 by short hairpin RNA enhances imatinib-induced cytotoxicity and promotes mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast, knockdown of miR-30a by antagomir-30a increases the expression of Beclin 1 and ATG5, and inhibits imatinib-induced cytotoxicity. These findings indicate that dysregulation of miR-30a may interfere with the effectiveness of imatinib-mediated apoptosis by an autophagy-dependent pathway, thus representing a novel potential therapeutic target in CML.",,"['Yu, Y', 'Yang, L', 'Zhao, M', 'Zhu, S', 'Kang, R', 'Vernon, P', 'Tang, D', 'Cao, L']","['Yu Y', 'Yang L', 'Zhao M', 'Zhu S', 'Kang R', 'Vernon P', 'Tang D', 'Cao L']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China. yyaner8645@sina.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120307,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MIRN30b microRNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Beclin-1', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2012/03/08 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201265 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.65 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Aug;26(8):1752-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.65.

There is thus growing demand for diagnostic assays permitting the surveillance of donor/recipient chimerism posttransplant. Current techniques are heterogeneous, rendering uniform evaluation and comparison of diagnostic results between centers difficult. Leading laboratories from 10 European countries have therefore performed a collaborative study supported by a European grant, the EuroChimerism Concerted Action, with the aim to develop a standardized diagnostic methodology for the detection and monitoring of chimerism in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Following extensive analysis of a large set of microsatellite/short tandem repeat (STR) loci, the EuroChimerism (EUC) panel comprising 13 STR markers was established with the aim to optimally meet the specific requirements of quantitative chimerism analysis. Based on highly stringent selection criteria, the EUC panel provides multiple informative markers in any transplant setting. The standardized STR-PCR tests permit detection of donor- or recipient-derived cells at a sensitivity ranging between 0.8 and 1.6%. Moreover, the EUC assay facilitates accurate and reproducible quantification of donor and recipient hematopoietic cells.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an interaction between the Hh signaling pathway and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the HL60 and U937 cell lines. HL60 and U937 cells were treated with TGF-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and specific inhibitor of Smad3 (SIS3). The expression of Gli2 was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. The results showed that TGF-beta alone did not affect the Gli2 expression in HL60 cells, while it significantly reduced the level of Gli2 expression in U937 cells. TGF-beta+TNF-alpha reduced the expression of Gli2 in HL60 cells and U937 cells. The reduction in the level of Gli2 expression in U937 cells by TGF-beta+TNF-alpha was greater than that caused by TGF-beta alone. SIS3 inhibited the effect of TGF-beta.

Due to the unexpected and large scale of the accident, dosimetry techniques and practices were far from the optimum; personal dosimetry of cleanup workers (liquidators) was not complete, and there were no direct measurements of the exposures of members of the public.

In response, substantial efforts have been made to reconstruct doses for the main exposed cohorts, using a broad variety of newly developed methods: analytical, biological and physical (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of teeth, thermoluminescence of quartz) and modelling. This paper reviews the extensive experience gained by the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Academy of Medical Sciences, Ukraine in the field of retrospective dosimetry of large cohorts of exposed population and professionals. These dose reconstruction projects were implemented, in particular, in the framework of epidemiological studies, designed to follow-up the medical consequences of the Chernobyl accident and study health effects of ionizing radiation, particularly Ukrainian-American studies of cataracts and leukaemia among liquidators.",,"['Chumak, Vadim V']",['Chumak VV'],"['National Research Center for Radiation Medicine NAMS Ukraine 04050, Melnikova 53, Kiev, Ukraine. chumak@leed1.kiev.ua']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120306,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['*Artifacts', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Power Plants/*statistics & numerical data', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2012/03/08 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0952-4746(12)21121-8 [pii]', '10.1088/0952-4746/32/1/N59 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2012 Mar;32(1):N59-63. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/32/1/N59.

With the increasing range of therapeutic options, the treatment context is important when defining refractory CLL. Refractory CLL has been defined as no response or response lasting </= 6 months from last therapy. This subgroup has a very poor outcome, and many trials use this group as an entry point for early drug development. With the intensification of first-line regimens, the proportion of patients with refractory CLL using these criteria decreases. This has immediate consequences for recruitment of patients into trials as well as salvage strategies. Conversely, patients who are not refractory according to the traditional definition but who have suboptimal or short response to intense therapy also have a very poor outcome. In this Perspective, we discuss recent results that may lead to a reassessment of risk categories in CLL focusing on fit patients who are eligible for all treatment options. We cover aspects of the history and biologic basis for refractory CLL and will focus on how emerging data on treatment failure from large trials using chemoimmunotherapy may help to define risk groups in CLL.",,"['Zenz, Thorsten', 'Gribben, John G', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Zenz T', 'Gribben JG', 'Hallek M', 'Dohner H', 'Keating MJ', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 460, Heidelberg, Germany. thorsten.zenz@nct-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120306,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forecasting', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/drug therapy/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rituximab', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Treatment Failure', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2012/03/08 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/03/08 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47906-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-312421 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 3;119(18):4101-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-312421.

Solid cancer: the recent report on solid cancer incidence found that at age 70 years following exposure at age 30 years, solid cancer rates increase by about 35% Gy(-1) for men and 58% Gy(-1) for women. Age-at-exposure is an important risk modifier. In the case of lung cancer, cigarette smoking has been found to be an important risk modifier. Radiation has similar effects on first-primary and second-primary cancer risks. Finally, radiation-associated increases in cancer rates appear to persist throughout life. Leukaemia: the recent report on leukaemia mortality suggests that radiation effects on leukaemia mortality persisted for more than 50 years. Moreover, significant dose-response for myelodysplastic syndrome was observed in Nagasaki LSS members even 40-60 years after radiation exposure.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Lymphoma cell lines and a large series of normal and neoplastic samples were investigated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The antibody detected nuclear positivity for the protein, with the exception of a proportion of classical Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs), peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) and solid tumours that showed granular cytoplasmic staining. In normal lympho-haematopoietic tissues, LMO2 was expressed at different intensities by CD34(+) blasts, haematopoietic precursors, germinal centre (GC), mantle and splenic marginal zone B cells. While reactive with only scattered elements in the thymus and nine of 237 PTCLs, the antibody stained 31 of 39 T-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemias (T-ALLs) and the T-ALL-derived human leukaemic cell line, CCRF-CEM. LMO2 was found in 88% of B-acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemias (B-ALLs), 5% chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLLs) and 14%, 57% and 41% of mantle, follicular and Burkitt lymphomas, respectively. In the setting of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), LMO2-positivity was related strongly to a GC phenotype. LMO2 was found in 83% primary mediastinal large B cell lymphomas (PMBLs) and 100% nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas (NLPHLs), whereas only 10% of classical HLs were stained. Acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias were usually positive.

CICs comprise a subset of hierarchically organized, rare cancer cells with the ability to initiate cancer in xenografts in genetically modified murine models. CICs are thought to be responsible for tumor onset, self-renewal/maintenance, mutation accumulation and metastasis. CICs may lay dormant after various cancer therapies which eliminate the more rapidly proliferating bulk cancer (BC) mass. However, CICs may remerge after therapy is discontinued as they may represent cells which were either intrinsically resistant to the original therapeutic approach or they have acquired mutations which confer resistance to the primary therapy. In experimental mouse tumor transplant models, CICs have the ability to transfer the tumor to immunocompromised mice very efficiently while the BCs are not able to do so as effectively. Often CICs display increased expression of proteins involved in drug resistance and hence they are intrinsically resistant to many chemotherapeutic approaches. Furthermore, the CICs may be in a suspended state of proliferation and not sensitive to common chemotherapeutic and radiological approaches often employed to eliminate the rapidly proliferating BCs. Promising therapeutic approaches include the targeting of certain signal transduction pathways (e.g., RAC, WNT, PI3K, PML) with small molecule inhibitors or targeting specific cell-surface molecules (e.g., CD44), with effective cytotoxic antibodies. The existence of CICs could explain the high frequency of relapse and resistance to many currently used cancer therapies. New approaches should be developed to effectively target the CIC which could vastly improve cancer therapies and outcomes.

It negatively regulates NF-kappaB, and has been identified as a tumour suppressor. Several studies have described A20 inactivation by deletion of the A20 locus at 6q23, inactivating mutations, and/or methylation of the A20 promoter in various lymphoma entities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated a monoclonal antibody against the C-terminus of A20 (Ber-A20) and investigated full-length A20 expression of normal lymphoid tissue and lymphomas for the first time. We identified loss of A20 expression in tumour cells of 24% of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, 27% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 20% of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 19% of follicular lymphoma, 13% of mantle cell lymphoma and 8% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma cases by immunohistology. Loss of A20 expression rarely occurred in T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in agreement with cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Among 21 cases of ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphomas with known A20 mutation status, we detected complete absence of A20 expression, whereas cases with wild-type A20 were weakly A20-positive.

The purpose of this prospective, unicentric study were to assess the socio-demographic, clinic and laboratory characteristics of the children treated for lymphoblastic leukemia in our pediatric oncology unit in Gabriel Toure Teaching Hospital in Bamako, Mali. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study includes all children between 1 and 15 years old treated for cytologically documented acute lymphoblastic leukemia from January 1, 2007 to September 30, 2009. RESULTS: A total of 12 cases including 8 boys and 4 girls (sex ration, 2) were treated during the study period. Mean age was 92 months. Age was less than 4 years old in 2 cases. 5 (41,7%) were between 5 and 9 years in 5 (41.7%) and between 10 to 15 years in five. At the time of presentation, 9 patients (75%) were in a cachectic state; 10 had lymphadenopathies, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly; and 2 had neurological involvement. The delay for definitive diagnosis was 5 months in 4 cases (33,3 %) and less than 5 months in the remaining cases. Initial white blood cell count was more than 50 000/mm3 in 10 cases and less less than 50 000/mm3 in 2 cases. All patients were treated using the LAL GFAOP protocol including LAL1 in 6 cases, LAL2 in 5 and LAL3 in 1. Treatment complications were included 6 undocumented infections in 6 cases, hemorrhage in 2 and severe anemia in 4. Four patients died. At 5 years follow-up, overall survival rate was 66,7%.

Activated Notch receptors also efficiently induce T cell leukemogenesis in mouse models. Interestingly, gain-of-function mutations or cryptic transcription initiation of the Notch1 gene have been frequently found in both human and mouse T-ALL. However, the correlations between these alterations and overall Notch activities or leukemogenesis have not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, we made use of our collection of T cell lymphomas developed in transgenic mice expressing Id1, which like TAL1, inhibits E protein function. By comparing expression levels of Notch target genes in Id1-expressing tumors to those in tumors induced by a constitutively active form of Notch1, N1C, we were able to assess the overall activities of Notch pathways and conclude that the majority of Id1-expressing tumors had elevated Notch function to a varying degree. However, 26% of the Id1-expressing tumors had no evidence of enhanced Notch activation, but that did not delay the onset of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we examined the genetic or epigenetic alterations thought to contribute to ligand-independent activation or protein stabilization of Notch1 and found that some of the Id1-expressing tumors acquired these changes, but they are not uniformly associated with elevated Notch activities in Id1 tumor samples. In contrast, N1C-expressing tumors do not harbor any PEST domain mutations nor exhibit intragenic transcription initiation. Taken together, it appears that Notch activation provides Id1-expressing tumor cells with selective advantages in growth and survival. However, this may not be absolutely essential for lymphomagenesis in Id1 transgenic mice and additional factors could also cooperate with Id1 to induce T cell lymphoma. Therefore, a broad approach is necessary in designing T-ALL therapy.",,"['Wang, Hong-Cheng', 'Peng, Vincent', 'Zhao, Ying', 'Sun, Xiao-Hong']","['Wang HC', 'Peng V', 'Zhao Y', 'Sun XH']","['Immunobiology and Cancer Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120229,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dimerization', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Transgenes']",2012/03/07 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/03/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0032944 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20310 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e32944. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032944.

However, MYC is also a powerful inducer of apoptosis, which is one of the major failsafe programs to prevent cancer development. To clarify the relative importance of the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) versus the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis in MYC-driven AML, we coexpressed MYC together with anti-apoptotic proteins of relevance for AML; BCL-X(L)/BCL-2 (inhibiting the intrinsic pathway) or FLIP(L) (inhibiting the extrinsic pathway), in hematopoietic stems cells (HSCs). Transplantation of HSCs expressing MYC into syngeneic recipient mice resulted in development of AML and T-cell lymphomas within 7-9 weeks as expected. Importantly, coexpression of MYC together with BCL-X(L)/BCL-2 resulted in strongly accelerated kinetics and favored tumor development towards aggressive AML. In contrast, coexpression of MYC and FLIP(L) did neither accelerate tumorigenesis nor change the ratio of AML versus T-cell lymphoma. However, a change in distribution of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) versus mature CD4(+) T-cell lymphoma was observed in MYC/FLIP(L) mice, possibly as a result of increased survival of the CD4+ population, but this did not significantly affect the outcome of the disease. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that BCL-X(L) and BCL-2 but not FLIP(L) acts in synergy with MYC to drive AML development.",,"['Hogstrand, Kari', 'Hejll, Eduar', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Rozell, Bjorn', 'Larsson, Lars-Gunnar', 'Grandien, Alf']","['Hogstrand K', 'Hejll E', 'Sander B', 'Rozell B', 'Larsson LG', 'Grandien A']","['Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120229,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Cflar protein, mouse)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2012/03/07 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/03/07 06:00'],"['2011/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031366 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-22568 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31366. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031366.

Although treatment guidelines were changed to indicate that some women could forego RT, the impact of the C9343 results on clinical practice is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare data set to assess the use of adjuvant RT in a sample of women >/= 70 years old diagnosed with stage I breast cancer from 2001 to 2007 who fulfilled the C9343 inclusion criteria. We used log-binomial regression to estimate the relation between publication of C9343 and use of RT in the full sample and across strata of patient and health system characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 12,925 Medicare beneficiaries in our sample (mean age, 77.7 years), 76.5% received RT. Approximately 79% of women received RT before study publication compared with 75% after (adjusted relative risk of receiving RT postpublication v prepublication: 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98). Although use of RT was lower after the trial within all strata of age and life expectancy, the magnitude of this decrease did not differ significantly by strata. For instance, among patients with life expectancy less than 5 years, RT use decreased by 3.7%, from 44.4% prepublication to 40.7% postpublication. Among patients with life expectancy >/= 10 years, RT use decreased by 3.0%, from 92.0% to 89.0%.

The possible confounding biases from drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco were evaluated by examining the association of cumulative radiation dose with the mortality of cancers related to drinking or smoking. For leukaemia (80 deaths), the estimate of ERR/Sv was - 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) = - 6.12, 8.57). For all cancers excluding leukaemia (2636 deaths), while the ERR/Sv was estimated to be 1.26 (95%CI = - 0.27, 3.00), confounding by alcohol consumption was suspected since the ERR/Sv estimate of alcohol-related cancers was 4.64 (95%CI = 1.13, 8.91) and the ERR/Sv estimate of all cancers excluding leukaemia and alcohol-related cancers was 0.20 (95%CI = - 1.42, 2.09). In conclusion, confounding by important lifestyle factors related to cancer risk may have a substantial effect on risk estimates, especially when conducting studies of low cumulative dose and, accordingly, low statistical power.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role and value of patient advocates from the perspective of Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) advocates and investigators. METHODS: An online survey was sent to current and past (within 5 years) patient advocates and investigators. RESULTS.: Response rates were 72.7% (16 of 22) for advocates and 56.4% (102 of 181) for investigators. Patient advocates were more likely than investigators to report the following: the clinical trial process benefited from advocate involvement on committees (100% of advocates vs 72.1% of investigators; P < .05), advocates contribute to protocol development (92.8% vs 33.8%, respectively; P < .001), the cultural appropriateness of protocols (21.4% vs 10.4%, respectively; P < .05), advocates assist with patient accrual (78.6% vs 23.4%, respectively; P < .001), and advocates add value to concept development and protocol review (100% vs 63.2%, respectively; P < .001). Over half of advocates and investigators reported gaps in patient advocate knowledge and suggested that additional clinical trials training was needed. To improve clinical trials, advocates suggested their earlier involvement in protocol development and increased support from investigators. CALGB investigators recommended improving patient advocate selection and communication skills training: CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patient advocates and investigators perceived benefits from advocate involvement in the clinical trials process; patient advocates placed more value on their role than investigators. The current results indicated that strategies to improve advocacy training and advocate-investigator communication may further enhance the role of patient advocates, and future studies that clarify the role of advocates in the prioritization and development of protocol, consent, and education materials, and on patient accrual, are warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.'],"['Katz, Mira L', 'Archer, Laura E', 'Peppercorn, Jeffrey M', 'Kereakoglow, Sandra', 'Collyar, Deborah E', 'Burstein, Harold J', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Partridge, Ann H']","['Katz ML', 'Archer LE', 'Peppercorn JM', 'Kereakoglow S', 'Collyar DE', 'Burstein HJ', 'Schilsky RL', 'Partridge AH']","['Division of Health Behavior and Health Promotion, College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. mira.katz@osumc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120305,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/standards/*trends', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/therapy', '*Patient Advocacy/standards/trends', 'Research Design/standards/*trends', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",2012/03/07 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/03/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27485 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Oct 1;118(19):4801-5. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27485.

To maintain excellent outcomes while avoiding toxicity, the Children's Oncology Group (COG) conducted the phase 3 trial COG A2971, the first trial solely designed to provide uniform treatment of myeloid leukemia in North American children with DS. A2971 eliminated 2 induction drugs and 3 months of maintenance therapy from the standard-timing regimen of dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, etoposide, and rubidomycin/daunomycin (DCTER) used in the previous study (Children's Cancer Group [CCG] 2891). METHODS: COG A2971 was a multi-institutional, nonrandomized, clinical trial that enrolled 132 patients who had DS with either acute myeloid leukemia (n = 91) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 41). RESULTS: The median follow-up was 4.8 years (range, 0.8-8.6 years), the median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years (range, 0.3-13.6 years), and the median white blood cell count was 6200/muL (range, 900-164,900/muL). The remission rate (92.7% +/- 6%) was similar to that reported in the CCG 2891 study (91.3% +/- 5%; P = .679). The 5-year event free survival (EFS) rate was 79% +/- 7% (vs 77% +/- 7% in CCG 2891; P = .589), the disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 89% +/- 6% (vs 85% +/- 6% in CCG 2891; P = .337), and the overall survival rate was 84% +/- 6% (vs 79% +/- 7% in CCG 2891; P = .302). Induction day-14 bone marrow response trended toward a more favorable outcome (EFS: P = .12). Age >4 years was an adverse risk factor (5-year EFS rate: 33% +/- 38% for children aged >4 years [median, 8.5 years; n = 6] vs 81% +/- 7% for children ages 0-4 years [median, 1.7 years; n = 126]; P = .001).

We investigated S6K1, a protein kinase that drives glycolysis in leukemia cells, as a target for counteracting glucose-dependent survival induced by BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL potently activated S6K1-dependent signaling and glycolysis. Although S6K1 knockdown or rapamycin treatment suppressed glycolysis in BCR-ABL-transformed cells, these treatments did not induce cell death. Instead, loss of S6K1 triggered compensatory activation of fatty-acid oxidation, a metabolic program that can support glucose-independent cell survival. Fatty-acid oxidation in response to S6K1 inactivation required the expression of the fatty-acid transporter carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1c, which was recently linked to rapamycin resistance in cancer. Finally, addition of an inhibitor of fatty-acid oxidation significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in response to S6K1 inactivation. These data indicate that S6K1 dictates the metabolic requirements mediating BCR-ABL survival and provide a rationale for combining targeted inhibitors of signal transduction, with strategies to interrupt oncogene-induced metabolism.",,"['Barger, J F', 'Gallo, C A', 'Tandon, P', 'Liu, H', 'Sullivan, A', 'Grimes, H L', 'Plas, D R']","['Barger JF', 'Gallo CA', 'Tandon P', 'Liu H', 'Sullivan A', 'Grimes HL', 'Plas DR']","['Department of Cancer and Cell Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45208-0521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120305,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Fatty Acid Transport Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', 'EC 2.3.1.21 (Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 1)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Fatty Acid Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glucose/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology']",2012/03/07 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/03/07 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201270 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Jan 24;32(4):453-61. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.70.

It has been shown to have various other targets in cells such as JNK, NFkappaB, thioredoxin reductase, and MAPK pathways. Most of its effects in cells have been through arsenic's ability to bind to thiol groups in cysteine residues. Recent evidence has shown that arsenic can inhibit the Hedgehog pathway by inhibiting GLI proteins. The proposed mechanism of action is through direct binding. Potential binding sites include the critical cysteine residues in GLI zinc finger domains.

The mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow of leukemia children by Ficoll-Hypaque. The experiment was divided into six groups: blank control group (A), crocin 1.25 mg/ml group (B), cytokines (rhGM-CSF 75 ng/ml+rhIL-4 75 ng/ml+rhTNF-alpha 50 ng/ml) group (C), cytokines+crocin 0.3125, 1.25 or 5.0 mg/ml groups (D, E, F). The numbers of DC were counted and the phenotypes of DC were determined by flow cytometry on the ninth day of culture. The DC of different groups were mixed with T cells just separated from peripheral blood of another children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and cultured with rhIL-2 200 U/ml for 5 d. The function of DC was detected by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The results indicated that the test groups and control group all obtained a certain amount of typical DC, but the DC numbers in test groups were all higher than those in control group (P < 0.01). Cultured for 9 days, the rates of CD1a(+), CD83(+), and HLA-DR(+) in group C, D, E, F were higher than group A (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between A and B groups (P > 0.05). MLR showed that with the increasing of DC, the stimulation index of T cells in group A and B was not rising (P > 0.05); the stimulated index of T cells in group C and E was significantly rising, there was statistically significant difference between them (P < 0.01). When the number of stimulated cells was the same, the stimulation index of T cell in group E was the highest (P < 0.01). It is concluded that the capability of DC proliferation promoted by crocin alone is lower than that of its combination with rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4 and rhTNF-alpha, but the crocin can synergically promote the maturity of DC cooperating with rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4 and rhTNF-alpha.

To explore whether there were other MLL gene mutations at M4 and M5, in this study all of the MLL exons were sequenced at cDNA level. 25 patients with de novo AML-M4 or M5 with normal karyotypes excluding M4eo and MLL fusion gene or MLL-PTD were selected, the amplification and direct sequencing analysis of full length MLL gene exons were carried out, then the mutations found were verified at genomic DNA level. Furthermore, the point mutations were tested in normal samples and a larger group of AML patients using the platform of Mass Array. The results showed that high-frequency deletion/insertion and point mutations in RD, PHD, TAD and SET domains of MLL were found, while these alterations in normal samples and other subtypes of AML samples were also verified, and without significant difference (P > 0.05). It is concluded that a variety of deletions/insertions in MLL mRNA and point mutations are respectively alternative splicing of MLL gene at transcriptional level and single nucleotide polymorphism. These alternations together constituted genetic polymorphisms of MLL.

The results showed that (1) the expression of HtrA2 gene in newly diagnosed AML was lower than that of the normal controls (P < 0.01), while expression of WT1 gene in newly diagnosed AML was higher than that of the normal controls (P < 0.01), the expression levels of HtrA2 and WT1 genes both did not correlate with age, sex and WBC counts of patients. There were no significant difference of HtrA2 gene expression between different NCCN prognosis group, while WT1 gene expression in better-risk group was significantly lower than that in intermediate-risk group (P = 0.003). The HtrA2 expression level rose after treatment in both CR group and non-CR group (P < 0.05), while WT1 expression level significantly decreased after treatment only in CR group (P < 0.01). Negative correlation between HtrA2 and WT1 expression was also observed (r = -0.249, P = 0.011).

A constitutively activated, mutated form of FLT3, is expressed in approximately 30% of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and about 6% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. Since mutant FLT3 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target, there are several FLT3 inhibitors currently undergoing evaluation in different phases of clinical trials. However, although many aspects of the intracellular signaling mediated by oncogenic FLT3 have been revealed, what is the best strategy to inhibit FLT3 and how FLT3 inhibitors should be developed for AML treatment is poorly defined. Despite promising in vitro studies, where most FLT3 inhibitors show potent efficacy at nanomolar concentrations, clinical responses in AML patients are moderate and temporary. Furthermore, under prolonged therapy, FLT3 mutation-positive leukemic cells rapidly develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors when used as monotherapy. Considering that there is no uniform mechanism of resistance triggered by FLT3 inhibitors, it will be necessary to develop new agents that target FLT3, and that can be used consecutively or in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapeutics. On the other hand, given that overexpression of FLT3 ligand (FL), occurring after myelosuppressive therapy, reduces the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors, targeting both FL and FLT3 kinase, might be more effective approach in AML treatment. Here, we summarize up-to-date studies on FLT3 structure, its mutation status and role in malignant signal trafficking.

In this study, we sought to analyse gene expression profiles of CMML in order to characterize new molecular outcome predictors. A learning set of 32 untreated CMML patients at diagnosis was available for TaqMan low-density array gene expression analysis. From 93 selected genes related to cancer and cell cycle, we built a five-gene prognostic index after multiplicity correction. Using this index, we characterized two categories of patients with distinct overall survival (94% vs. 19% for good and poor overall survival, respectively; P = 0.007) and we successfully validated its strength on an independent cohort of 21 CMML patients with Affymetrix gene expression data.

As a first step to use spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to enable genetic modification, we here describe effective long-term culture conditions for propagating zebrafish SSCs and for the production of offspring from these cultured SSCs after their differentiation into sperm in transplanted testicular cell aggregates. Dissociated testicular cells were cultured in specific medium with some modified supplements, including several mammalian growth factors. The spermatogonia actively proliferated and retained the expression of exogenous green fluorescent protein under the control of vas and sox17 promoters and also of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf), a marker of undifferentiated spermatogonia, after 1 month in culture. This is a longer period than the entire natural spermatogenic cycle (from SSCs to sperm). The use of subcutaneously grafted aggregates of these cultured spermatogonia and freshly dissociated testicular cells showed that these SSCs could undergo self-renewal and differentiation into sperm. Artificial insemination of these grafted aggregates successfully produced offspring. This culture method will facilitate the identification of new factors for the maintenance of SSCs and enable the future enrichment of genetically modified SSCs that will produce offspring in zebrafish.","['(c) 2012 The Authors.

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying antigen-mediated mast cell degranulation have been studied intensively, little is known about the transcriptional control of this process. Here, we show that the hematopoietic transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 are involved in mast cell degranulation through the control of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) expression. Knockdown of GATA1 and/or GATA2 by specific siRNA significantly reduced antigen-induced degranulation and Ca(2+) mobilization in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. RT-PCR analyses showed that PLC-gamma1 expression was significantly decreased by this GATA factor repression. Other GATA factor targets, such as the previously reported alpha and beta subunits of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI), were unaffected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that GATA factors directly activate PLC-gamma1 gene transcription through a conserved GATA-binding motif that resides in the 5'-upstream sequence. Furthermore, we show evidence that the PLC-gamma1 expression is regulated by GATA2 in mast cells derived from mouse bone marrow. These data indicate that PLC-gamma1 is a target gene of GATA factors in mast cells and provide evidence that GATA1 and GATA2 control antigen-mediated mast cell degranulation by regulating the expression of PLC-gamma1.","['(c) 2012 The Authors.

We hypothesized that improved detection of chromosomal abnormalities with new karyotyping tools may better predict response to LEN. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have studied clinical, molecular and cytogenetic features of 42 patients with MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) without del[5q] by metaphase cytogenetics (MC) who underwent therapy with LEN. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping marginally increased the diagnostic yield over MC, detecting 2/42 (4.8%) additional cases with del[5q], one of whom were responded to LEN. Responses were more often observed in patients with a normal karyotype by MC (60% vs abnormal MC; 17%, p = .08) and those with gain of chromosome 8 material by either of all 3 karyotyping methods (83% vs all other chromosomal abnormalities; 44% p = .11). However, 5 out of those 6 patients received combined LEN/AZA therapy and it may also suggest those with gain of chromosome 8 material respond well to AZA. The addition of FISH or SNP-A did not improve the predictive value of normal cytogenetics by MC. Mutational analysis of TET2, UTX, CBL, EZH2, ASXL1, TP53, RAS, IDH1/2, and DNMT-3A was performed on 21 of 41 patients, and revealed 13 mutations in 11 patients, but did not show any molecular markers of responsiveness to LEN.

An interesting enzyme implicated in this disease is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a specialized DNA polymerase involved in V(D)J recombination. TdT is an excellent biomarker for ALL as it is overexpressed in ~90% of ALL patients, and these higher levels correlate with a poor prognosis. These collective features make TdT an attractive target to design new selective anti-cancer agents against ALL. In this report, we evaluate the anti-leukemia activities of two non-natural nucleotides designated 5-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphate (5-NITP) and 3-ethynyl-5-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphate (3-Eth-5-NITP). Using purified TdT, we demonstrate that both non-natural nucleotides are efficiently utilized as TdT substrates. However, 3-Eth-5-NITP is poorly elongated, and this observation validates its activity as a chain-terminator for blunt-end DNA synthesis. Cell-based experiments validate that the corresponding non-natural nucleoside produces robust cytostatic and cytotoxic effects against leukemia cells that overexpress TdT. The strategic placement of the ethynyl moiety allows the incorporated nucleoside triphosphate to be selectively tagged with an azide-containing fluorophore via ""click"" chemistry. This reaction allows the extent of nucleotide incorporation to be quantified such that the anti-cancer effects of the corresponding non-natural nucleoside can be self-assessed. The applications of this novel nucleoside are discussed, focusing on its use as a ""theranostic"" agent that can improve the accuracy of dosing regimens and accelerate clinical decisions regarding therapeutic intervention.",,"['Motea, Edward A', 'Lee, Irene', 'Berdis, Anthony J']","['Motea EA', 'Lee I', 'Berdis AJ']","['Departments of Chemistry , Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120313,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleosides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*enzymology']",2012/03/07 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/03/07 06:00'],"['2012/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb300038f [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2012 Jun 15;7(6):988-98. doi: 10.1021/cb300038f.

We hypothesized that inhibition of OCTN2 by anticancer drugs can influence carnitine resorption. OCTN2-mediated transport inhibition by anticancer drugs was assessed using cells transfected with human OCTN2 (hOCTN2) or mouse Octn2 (mOctn2). Excretion of carnitine and acetylcarnitine was measured in urine collected from mice and pediatric patients with cancer before and after administration of etoposide. Five of 27 tested drugs (50-100 mumol/L) inhibited hOCTN2-mediated carnitine uptake by 42% to 85% (P < 0.001). Of these inhibitors, etoposide was itself a transported substrate of hOCTN2 and mOctn2. Etoposide uptake by hOCTN2 was reversed in the presence of excess carnitine. This competitive inhibitory mechanism was confirmed in an in silico molecular docking analysis.

Etoposide was also associated with a significant urinary loss of carnitine in mice (~1.5-fold) and in patients with cancer (~2.4-fold).

Natural compounds are among the current strategies aimed at targeting c-Myc, but their modes of action still need to be characterized. To explore the mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of a natural diterpenoid, oridonin, we conducted miRNA expression profiling and statistical analyses that strongly suggested that c-Myc was a potential molecular target of oridonin. Furthermore, experimental data showed that oridonin significantly reduced c-Myc protein levels in vitro and in vivo and that this reduction was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Fbw7, a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and an E3 ubiquitin ligase of c-Myc, was upregulated rapidly in K562 cells and other leukemia and lymphoma cells, resulting in the rapid turnover of c-Myc. In cell lines harboring mutations in the WD domain of Fbw7, the degradation of c-Myc induced by oridonin was attenuated during short-term treatment. GSK-3, an Fbw7 priming kinase, was also activated by oridonin, along with an increase in T58-phosphorylated c-Myc. Furthermore, the knockdown of Fbw7 or the forced expression of stable c-Myc resulted in reduced sensitization to oridonin-induced apoptosis. Our observations help to clarify the anticancer mechanisms of oridonin and shed light on the application of this natural compound as an Fbw7-c-Myc pathway targeting agent in cancer treatment.",['(c)2012 AACR'],"['Huang, Hui-Lin', 'Weng, Heng-You', 'Wang, Lu-Qin', 'Yu, Chun-Hong', 'Huang, Qiao-Juan', 'Zhao, Pan-Pan', 'Wen, Jun-Zhi', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Qu, Liang-Hu']","['Huang HL', 'Weng HY', 'Wang LQ', 'Yu CH', 'Huang QJ', 'Zhao PP', 'Wen JZ', 'Zhou H', 'Qu LH']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120302,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2012/03/06 06:00,2013/02/19 06:00,['2012/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0066 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0066 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 May;11(5):1155-65. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0066.

In this study, we investigated the effects of IFNs on MCC cell lines, especially on MCV-positive (MCV(+)) lines. Type I IFNs (i.e., Multiferon, a mix of different IFN-alpha subtypes, and IFN-beta) strongly inhibited the cellular viability. Cell-cycle analysis showed increased sub-G fractions for these cells upon IFN treatment indicating apoptotic cell death; these effects were less pronounced for IFN-gamma. Notably, this inhibitory effect of type I IFNs on MCV(+) MCC cell lines was associated with a reduced expression of the MCV LTA as well as an increased expression of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, which is known to interfere with the function of the LTA. In addition, the intratumoral application of Multiferon resulted in a regression of MCV(+) but not MCV(-) MCCs in vivo.

Mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 were found in 24 (12.4%), 14 (7.3%), 6 (3.1%), and 28 (14.5%) patients, respectively, corresponding to a total of 67 of 193 MDS patients (34.7%). SRSF2 mutations were associated with RUNX1 (P < .001) and IDH1 (P = .013) mutations, whereas U2AF1 mutations were associated with ASXL1 (P = .005) and DNMT3A (P = .004) mutations. In univariate analysis, mutated SRSF2 predicted shorter overall survival and more frequent acute myeloid leukemia progression compared with wild-type SRSF2, whereas mutated U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 had no impact on patient outcome. In multivariate analysis, SRSF2 remained an independent poor risk marker for overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.13; P = .017) and acute myeloid leukemia progression (hazard ratio = 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-6.12; P = .008).

These fields potentially elicit small effects that have been proposed to have consequences, either positive or negative, for biological systems. To reveal potentially weak but biologically relevant effects, we chose to extensively examine exposure of immune cells to two different signals, namely a complex multiple waveform field, and a 50 Hz sine wave. These immune cells are highly responsive and, in vivo, modulation of cytokine expression responses can result in systemic health effects. Using time course experiments, we determined kinetics of cytokine and other inflammation-related genes in a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, and primary monocytes and macrophages. Moreover, cytokine protein levels in THP-1 monocytes were determined. Exposure to either of the two signals did not result in a significant effect on gene and protein expression in the studied immune cells. Also, additional experiments using non-immune cells showed no effects of the signals on cytokine gene expression. We therefore conclude that these LF EMF exposure conditions are not expected to significantly modulate innate immune signaling.","['(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bouwens, Mark', 'de Kleijn, Stan', 'Ferwerda, Gerben', 'Cuppen, Jan J', 'Savelkoul, Huub F J', 'Kemenade, B M Lidy Verburg-van']","['Bouwens M', 'de Kleijn S', 'Ferwerda G', 'Cuppen JJ', 'Savelkoul HF', 'Kemenade BM']","['Cell Biology and Immunology Group, Wageningen University, The Netherlands.

However, studies focused on the in vivo regulation of testicular stem cells have been hampered because the exact anatomical location of these cells is unknown. Moreover, no specialized stem cell niche substructure has been identified in the mammalian testis thus far. It has also been unclear whether the adult mammalian testis houses pluripotent stem cells or whether pluripotency can be induced only in vitro. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of a Nanog-positive spermatogonial stem cell subpopulation located in stage XII of the mouse seminiferous epithelial cycle. The efficiency of the cells from seminiferous tubules with respect to prolonged pluripotent gene expression was correlated directly with stage-specific expression levels of Nanog and Oct4, demonstrating the previously unknown stage-specific regulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG). Testicular Nanog expression marked a radioresistant spermatogonial subpopulation, supporting its stem cell nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p21 acts as an upstream regulator of Nanog in SPG and mouse ESCs, and our results demonstrate that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger is a specific marker of progenitor SPG. Additionally, we describe a novel method to cultivate Nanog-positive SPG in vitro.

It is well known that CML cells are genetically unstable. However, the mechanisms by which these cells acquire genetic alterations are poorly understood. Imatinib mesylate is the standard therapy for newly diagnosed CML patients. Imatinib mesylate targets the oncogenic kinase activity of BCR-ABL. OBJECTIVE: To study the gene expression profile of bone marrow hematopoietic cells in the same patients with CML before and 1 month after imatinib therapy. METHODS: Samples from patients with CML were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Arrays. RESULTS: A total of 594 differentially expressed genes, most of which (393 genes) were downregulated, as a result of imatinib therapy were observed. CONCLUSION: The blockade of oncoprotein Bcr-Abl by imatinib could cause a decrease in the expression of key DNA repair genes and substantially modify the expression profile of the bone marrow cells in the first days of therapy.",,"['Benito, Rocio', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Abaigar, Maria', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Delgado, Manuel', 'Robledo, Cristina', 'Garcia, Juan L', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Canizo, M Consuelo', 'Rivas, Jesus Maria Hernandez']","['Benito R', 'Lumbreras E', 'Abaigar M', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Delgado M', 'Robledo C', 'Garcia JL', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Canizo MC', 'Rivas JM']","['Institute of Biomedicine of Salamanca, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer, Center of Cancer Research, University of Salamanca-CSIC, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2012/03/06 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2012/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0b013e328351f3e9 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2012 May;22(5):381-8. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0b013e328351f3e9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematoxylin and eosin, reticulin and trichrome stains, and immunohistochemical stains for myeloperoxidase, glycophorin-C, CD42b, CD34, CD117, CD8, nerve growth factor receptor and smooth muscle actin were evaluated. Clinical information was correlated with the morphological findings. Three distinct histological patterns of EMHP were recognized: diffuse (12), nodular (5), and mixed-nodular and diffuse (7). The preponderant lineage was granulocytic in diffuse, trilineage in nodular and erythroid in mixed EMHP. Erythropoiesis was largely intravascular, granulopoiesis was within the splenic cords and megakaryopoiesis was observed in both locations. The stromal changes paralleled the histological pattern with preservation of the splenic stromal and vascular architecture in the diffuse areas as opposed to areas of nodular EMHP. The morphological features of the splenic EMHP did not correlate with specific subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms. The mean duration of follow-up from initial diagnosis was 80 months. A total of 15 of the 24 patients died of disease: 8 of 12 (67%) with diffuse, 2 of 5 (40%) with nodular and 5 of 7 (71%) with mixed growth patterns. The mean duration from diagnosis to splenectomy was shorter in patients with diffuse (83 months) as compared with those with nodular EMHP (127 months). Our study demonstrates that splenic extramedullary hematopoietic proliferation in Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms shows distinct histological patterns that do not correlate with disease subtypes, but appear to suggest a trend between the histological patterns and clinical behavior. These results suggest a different biology of the disease in the nodular and diffuse extramedullary hematopoietic proliferation groups.",,"['Prakash, Sonam', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Barouk, Sharon', 'Wang, Y Lynn', 'Knowles, Daniel M', 'Orazi, Attilio']","['Prakash S', 'Hoffman R', 'Barouk S', 'Wang YL', 'Knowles DM', 'Orazi A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120302,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'New York City', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology/surgery', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology/surgery', 'Spleen/*pathology/surgery', 'Splenectomy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/03/06 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/03/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol201233 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2012.33 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2012 Jun;25(6):815-27. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2012.33.

In in-vitro experiments with myeloid cell lines, RKIP overexpression inhibited cellular proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Analysis of two cohorts with 103 and 285 AML patients, respectively, established a correlation of decreased RKIP expression with monocytic phenotypes. RKIP loss was associated with RAS mutations and in transformation assays, RKIP decreased the oncogenic potential of mutant RAS. Loss of RKIP further related to a significantly longer relapse-free survival and overall survival in uni- and multivariate analyses. Our data show that RKIP is frequently lost in AML and correlates with monocytic phenotypes and mutations in RAS. RKIP inhibits proliferation and transformation of myeloid cells and decreases transformation induced by mutant RAS.

Deletions and copy neutral LOH in 3 and 2 of the 16 cases directed us to the histone-modifying CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) gene, whose functional impairment is implicated in drug resistance. We therefore screened all samples for mutations in this gene and discovered 9 acquired sequence mutations in 7/16 cases, leading to an overall frequency of somatic CREBBP aberrations in HD ALL relapse cases of 63% that is considerably higher than that of the reported, mainly non-HD ALL (18.3%).

The usage of high-dose methotrexate was limited to patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One of the major side effects of high-dose methotrexate is nephropathy. The aim of present study was to determine the renal side effects of high-dose methotrexate in patients with malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a study of 102 patients with osteosarcoma (n = 72), Ewing sarcoma (n = 15), and lymphoma (n = 15), treated with high-dose methotrexate, clinical and laboratory data including kidney function tests were recorded at baseline and during follow-up visits. The mean duration of follow-up was 6 months. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 19.5 years (range, 5 to 80 years). The total courses of methotrexate therapy were 273 (median, 2.67 per patient). The mean creatinine level was 0.82 mg/dL. Of the 102 patients, 3 (2.9%) developed acute kidney injury with an at risk phase. Another patient (1.0%) developed acute kidney injury and its phase was injury according to the RIFLE criteria. None of the cases were failed and acute kidney injury was alleviated in all of the affected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed a low prevalence of acute kidney injury with high-dose methotrexate therapy. In addition, these toxicities were limited to the first and second phases of the RIFLE classification, all of which resolved spontaneously.",,"['Mashhadi, Mohammad Ali', 'Kaykhaei, Mahmoud Ali', 'Sanadgol, Houshang']","['Mashhadi MA', 'Kaykhaei MA', 'Sanadgol H']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. dralimashhadi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Kidney Dis,Iranian journal of kidney diseases,101316967,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/06 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2012/03/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['643/384 [pii]'],ppublish,Iran J Kidney Dis. 2012 Mar;6(2):105-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials of AYA patients with ALL given induction chemotherapy with either pediatric-inspired regimens or conventional-adult chemotherapy was conducted. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and pooled. Our search yielded 11 trials, including 2,489 patients. AYA patients given pediatric-inspired regimens had a statistically significant lower all cause mortality rate at 3 years (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.51-0.67). Complete remission rate after induction chemotherapy and event free survival were superior in the pediatric-inspired regimens arm (RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.10 and RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.39-1.99, respectively).

The mechanism by which the anti-apoptotic activity of Aven is regulated remains poorly understood. Here we shed light on this issue by demonstrating that proteolytic removal of an inhibitory N-terminal Aven domain is necessary to activate the anti-apoptotic potential of the molecule.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying imatinib-induced C-terminal phosphorylation of H2AX in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in vitro. METHODS: BCR-ABL-positive K562 cells were used. Microscopy, Western blotting and flow cytometry were used to study the signaling pathways that regulate imatinib-induced H2AX phosphorylation and the apoptotic mechanisms. RESULTS: Treatment of K562 cells with imatinib (1-8 mumol/L) induced phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139 and Tyr142 in time- and dose-dependent manners. In contrast, imatinib at the same concentrations did not affect H2AX acetylation at Lys 5, and the acetylated H2AX maintained a higher level in the cells. Meanwhile, imatinib (1-8 mumol/L) activated caspase-3 and its downstream mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), and induced apoptosis of K562 cells.

Currently available modalities have limitations in diagnosing CNS involvement in early stages of disease and have a limited prognostic value. Raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels can predict CNS involvement in patients with various neurological disorders including CNS leukemia. METHODS: This study was conducted in 23 consecutive freshly diagnosed patients of ALL without any previous CNS disease. Analysis of CSF was done for total LDH, proteins and electrolytes in all the patients before the start of chemotherapy and when the patients were in remission or 6 weeks after chemotherapy whichever was earlier. Twenty-three age and sex matched controls were also studied to set the normal reference range. The results were analyzed statistically by Student's t test and coefficient of co-relation between CSF LDH and protein in patients with raised CSF LDH at the time of presentation was also calculated. RESULTS: CSF LDH was increased in 4 out of 6 patients with signs and symptoms of CNS involvement (Group A) and 3 of these patients also had increased CSF protein levels. 2 out of 17 patients without signs and symptoms of CNS involvement (Group B) had both elevated CSF LDH and protein levels. The increased levels came down to normal reference values after chemotherapy except in one Group A patient in whom CSF LDH remained high. However, no significant change in CSF electrolytes was noted in these patients.

Of 883 adults undergoing allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 1998 and 2009, 179 (20%) required MV before day 100 posttransplantation. We evaluated the outcomes of these patients to develop a prognostic index to predict the 100-day post-MV overall survival (OS) based on factors present at the time of MV. The 179 patients were divided at random into a training set (n = 119) and a validation set (n = 60). The 100-day postventilation OS was 17% for the total population. Multivariate Cox regression on the training set identified creatinine <2 mg/dL and platelet count >20 x 10(9)/L as significant predictors of better OS. Recursive partitioning classified patients with these good prognostic criteria into class A (n = 76); all other patients were classified as class B (n = 103). Among class A patients, 100-day OS was 29% in the training set and 30% in the validation set. Corresponding OS in class B patients was 5% and 15%, respectively.

While previous studies indicate that indirubin is a promising therapeutic agent for CML, the molecular mechanism of action of indirubin is not fully understood. We report here that indirubin derivatives (IRDs) potently inhibit Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (Stat5) protein in CML cells. Compound E804, which is the most potent in this series of IRDs, blocked Stat5 signaling in human K562 CML cells, imatinib-resistant human KCL-22 CML cells expressing the T315I mutant Bcr-Abl (KCL-22M), and CD34-positive primary CML cells from patients. Autophosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) was strongly inhibited in K562 and KCL-22M cells at 5 muM E804, and in primary CML cells at 10 muM E804, although higher concentrations partially inhibited autophosphorylation of Bcr-Abl. Previous studies indicate that SFKs cooperate with Bcr-Abl to activate downstream Stat5 signaling. Activation of Stat5 was strongly blocked by E804 in CML cells. E804 down-regulated expression of Stat5 target proteins Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, associated with induction of apoptosis. In sum, our findings identify IRDs as potent inhibitors of the SFK/Stat5 signaling pathway downstream of Bcr-Abl, leading to apoptosis of K562, KCL-22M and primary CML cells. IRDs represent a promising structural class for development of new therapeutics for wild type or T315I mutant Bcr-Abl-positive CML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

A somatic chromosomal translocation detectable in 5% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involves E2A and results in expression of the oncogenic transcription factor E2A-PBX1. CREB binding protein (CBP) and its close paralog p300 are transcriptional co-activators with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. We and others have shown that direct binding of an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain present in E12/E47 and E2A-PBX1 to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 contributes to E2A protein function. In the current work we show for the first time that the catalytic HAT activity of CBP/p300 is increased in the presence of residues 1-483 of E2A (i.e., the portion present in E2A-PBX1). The addition of purified, recombinant E2A protein to in vitro assays results in a two-fold augmentation of CBP/p300 HAT activity, whereas in vivo assays show a ten-fold augmentation of HAT-dependent transcriptional induction and a five-fold augmentation of acetylation of reporter plasmid-associated histone by CBP in response to co-transfected E2A. Our results indicate that the HAT-enhancing effect is independent of the well-documented E2A-CBP interaction involving the KIX domain and suggest a role for direct, perhaps low affinity binding of E2A to a portion of CBP that includes the HAT domain and flanking elements. Our findings add to a growing body of literature indicating that interactions between CBP/p300 and transcription factors can function in a specific manner to modulate HAT catalytic activity.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Previously, we reported that curcumin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated depletion of GSH, which leads to caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis in mouse fibroblast cells (F. Thayyullathil et al., Free Radic. Biol. Med.45, 1403-1412, 2008). In this study, we investigated the antileukemic potential of curcumin in vitro, and we further examined the molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced apoptosis in human leukemic cells. Curcumin suppresses the growth of human leukemic cells via ROS-independent GSH depletion, which leads to caspase activation, inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity, and induction of ceramide (Cer) generation. Pretreatment of leukemic cells with carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone, a universal inhibitor of caspases, abrogates the SMS inhibition and Cer generation, and in turn prevents curcumin-induced cell death. Curcumin treatment of leukemic cells also downregulates the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), phospho-Akt, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Extracellular supplementation with GSH attenuates curcumin-induced depletion of GSH, caspase-dependent inhibition of SMS, Cer generation, and downregulation of IAPs, whereas, L-D-buthionine sulfoximine, a widely used inhibitor of GSH synthesis, potentiates GSH depletion, Cer generation, and apoptosis induced by curcumin. Taken together, our findings provide evidence suggesting for the first time that GSH regulates caspase-dependent inhibition of SMS activity, Cer generation, and apoptosis induced by curcumin in human leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Polyploidization in megakaryocytes (Mks), in contrast, is a highly controlled developmental process critical for efficient platelet production via unknown mechanisms. Using primary cells, we demonstrate that the guanine exchange factors GEF-H1 and ECT2, which are often overexpressed in cancer and are essential for RhoA activation during cytokinesis, must be downregulated for Mk polyploidization. The first (2N-4N) endomitotic cycle requires GEF-H1 downregulation, whereas subsequent cycles (>4N) require ECT2 downregulation. Exogenous expression of both GEF-H1 and ECT2 prevents endomitosis, resulting in proliferation of 2N Mks. Furthermore, we have shown that the mechanism by which polyploidization is prevented in Mks lacking Mkl1, which is mutated in megakaryocytic leukemia, is via elevated GEF-H1 expression; shRNA-mediated GEF-H1 knockdown alone rescues this ploidy defect. These mechanistic insights enhance our understanding of normal versus malignant megakaryocytopoiesis, as well as aberrant mitosis in aneuploid cancers.",['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Since survival significantly improves over time, treatment-related side effects become increasingly important. Glucocorticoids play an important role in the treatment of ALL, but they may suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The duration of HPA axis suppression is not yet well defined. The present study aimed at assessing the function of the HPA axis by determining the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and the dexamethasone (DEX) suppression test in children that were treated for childhood ALL, compared to a healthy age and sex matched reference group. In addition, questionnaires regarding sleep, fatigue, depression and quality of life were completed by the children and their parents. Fourty-three survivors who finished their treatment for childhood ALL 37 (interquartile range 22-75) months before and 57 healthy controls were included. No differences in CAR were observed between ALL survivors and the reference group, but survivors of ALL had higher morning cortisol levels and an increased cortisol suppression in response to oral dexamethasone. Higher cortisol levels in childhood ALL survivors were associated with more fatigue and poorer quality of life. We conclude that the experience of a stressful life event in the past may have caused a long-term dysregulation of the HPA axis in childhood ALL survivors, as reflected in an increased cortisol production and an enhanced negative feedback mechanism.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate critical and distinct roles for Sall4 in development of embryonic germ cells and differentiation of postnatal spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs). In differentiating SPCs, Sall4 levels transiently increase and Sall4 physically interacts with Plzf, a transcription factor exclusively required for adult stem cell maintenance. Mechanistically, Sall4 sequesters Plzf to noncognate chromatin domains to induce expression of Kit, a target of Plzf-mediated repression required for differentiation. Plzf in turn antagonizes Sall4 function by displacing Sall4 from cognate chromatin to induce Sall1 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that transcription factors required for embryonic tissue development postnatally take on distinct roles through interaction with opposing factors, which hence define properties of the adult stem cell compartment.",['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In adult female patients, breast cancer is the most common primary cancer. Herein, we report the case of a 49-year-old Taiwanese lady who developed t-ALL with t(4;11)(q21;q23) 16 months after cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy for her breast cancer. The unusual feature is that the t-ALL was heralded 4 months ago by marrow lymphocytosis comprising atypical small lymphocytes with condensed chromatin mimicking a B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Retrospective studies using additional antibodies for immunophenotyping and PCR-based clonality study for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement showed that these atypical small lymphocytes shared similar features with the leukemic blasts at the frank leukemic stage.

Mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in patients with glioma, leukemia, and other cancers. However, the incidence of IDH mutations in acute myeloid leukemia in Taiwan is much lower than that reported in Western countries. The reason for the difference is unknown and its clinical implications remain unclear. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogenous hematopoietic malignancy. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) results from chronic carcinogen exposures and is highly prevalent in trucking workers, especially in southern Taiwan. Subtypes of both diseases require specific treatments, and molecular markers for developing tailored treatments are limited. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is now a widely used methodology for rapid, accurate, and low-cost mutation scanning. In this study, 90 adults with OSC and 31 children with ALL were scanned by HRM analysis for IDH1 and IDH2 mutation hot spots. In ALL, the allele frequency was 3.23% in both IDH1 and IDH2. In OSCC, the allele frequency was 2.22% in IDH2. A synonymous mutation over pG313 (c.939A > G) of IDH2 was found in both pediatric ALL and adult OSCC. Therefore, we concluded that mutations of IDH are uncommon in ALL and OSCC and are apparently not a major consideration when selecting treatment modalities.",['Copyright (c) 2012.

In particular, TG2 is expressed in small intestine mucosa where it is up-regulated in active coeliac disease (CD). The aim of this work was to investigate the induction of TG2 expression by proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-15] and the signalling pathways involved, in human epithelial and monocytic cells and in intestinal tissue from controls and untreated CD patients. Here we report that IFN-gamma was the most potent inducer of TG2 expression in the small intestinal mucosa and in four [Caco-2, HT-29, Calu-6 and human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1)] of five cell lines tested. The combination of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma produced a strong synergistic effect. The use of selective inhibitors of signalling pathways revealed that induction of TG2 by IFN-gamma was mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), while c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were required for TNF-alpha activation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry and Western blot analysis showed that TG2 expression was blocked completely when stimulation by either TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma was performed in the presence of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitors (sulphasalazine and BAY-117082). TG2 was up-regulated substantially by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in intestinal mucosa in untreated CD compared with controls. This study shows that IFN-gamma, a dominant cytokine in intestinal mucosa in active CD, is the most potent inducer of TG2, and synergism with TNF-alpha may contribute to exacerbate the pathogenic mechanism of CD. Selective inhibition of signalling pathways may be of therapeutic benefit.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Recent reports described a BCR-JAK2 fusion gene in fatal chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, but the functional behavior of the chimeric protein remains uncharacterized. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to describe a BCR-JAK2 fusion gene from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient has been in complete remission for six years following treatment and autologous transplantation, and minimal residual disease was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. BCR-JAK2 codes for a protein containing the BCR oligomerization domain fused to the JAK2 tyrosine-kinase domain. In vitro analysis of transfected cells showed that BCR-JAK2 is located in the cytoplasm. Transduction of hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells with retroviral vectors carrying BCR-JAK2 induced IL-3-independent cell growth, constitutive activation of the chimeric protein as well as STAT5 phosphorylation and translocation to the nuclei, where Bcl-xL gene expression was elicited. Primary mouse progenitor cells transduced with BCR-JAK2 also showed increased proliferation and survival. Treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor TG101209 abrogated BCR-JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation, decreased Bcl-xL expression and triggered apoptosis of transformed Ba/F3 cells. Therefore, BCR-JAK2 is a novel tyrosine-kinase with transforming activity. It deregulates growth factor-dependent proliferation and cell survival, which can be abrogated by the TG101209 inhibitor. Moreover, transformed Ba/F3 cells developed tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice, thus proving the tumorigenic capacity of BCR-JAK2 in vivo. Together these findings suggest that adult and pediatric patients with BCR-ABL-negative leukemia and JAK2 overexpression may benefit from targeted therapies.",,"['Cuesta-Dominguez, Alvaro', 'Ortega, Mara', 'Ormazabal, Cristina', 'Santos-Roncero, Matilde', 'Galan-Diez, Marta', 'Steegmann, Juan Luis', 'Figuera, Angela', 'Arranz, Eva', 'Vizmanos, Jose Luis', 'Bueren, Juan A', 'Rio, Paula', 'Fernandez-Ruiz, Elena']","['Cuesta-Dominguez A', 'Ortega M', 'Ormazabal C', 'Santos-Roncero M', 'Galan-Diez M', 'Steegmann JL', 'Figuera A', 'Arranz E', 'Vizmanos JL', 'Bueren JA', 'Rio P', 'Fernandez-Ruiz E']","['Molecular Biology Unit, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Princesa and Red Espanola de Investigacion en Patologia Infecciosa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120227,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2012/03/03 06:00,2012/08/28 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0032451 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-01148 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e32451. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032451.

Thus, we investigated whether interleukin (IL)-27, an immunomodulatory cytokine, functions as an antitumor agent against pediatric AML cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of WSX-1 and gp130 on AML cells from 16 pediatric patients was studied by flow cytometry. Modulation of leukemia cell proliferation or apoptosis upon IL-27 treatment in vitro was tested by bromodeoxyuridine/propidium iodide (PI) and Ki67, or Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis. The angiogenic potential of AML cells treated or not with IL-27 was studied by chorioallantoic membrane assay and PCR array. In vivo studies were carried out using nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID)/Il2rg(-/-) mice injected intravenously with five pediatric AML cell samples. Leukemic cells engrafted in PBS and IL-27-treated animals were studied by immunohistochemical/morphologic analysis and by PCR array for expression angiogenic/dissemination-related genes. RESULTS: We provided the first demonstration that (i) AML cells injected into NOD/SCID/Il2rg(-/-) mice gave rise to leukemia dissemination that was severely hampered by IL-27, (ii) compared with controls, leukemia cells harvested from IL-27-treated mice showed significant reduction of their angiogenic and spreading related genes, and (iii) similarly to what was observed in vivo, IL-27 reduced in vitro AML cell proliferation and modulated the expression of different genes involved in the angiogenic/spreading process. CONCLUSION: These results provide an experimental rationale for the development of future clinical trials aimed at evaluating the toxicity and efficacy of IL-27.",,"['Zorzoli, Alessia', 'Di Carlo, Emma', 'Cocco, Claudia', 'Ognio, Emanuela', 'Ribatti, Domenico', 'Ferretti, Elisa', 'Dufour, Carlo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Montagna, Daniela', 'Airoldi, Irma']","['Zorzoli A', 'Di Carlo E', 'Cocco C', 'Ognio E', 'Ribatti D', 'Ferretti E', 'Dufour C', 'Locatelli F', 'Montagna D', 'Airoldi I']","['Department of Experimental and Laboratory Medicine, IRCCS G.

Germ cell degeneration in KS patients is thought to be the consequences of overexpression of some genes on the X-chromosome. However, the identity of these genes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Testis-expressed 11 (TEX11) is an X-chromosome-encoded germ-cell-specific protein that is expressed most abundantly in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes in the testes. In our search for TEX11-interacting partners using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified hematopoietic pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor-interacting protein (HPIP), which anchors estrogen receptors (ER) to the cytoskeleton and modulates their functions. We found that mouse spermatogonial stem cells expressed Tex11, Hpip, and Esr2 but not Esr1. In cultured cells, TEX11 competed with ERbeta for binding to HPIP. Upon treatment with 17beta-estradiol or an ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile, TEX11 promoted the nuclear translocation of ERbeta and enhanced its transcriptional activities. On the other hand, TEX11 suppressed the nongenomic activities of ERbeta in the cytoplasm, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK signaling molecules. Overexpression of TEX11 in mouse germ-cell-derived GC-1 and GC-2 cells suppressed the cell proliferation and the expression of cFos, Ccnd1, and Ccnb1 that were stimulated by 17beta-estradiol or diarylpropionitrile and elevated the expression level of the proapoptotic Bax gene. The negative effect of TEX11 on cell proliferation suggests that increased expression of TEX11 in the germ cells may partially contribute to the spermatogenic defect observed in KS patients.",,"['Yu, Yueh-Hsiang', 'Siao, Fong-Ping', 'Hsu, Lea Chia-Ling', 'Yen, Pauline H']","['Yu YH', 'Siao FP', 'Hsu LC', 'Yen PH']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120301,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TEX11 protein, human)', '0 (Tex11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism/*physiology', 'Estradiol/physiology', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/agonists/*metabolism', 'Estrogens/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Klinefelter Syndrome/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2012/03/03 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2011-1263 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2011-1263 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2012 Apr;26(4):630-42. doi: 10.1210/me.2011-1263.

The effectivity of these therapies is limited and the development of alternative approaches is necessary. In the present study, we report on the use of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and their derivatives which mimic endocrine and chemotherapy resistance. (3)H-thymidine incorporation assays revealed that sorafenib causes a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of all cell lines associated with downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin D1 expression. Apoptosis was induced at 2 muM of sorafenib in androgen-sensitive cells, whereas a higher dose of the drug was needed in castration-resistant cell lines. Sorafenib stimulated apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines through downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) expression and Akt phosphorylation. Although concentrations of sorafenib required for the antitumor effect in therapy-resistant sublines were higher than those needed in parental cells, the drug showed efficacy in cells which became resistant to bicalutamide and docetaxel respectively. Most interestingly, we show that sorafenib has an inhibitory effect on androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen expression. In cells in which AR expression was downregulated by short interfering RNA, the treatment with sorafenib increased apoptosis in an additive manner. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that there is a potential to use sorafenib in prostate cancers as an adjuvant therapy option to current androgen ablation treatments, but also in progressed prostate cancers that become unresponsive to standard therapies.",,"['Oh, Su Jung', 'Erb, Holger H H', 'Hobisch, Alfred', 'Santer, Frederic R', 'Culig, Zoran']","['Oh SJ', 'Erb HH', 'Hobisch A', 'Santer FR', 'Culig Z']","['Division of Experimental Urology, Department of Urology, Innsbruck Medical University, Anichstrasse 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120503,England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Androgen Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Androgen Receptor Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorafenib']",2012/03/03 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ERC-11-0298 [pii]', '10.1530/ERC-11-0298 [doi]']",epublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2012 May 3;19(3):305-19. doi: 10.1530/ERC-11-0298.

The impact of V617F point mutation and its allele burden on overall survival (OS) and the risk of leukemic transformation (LT) has been the subject of several studies, but the results were ambiguous. Our study included 77 patients with the following variants: 42 patients with PMF (55%), 16 with post-ET MF (21%) and 19 with post-PV MF (24%). Median age at diagnosis for the entire cohort was 61 years (range 19-81), with 53% of female. A total of 42 patients were JAK2V617F positive, giving an overall frequency of 55%; the median allele burden was 22% (range 2-96%). The JAK2V617F point mutation was detected in 21 patients with PMF (50%), 14 with post-PV MF (88%) and 7 with post-ET MF (37%). Lower JAK2V617F allele burden was more frequently detected in PMF patients, whereas higher allele burden was predominantly seen in post-PV/ET MF group. There was no significant difference between V617F-positive and V617F-negative patients in terms of studied parameters in PMF as well as in post-PV/ET MF subgroup. No significant difference was also demonstrated when the above-mentioned subpopulations were analyzed according to JAK2V617F allele burden, except higher leukocyte count in post-PV/ET MF patients with higher allele burden (14.3x10(9)/L vs. 6.2x10(9)/L; p=.03). Median follow-ups for V617F-positive and V617F-negative patients were 16.6 months (range 3.6-206.4) and 36.4 months (range 2.5-142.1), respectively.

In addition to having to install more robust equipment for handling large bodies, the quality of autopsy examinations may be reduced by the physical difficulties that arise in trying to position bodies correctly so that normal examinations can proceed. Accelerated putrefaction is often an added complication. Metabolic disturbances resulting from obesity increase susceptibility to a range of conditions that are associated with sudden and unexpected death, and surgery may have increased complications. The rates of a number of different malignancies, including lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma and multiple myeloma, and carcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, gallbladder, thyroid, prostate, breast and endometrium, are increased. In addition, obese individuals have higher rates of diabetes mellitus, and sepsis. The unexpected collapse of an obese individual should raise the possibility of a wide range of conditions, many of which may be more difficult to demonstrate at autopsy than in an individual with a normal body mass index.

Here, we present the immunological and genetic analyses of 20 primary Chlamydia psittaci (Cp)-negative OAMZLs. Analysis of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgV(H)) gene usage demonstrated a significant preference for V(H)4-34. A combined analysis across all previously published OAMZLs confirmed that this is a general feature of OAMZL, in particular of the Cp-negative group. Our series of OAMZLs did not express the characteristic rheumatoid factor V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements that were previously found in salivary gland- and gastric-marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCLs). We did not detect the MZBCL-specific chromosomal translocations, t(11;18) API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue1) and t(14;18) IgH/MALT1. Two cases contained a premature stop codon in the A20 gene (TNFAIP3) and one case harbored the activating MYD88 hotspot mutation L265P. Variable nuclear expression of BCL10, NFkappaB1 (p50) and NFkappaB2 (p52) suggests that other additional genetic abnormalities affecting the NFkappaB pathway exist within this group of lymphomas. OAMZL showed variable expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and integrin alpha4beta7 by the tumor B cells, and low interferon-gamma and interlukin-4 mRNA levels in the tissue, indicative of an inflammatory environment with features in between those previously found in cutaneous and other extranodal MZBCL.

A systemic analysis of genetic aberrations was performed in a cohort of 1346 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in China. The pediatric patients had higher incidence of hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) (p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 than adults (P<0.0001); in contrast, the occurrence of Ph and Ik6 variant of IKZF1 gene was much more frequent in adult patients (all P<0.0001). In B-ALL, the existence of Ik6 and that of BCR-ABL were statistically correlated (P<0.0001). In comparison with Western cohorts, the incidence of t(9;22) (q34;q11)/BCR-ABL (14.60%) in B-ALL and HOX11 expression in T-ALL (25.24%) seemed to be much higher in our group, while the incidence of t(12;21) (p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 (15.34%) seemed to be lower in Chinese pediatric patients. The occurrence of hyperdiploidy was much lower either in pediatric (10.61% vs 20-38%) or adult patients (2.36% vs 6.77-12%) in our study than in Western reports. In addition, the frequencies of HOX11L2 in adult patients were much higher in our cohort than in Western countries (20.69% vs 4-11%).

Aurora kinase inhibitors are in early clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia. We hypothesized that Aurora B inhibition would reduce malignant glioma cell viability and result in impaired tumor growth in vivo. Aurora B expression is greater in cultured malignant glioma U251 cells compared to proliferating normal human astrocytes, and expression is maintained in U251 flank xenografts. Aurora B inhibition with AZD1152-HQPA blocked cell division in four different p53-mutant glioma cell lines (U251, T98G, U373, and U118). AZD1152-HQPA also inhibited Aurora C activation loop threonine autophosphorylation at the effective antiproliferative concentrations in vitro. Reduction in cell viability of U251 (p53(R273H)) cells was secondary to cytokinesis blockade and apoptosis induction following endoreplication. AZD1152-HQPA inhibited the growth of U251 tumor xenografts and resulted in an increase in tumor cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Subcutaneous administration of AZD1152-HQPA (25 mg/kg/day x 4 days; 2 cycles spaced 7 days apart) resulted in a prolongation in median survival after intracranial inoculation of U251 cells in mice (P = 0.025).

There is a paucity data on cytogenetic and molecular analyses of Indian CML patients. This apparently reflects the low availability of cytogenetic and molecular techniques in our country. This study aimed to document various types of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in different phases of CML and to compare the Ph chromosome positivity/negativity vis-a-vis BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in adult CML patients. METHODS: Between June 2004 and February 2009, 208 patients were diagnosed as CML in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis (BC), according to standard criteria. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses were performed in all patients. Various types of BCR-ABL hybrid transcripts were compared with phases of CML and cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: Among 208 CML patients, b3a2 BCR-ABL transcripts were most commonly detected (66.82%) followed by b2a2 (28.84%), b3a2 + b2a2 (3.36%), b3a2 + e19a2 (0.48%) and b2a2 + e19a2 (0.48%). b3a2 transcripts were more frequently detected than b2a2 transcripts, in the whole group of 208 as well as in 183 CML-CP patients (P<0.0001). Ph chromosome was positive in 135 of 139 patients with b3a2 transcripts and 56 of 60 patients with b2a2 transcripts, difference not being significant. Additional cytogenetic abnormalities detected in 3.8 per cent patients in CML-CP and 44 per cent patients in CML-AP/BC, did not show predilection for any BCR-ABL transcript type. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study documents higher Ph positivity (96.15%) by cytogenetic analysis among CML patients, as confirmed by qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in a large patient group from north India. Both the techniques contribute towards understanding the disease biology, and have important implications for diagnosis and management of CML patients.",,"['Anand, Maninder Singh', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Rana, Kamer Singh', 'Malhotra, Pankaj']","['Anand MS', 'Varma N', 'Varma S', 'Rana KS', 'Malhotra P']","['Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/03/03 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2012_135_1_42_93423 [pii]', '10.4103/0971-5916.93423 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2012;135:42-8. doi: 10.4103/0971-5916.93423.,,,,,PMC3307183,,,,,,,['Indian J Med Res. 2012;135:12-3.

This study aimed to identify the main trans-acting factors that bind within the URR to transcriptionally repress PrmIP-directed gene expression in the megakaryoblastic human erythroleukemia (HEL) 92.1.7 cell line. Of the putative cis-acting elements examined, disruption of C/EBP and PU.1 elements within the URR substantially increased PrmIP-directed gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) confirmed that C/EBPdelta and PU.1, but not C/EBPbeta, bind to the URR in vivo, while ectopic expression of C/EBPdelta substantially reduced hIP mRNA levels and PrmIP-directed gene expression. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation increased hIP mRNA and PrmIP-directed reporter gene expression and hIP-mediated cAMP generation in HEL cells. Two PMA-responsive regions, termed PRR1 and PRR2, were identified within PrmIP. Disruption of C/EBPdelta and PU.1 cis-elements within the overlapping PRR1/URR and of Sp1, PU.1 and Oct-1 cis-elements within the overlapping PRR2/core PrmIP, revealed that both PRR1 and PRR2 contribute to the PMA- induction of hIP mRNA and gene expression in HEL cells. Furthermore, ChIP analysis established that induction of PrmIP-directed gene expression during megakaryocytic differentiation is largely regulated by PMA-induced dissociation of C/EBPdelta and enhanced binding of PU.1 to PRR1 in addition to increased binding of Sp1, PU.1 and Oct-1 to elements within the core promoter/PRR2 in vivo. Taken together, these data provide critical insights into the transcriptional regulation of the hIP gene within the vasculature, including during megakaryocytic differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Its ability to react to different stimuli impacts a variety of conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, urticaria and anaphylaxis. It is not until recent decades that the evolution of the cell has been described and its fascinating biology has only recently been depicted. We here give a review of systemic mastocytosis in regards to cell biology, diagnostic approaches and clinical practice. METHODS: A search was made in PubMed in August 2011 entering the keywords: mastocytosis, (systemic, cutaneous, aggressive), mast cell leukaemia, mast cell sarcoma, chromosome, mutation, haematology and treatment. RESULTS: Mastocytosis is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of mast cells, which accumulate in one or several organ systems, primarily the skin and bone marrow. The disease is clinically heterogeneous and varies from a relatively benign condition with isolated cutaneous lesions to a very aggressive systemic condition with a grave prognosis. The condition affects men and women equally. Children are especially affected by the cutaneous form. In most children, the condition will improve or remit spontaneously before adulthood. Mastocytosis in adults, however, is more often systemic and tends to persist. CONCLUSION: Patients with mastocytosis represent a heterogeneous group in terms of clinical presentation, management and prognosis. Furthermore, a range of medical specialties serve as the primary entrance to health services, which can be a challenge in respect of achieving uniform management. In order to improve diagnostics and management of systemic mastocytosis, the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis has been established. Patients under suspicion of systemic mastocytosis should be conferred with or referred to a haematological and a dermatological/allergological department.",,"['Andersen, Christen Lykkegaard', 'Kristensen, Thomas Kielsgaard', 'Severinsen, Marianne Tang', 'Moller, Michael Boe', 'Vestergaard, Hanne', 'Bergmann, Olav J', 'Hasselbalch, Hans Carl', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis']","['Andersen CL', 'Kristensen TK', 'Severinsen MT', 'Moller MB', 'Vestergaard H', 'Bergmann OJ', 'Hasselbalch HC', 'Bjerrum OW']","['Department of Haematology, Roskilde Hospital, Denmark. christenla@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,Denmark,Dan Med J,Danish medical journal,101576205,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)']",IM,"['Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Histamine Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",2012/03/03 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['A4397 [pii]'],ppublish,Dan Med J. 2012 Mar;59(3):A4397.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), we found that the endogenous anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bcl-xL prevented apoptosis initiated by H(2)O(2). The BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only Bcl-2 protein Noxa was required for H(2)O(2)-induced cell death and was the single BH3-only Bcl-2 protein whose pro-apoptotic activity was completely antagonized by endogenous Bcl-xL. Upon H(2)O(2) treatment, Noxa mRNA displayed the greatest increase among BH3-only Bcl-2 proteins. Expression levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1), the primary binding target of Noxa, were reduced in H(2)O(2)-treated cells in a Noxa-dependent manner, and Mcl-1 overexpression was able to prevent H(2)O(2)-induced cell death in Bcl-xL-deficient MEF cells. Importantly, reduction of the expression of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL caused spontaneous cell death. These studies reveal a signalling pathway in which H(2)O(2) activates Noxa, leading to a decrease in Mcl-1 and subsequent cell death in the absence of Bcl-xL expression. The results of the present study indicate that both anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins co-operate to regulate oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.",,"['Eno, Colins O', 'Zhao, Guoping', 'Olberding, Kristen E', 'Li, Chi']","['Eno CO', 'Zhao G', 'Olberding KE', 'Li C']","['Molecular Targets Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*physiology']",2012/03/03 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/03/03 06:00'],"['2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20112023 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20112023 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2012 May 15;444(1):69-78. doi: 10.1042/BJ20112023.,,,,,,"['CA106599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR018733/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Early death in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.,1-16,,"With the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has become a highly curable malignancy. Approximately 90% of patients achieve complete remission with induction, which generally includes ATRA and an anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Early death, either before treatment is initiated or during induction, has emerged as one of the most critical issues involved in the current care of patients with APL. The main cause of early death in APL is bleeding, often intracranial. It has become increasingly clear that induction therapy should be initiated in patients at the earliest time possible, even before confirmation of the diagnosis of APL has been made. In this roundtable, several experts discuss important insights into the high rate of early death observed in APL.

Coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and some special features of duodenal anatomy, e.g. relatively fixed position in the retroperitoneum and numerous submucosal blood vessels, have been suggested as a cause for IDH. The typical clinical presentation of IDH is severe abdominal pain and vomiting due to duodenal obstruction. In addition, it is often associated with pancreatitis and cholestasis. Diagnosis is confirmed using imaging techniques such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography and upper intestinal series. Once diagnosis is confirmed and intestinal perforation excluded, conservative treatment with nasogastric tube and parenteral nutrition is sufficient. We present a case of massive IDH following endoscopic grasp forceps biopsy in a 5-year-old girl without bleeding disorder or other risk for IDH, which caused duodenal obstruction and mild pancreatitis and resolved within 2 weeks of conservative management. Since duodenal biopsies have become the common way to evaluate children or adults for suspected enteropathy, the occurrence of this complication is likely to increase.

In the present study, we quantified the CD33 mean fluorescent intensity of leukemic blasts prospectively in 619 de novo pediatric AML patients enrolled in Children's Oncology Group GO-containing clinical trials and determined its correlation with disease characteristics and clinical outcome. CD33 expression varied more than 2-log fold; a median mean fluorescent intensity of 129 (range, 3-1550.07) was observed. Patients were divided into 4 quartiles, quartiles 1-4 (Q1-4) based on expression and disease characteristics and clinical response defined across quartiles. High CD33 expression was associated with high-risk FLT3/ITD mutations (P < .001) and was inversely associated with low-risk disease (P < .001). Complete remission (CR) rates were similar, but patients in Q4 had significantly lower overall survival (57% +/- 16% vs 77% +/- 7%, P = .002) and disease-free survival from CR (44% +/- 16% vs 62% +/- 8%, P = .022). In a multivariate model, high CD33 expression remained a significant predictor of overall survival (P = .011) and disease-free survival (P = .038) from CR. Our findings suggest that CD33 expression is heterogeneous within de novo pediatric AML.

Whereas restoring the expression of p85alpha in P85alpha(-/-) cells restores these functions, overexpression of p85beta has the opposite effect. Consistently, overexpression of p85beta in WT mast cells represses KIT-induced proliferation and IL-3-mediated maturation by inhibiting the expression of Microphthalmia transcription factor. Because p85alpha and p85beta differ in their N-terminal sequences, chimeric proteins consisting of amino or carboxy-terminal of p85alpha and/or p85beta do not rescue the growth defects of p85alpha(-/-) cells, suggesting cooperation between these domains for normal mast cell function. Loss of p85beta impaired ligand induced KIT receptor internalization and its overexpression enhanced this process, partly because of increased binding of c-Cbl to p85beta relative to p85alpha. In vivo, loss of p85beta resulted in increased mast cells, and bone marrow transplantation of cells overexpressing p85beta resulted in significant reduction in some tissue mast cells. Overexpression of p85beta suppressed the growth of oncogenic KIT-expressing cells in vitro and prolonged the survival of leukemic mice in vivo.

Past treatment protocols have called for routine screening via bone marrow aspiration (BMA) after achievement of first complete remission (CR1) to detect relapse at an early stage. However, supporting evidence for this policy is lacking for non-FAB type-M3 patients. PROCEDURE: We therefore retrospectively studied the clinical relevance of routine BMA in an unselected cohort of all pediatric AML patients in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Of 440 patients, data for 349 patients, of whom 148 suffered bone marrow relapse (BM-relapse), could be analyzed. A total of 1,790 BMAs had been performed, 1,648 (92%) routinely, and 142 (8%) on indication when a relapse was suspected. Forty routine BMAs showed BM-relapse (2% of all routine BMAs), while as many as 108 (76%) hematological relapses were confirmed by BMA on indication (P < 0.001). Therefore, 1 in 41 routine BMAs, as opposed to 1 in 1.3 BMAs performed on indication, detected a BM-relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Routine BMA after CR1 did not significantly contribute to early detection of relapsed AML. These results suggest that BMA after achievement of CR1 should only be performed on indication or within a clinical research setting. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012; 59: 1239-1244.

The prevalence and prognostic significance of FLT3/Mut have not been well defined in childhood acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PROCEDURE: Diagnostic specimens from 104 pediatric APL patients were screened for FLT3/Mut (FLT3/ITD or FLT3/ALM). FLT3/Mut status was correlated with disease characteristics and clinical outcome for patients treated on CALGB C9710 (n = 50). RESULTS: Forty-two of the 104 patients (40%) had either FLT3/ITD (n = 28, 27%) or FLT3/ALM (n = 15, 14%). Median diagnostic WBC count was 23,400 cells/microl vs. 3,600 cells/microl for those with and without FLT3/Mut (P < 0.001), and similar results for the cohort of 50 patients treated on C9710 (P < 0.001). In patients treated on C9710, presence of a FLT3 mutation was highly correlated with diagnostic WBC count >10,000 (P = 0.004), microgranular variant histology (P = 0.035), and a lower remission rate (P = 0.009). In patients who received ATRA (C9710 or CCG-2911, n = 8), those with FLT3/Mut had an induction death rate of 30% (7/23) compared to 3% (1/35) in FLT3/WT patients (P = 0.005). In patients with high WBC counts (>10,000), those with FLT3/Mut had a significantly higher risk of induction death versus FLT3/WT patients (47% vs. 0%, P = 0.05). FLT3/Mut was not associated with adverse outcome in those who survived induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3/Mut are prevalent in pediatric APL and are associated with high WBC count and increased induction death. This study provides further evidence for testing APL patients for FLT3/Mut and the potential role for FLT3 inhibitors in this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kutny, Matthew A', 'Moser, Barry K', 'Laumann, Kristina', 'Feusner, James H', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Gregory, John', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Woods, William G', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Kutny MA', 'Moser BK', 'Laumann K', 'Feusner JH', 'Gamis A', 'Gregory J', 'Larson RA', 'Powell BL', 'Stock W', 'Willman CL', 'Woods WG', 'Meshinchi S']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA. mkutny@peds.uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120229,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/03/02 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/03/02 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24122 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Oct;59(4):662-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24122.

Given its ease of administration and manageable side effects in adults, imatinib mesylate was introduced as therapy for pediatric CML. Recently published case reports describe growth deceleration in children treated with imatinib. This study details the growth phenotype of seven pediatric patients maintained in remission on imatnib mesylate over an extended period of time. PROCEDURE: This study is a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with CML at Oregon Health & Science University treated with imatinib. Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) measurements were collected before and during treatment. Median standard deviation scores (SDS) were analyzed by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and Wilcoxon signed rank cohort analysis. RESULTS: Individual patient analysis demonstrated five of seven subjects with a statistically significant decrease in height SDS pre versus during treatment. The whole group analysis showed a trend to significance for difference in median height SDS pre and during treatment (P = 0.078). Bone age was delayed in all four patients in whom bone ages were obtained. IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and thyroid levels during treatment were normal. Four patients experienced an improvement in height SDS during puberty. However, three patients approaching near final adult height failed to achieve genetic height potential determined by mid-parental target height. CONCLUSION: Growth in children with CML appears to be adversely impacted by imatinib therapy. BMI and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 are maintained during treatment, suggesting a direct effect of imatinib on the growth plate.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Rastogi, Maynika V', 'Stork, Linda', 'Druker, Brian', 'Blasdel, Carolyn', 'Nguyen, Thuan', 'Boston, Bruce A']","['Rastogi MV', 'Stork L', 'Druker B', 'Blasdel C', 'Nguyen T', 'Boston BA']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20120229,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IGFBP3 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Body Height/*drug effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thyroid Hormones/blood', 'Time Factors']",2012/03/02 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/03/02 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24121 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Nov;59(5):840-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24121.

This study examines the effects of novel 9-aminoacridine carboxamides, synthesised by click chemistry based upon the reactions of either 9-(2-azidoethyl)amino or 9-propargylaminoacridine compounds, on various types of DNA tertiary structures. This gave either monomeric or dimeric compounds, the dimeric derivatives being the first unsymmetrical acridine dimers to be described. The compounds were assayed for duplex DNA, quadruplex DNA and four-way junction DNA binding. Their antiproliferative activity in the Human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL60, was also assessed. Although for some of the compounds, notably the acridine 4-carboxamides, activity correlated with DNA binding affinity, for others it did not, with the rigidly linked dimers in particular showing a complicated relationship between 3- and 4-carboxamide structure and biological activity. The monomeric 3-carboxamides were more effective at stabilising G-quadruplex structures and also gave more hits in the four-way junction stabilisation assay.

The putative Nanog target genes identified by Nanog silencing were verified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction after Nanog overexpression. Downregulation of Nanog in P19 cells resulted in reduction of pluripotency markers, such as Fgf4, Klf2, Mtf2, Oct-4, Rex1, Sox1, Yes, and Zfp143, whereas overexpression of Nanog in P19 cells reversely upregulated their expression. However, expressions of pluripotency markers Cripto, germ cell nuclear factor, Sox2, and Zfp57 as well as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/Stat3 pathway molecules LIF, IL6st, and Stat3 were not affected after 48 h transfection with Nanog siRNA or construct. Nanog silencing also downregulated expression of molecules involved in the p53- and cell cycle-signaling pathway (Atf3, Jdp2, Cul3, Hist1hic, and Bcl6), whereas expression of E2f1, Tob1, Lyn, and Smarcc1 was upregulated by Nanog silencing. Expressions of cyclins D1, D2, D3, and E1 as well as cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1 and Cdk6 were downregulated by Nanog silencing in P19 cells, whereas Nanog overexpression reversely increased their expressions.

In the present study, we tested whether a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the bufadienolide CTS, marinobufagenin (MBG), alleviates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in partially nephrectomized (PNx) rats. METHODS: In PNx rats, we compared the effects of 3E9 anti-MBG mAb and of Digibind, an affinity-purified digoxin antibody, on blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis following 4 weeks after the surgery. RESULTS: In PNx rats, a fourfold elevation in plasma MBG levels was associated with hypertension, increased cardiac levels of carbonylated protein, cardiac hypertrophy, a reduction in cardiac expression of a nuclear transcription factor which is a negative regulator of collagen synthesis, Friend leukemia integration-1 (Fli-1), and an increase in the levels of collagen-1. A single intraperitoneal administration of 3E9 mAb to PNx rats reduced blood pressure by 59 mm Hg for 7 days and produced a significant reduction in cardiac weight and cardiac levels of oxidative stress, an increase in the expression of Fli-1, and a reduction in cardiac fibrosis. The effects of Digibind were similar to those of 3E9 mAb, but were less pronounced.

However, the role of AnxA1 during the process of granulocytic differentiation is still unknown. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can induce acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) cells to differentiate along the granulocytic lineage and has been used successfully in treating APL patients. In this study, we investigated whether or not AnxA1 contributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of ATRA-treated APL (NB4; ATRA-NB) cells using the transmigratory and adhesive assays. We found that ATRA was able to enhance the surface expression of AnxA1 and its receptor (FPR2/ALX) and the release of AnxA1-containing MPs from ATRA-NB4 cells, while the expression of annexin V was not elevated on the latter cells. Further studies demonstrated that exogenous AnxA1 could inhibit ATRA-NB4 cells in their transmigratory activity and adhesion to endothelial cells. In addition, the transmigratory activity of ATRA-NB4 cells can be significantly enhanced by pretreatment with a FPR2/ALX neutralizing antibody, suggesting that endogenous AnxA1 may contribute to the anti-migratory effects. Finally, ATRA-NB4-derived MPs could also inhibit recipient cells in their transmigratory and adhesive activities and these anti-inflammatory effects could be inhibited by pretreatment of MPs with a specific anti-AnxA1 antibody. Flowcytometry studies further demonstrated that FITC-labeled AnxA1 could be transported from MPs to the membrane of recipient ATRA-NB4 cells. We conclude that biologically active AnxA1 may play a role in the anti-inflammatory properties of ATRA-treated APL cells during the process of granulocytic differentiation.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tsai, Wen-Hui', 'Chien, Hong-Yu', 'Shih, Chung-Hung', 'Lai, Shu-Lien', 'Li, I-Ting', 'Hsu, Shau-Chieh', 'Kou, Yu Ru', 'Hsu, Hui-Chi']","['Tsai WH', 'Chien HY', 'Shih CH', 'Lai SL', 'Li IT', 'Hsu SC', 'Kou YR', 'Hsu HC']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (FPR2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoxin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Annexin A1/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lipoxin/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2012/03/02 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/03/02 06:00'],"['2012/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24073 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Nov;227(11):3661-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24073.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epidermis has biochemical, physical, immunological and anti-infective properties, and is the most important shield against aggressors. Chronic immunosuppression impairs this cutaneous quality and therefore numerous mucocutaneous complications can occur. The physiological colonization of commensal microbes helps to limit the expansion of pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi by a continuous release of antimicrobial peptides from keratinocytes. Genetic or acquired immunodeficiency influences these factors. Malignant neoplastic diseases such as leukemia or lymphomas can also lead to severe immunodeficiency. Drug-induced immunodeficiency is common in organ-transplanted patients with the aim to prevent organ rejection. Such patients with prolonged immunodeficiency often develop atypical presentations of mucocutaneous infections. This is the reason why such patients should be biopsied liberally. In addition to the conventional histology, a part of the biopsy should be used for microbiological cultures. Long-term complications of oncogenic viruses have to be considered leading to epithelial cancers (HPV), Kaposi sarcomas (HHV8), lymphomas (EBV) and Merkel cell tumor (polyomavirus) apart from more known acute infections of the skin. Important mucocutaneous markers of immunosuppression such as oral hairy leukoplakia, oral candidiasis and eczema molluscatum exist.

Only two regimens were allowed: melphalan, alemtuzumab, fludarabine and total body irradiation of 200 cGy (regimen A) and thiotepa, cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin (regimen B). The outcome of patients receiving an UD transplant (n=121) was compared with patients who did not find a donor (n=205), in a time dependent analysis, correcting for time to transplant. The median follow up from activation of donor search was 6.1 years. UD transplant was associated with a significantly better survival in patients with acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) whereas only a favorable trend was documented for Hodgkin's disease. No survival benefit was registered for chronic leukemias.

STAT3 activation might promote cellular transformation and therefore have an important role in human tumors. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between STAT3 polymorphisms and treatment response of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the Chinese population. METHODS: Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in 130 patients with AML. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and assayed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: The results of response to chemotherapy showed that there were strong relationships between unfavorable cytogenetics, partial remission (and even no remission), and GG genotype frequency in rs9909659 (P = 0.01 and 0.03). Patients younger than 45 years were associated significantly with GA/AA genotype (P = 0.01).

Secondary objective was to give further evidence for bioequivalence between ASNase medac and a new recombinant ASNase preparation. The authors reanalyzed 233 plasma samples from 16 children treated according to the DCOG-ALL 10 protocol (5000 U/m(2) ASNase medac) using NONMEM. Subsequently, assessment of bioequivalence was performed by including the preparation as a categorical covariate into the PopPK model when analyzing data of both preparations (480 samples, 32 children). A linear 2-compartment model with first-order elimination sufficiently described ASNase medac pharmacokinetics. The parameters found were as follows: total body clearance 0.13 L/h +/- 12.4% per 1.73 m(2), volume of distribution in the central compartment 4.11 L +/- 12.3% per 70 kg, volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment 1.63 L per 70 kg and intercompartmental clearance 0.106 L/h (mean +/- interindividual variability). A visual predictive check procedure and simulation of different dosages ASNase medac administered in the ALL-BFM protocol indicated adequate model performance. Assessment of bioequivalence provided a difference of about 14% in clearance of both preparations being too small to be considered as clinically relevant. A population pharmacokinetic model of ASNase medac in pediatric patients with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia was established.

METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis to twice-daily oral ruxolitinib (155 patients) or placebo (154 patients). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a reduction in spleen volume of 35% or more at 24 weeks, assessed by means of magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary end points included the durability of response, changes in symptom burden (assessed by the total symptom score), and overall survival. RESULTS: The primary end point was reached in 41.9% of patients in the ruxolitinib group as compared with 0.7% in the placebo group (P<0.001). A reduction in spleen volume was maintained in patients who received ruxolitinib; 67.0% of the patients with a response had the response for 48 weeks or more. There was an improvement of 50% or more in the total symptom score at 24 weeks in 45.9% of patients who received ruxolitinib as compared with 5.3% of patients who received placebo (P<0.001). Thirteen deaths occurred in the ruxolitinib group as compared with 24 deaths in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.98; P=0.04). The rate of discontinuation of the study drug because of adverse events was 11.0% in the ruxolitinib group and 10.6% in the placebo group. Among patients who received ruxolitinib, anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse events, but they rarely led to discontinuation of the drug (in one patient for each event). Two patients had transformation to acute myeloid leukemia; both were in the ruxolitinib group. CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib, as compared with placebo, provided significant clinical benefits in patients with myelofibrosis by reducing spleen size, ameliorating debilitating myelofibrosis-related symptoms, and improving overall survival. These benefits came at the cost of more frequent anemia and thrombocytopenia in the early part of the treatment period.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a potent and selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor, as compared with the best available therapy, in patients with myelofibrosis. METHODS: We assigned 219 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis to receive oral ruxolitinib or the best available therapy. The primary end point and key secondary end point of the study were the percentage of patients with at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume at week 48 and at week 24, respectively, as assessed with the use of magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. RESULTS: A total of 28% of the patients in the ruxolitinib group had at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume at week 48, as compared with 0% in the group receiving the best available therapy (P<0.001); the corresponding percentages at week 24 were 32% and 0% (P<0.001). At 48 weeks, the mean palpable spleen length had decreased by 56% with ruxolitinib but had increased by 4% with the best available therapy. The median duration of response with ruxolitinib was not reached, with 80% of patients still having a response at a median follow-up of 12 months. Patients in the ruxolitinib group had an improvement in overall quality-of-life measures and a reduction in symptoms associated with myelofibrosis. The most common hematologic abnormalities of grade 3 or higher in either group were thrombocytopenia and anemia, which were managed with a dose reduction, interruption of treatment, or transfusion. One patient in each group discontinued treatment owing to thrombocytopenia, and none discontinued owing to anemia. Nonhematologic adverse events were rare and mostly grade 1 or 2. Two cases of acute myeloid leukemia were reported with the best available therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous ruxolitinib therapy, as compared with the best available therapy, was associated with marked and durable reductions in splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms, improvements in role functioning and quality of life, and modest toxic effects. An influence on overall survival has not yet been shown.

Unfortunately, in most disseminated cancers, such treatments cannot lead to complete cure. Many different mechanisms have been described to explain this resistance. The hypothesis of the existence of ""cancer stem cells ""has been recently proposed. Indeed, the tumour would contain a small subpopulation of cancer cells displaying the phenotypical characteristics of multipotential stem cells. Since such cells display different signalling pathways compared with more differentiated cells, this might explain at least partially the resistance to treatments. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a good model in favour of cancer stem cells, but the presence of such cells in all types of cancers is still a matter of debate. Several questions emerge: is the multipotential stem cell, the cell of origin of cancer? What is the relevance of the cancer stem cell paradigm for understanding cancer cell biology and to envision new therapeutic, hopefully curative, therapies?

In the present study, we have investigated serum levels of HSP70/HSP90 and the serum cytokine profiles of patients with untreated AML and patients receiving AML-stabilizing palliative treatment based on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus valproic acid. Patients with untreated AML showed increased HSP90 levels and a distinct serum cytokine profile when compared with healthy controls, and low pre-therapy HSP90 levels were associated with a prolonged survival during treatment with ATRA + valproic acid + theophyllin. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a close association between HSP70, HSP90, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. Furthermore, disease-stabilizing therapy altered the serum-cytokine profile, but the correlations between HSP70/HSP90/IL-1ra/HGF were maintained only when ATRA + valproic acid were combined with theophyllin but not when combined with cytarabine. We conclude that both HSP levels and serum cytokine profiles are altered and may represent possible therapeutic targets or prognostic markers in human AML.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Fredly, Hanne', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Fredly H', 'Reikvam H', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. hanne.fredly@med.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120228,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*blood', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Theophylline/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Valproic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2012/03/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23116 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Apr;87(4):368-76. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23116.

We recently reported an association between different prognostic subgroups of CLL (i.e., IGHV mutated and unmutated) and genomic methylation pattern. However, the relationship between DNA methylation and prognostic markers, such as the proliferation gene expression signature, has not been investigated in MCL. We applied high-resolution methylation microarrays (27,578 CpG sites) to assess the global DNA methylation profiles in 20 MCL (10 each with high/low proliferation signature) and 30 CLL (15 poor-prognostic IGHV unmutated subset #1 and 15 good-prognostic IGHV mutated subset #4) samples. Notably, MCL and each CLL subset displayed distinct genomic methylation profiles. After unsupervised hierarchical clustering, 17/20 MCL cases formed a cluster separate from CLL, while CLL subsets #1 and #4 formed subclusters. Surprisingly, few differentially methylated genes (n = 6) were identified between high vs. low proliferation MCL. In contrast, distinct methylation profiles were demonstrated for MCL and CLL. Importantly, certain functional classes of genes were preferentially methylated in either disease. For instance, developmental genes, in particular homeobox transcription factor genes (e.g., HLXB9, HOXA13), were more highly methylated in MCL, whereas apoptosis-related genes were enriched among targets methylated in CLL (e.g., CYFIP2, NR4A1). Results were validated using pyrosequencing, RQ-PCR and reexpression of specific genes. In summary, the methylation profile of MCL was homogeneous and no correlation with the proliferation signature was observed. Compared to CLL, however, marked differences were discovered such as the preferential methylation of homeobox genes in MCL.","['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Halldorsdottir, Anna Margret', 'Kanduri, Meena', 'Marincevic, Millaray', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Axelsson, Tomas', 'Agarwal, Prasoon', 'Jernberg-Wiklund, Helena', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Ehrencrona, Hans', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Halldorsdottir AM', 'Kanduri M', 'Marincevic M', 'Mansouri L', 'Isaksson A', 'Goransson H', 'Axelsson T', 'Agarwal P', 'Jernberg-Wiklund H', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Sander B', 'Ehrencrona H', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics, and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. annamha@landspitali.is']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20120228,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'CpG Islands/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2012/03/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23115 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Apr;87(4):361-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23115.

Highly active anti-retroviral therapy suppressed the viral load below detection threshold. INVESTIGATIONS: There were no contraindications for allogeneic HSCT. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Myeloablative conditioning consisted of total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide. Anti-thymocyte globulin, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for immunosuppression. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (nucleoside and nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, boostered protease inhibitor, maraviroc and raltegravir) was maintained for allogeneic HSCT and viral load remained below detection threshold. No graft-versus-host disease or serious infectious complications occurred. The patient showed good graft function with stable hematopoiesis. Localized Kaposi's sarcoma was diagnosed six months after allogeneic HSCT and treated successfully with surgical excision and reduction of immunosuppression. Almost one year after allogeneic HSCT, the CD4+ cell count is rising and viral load remains below detection threshold with combined anti-retroviral therapy.

METHODS: Expression level of PBX2 was immunohistochemically examined in 66 GSCC subjects (30 men and 36 women) with ages ranging from 42 to 85 (median 64.5) years, in which staining intensity in tumor cells was categorized as either weaker (level 1) or equal to/stronger (level 2) than that in the endothelial cells. RESULTS: PBX2 expression is correlated with valosin-containing protein (VCP) expression. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a high level of PBX2 expression to be a poor prognosticator for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and PBX2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS in GSCC.

Instead of continuing the consolidation therapy, maintenance therapy involving 8 rounds of ATRA monotherapy (45 mg/m(2), days1 approximately 14) was initiated.

The first signs of CDC appear during neutrophil recovery. Clinical and physiopathological characteristics of CDC suggest it belongs to the spectrum of fungus-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We report five cases of CDC treated with antifungal therapy and adjuvant corticosteroids to decrease the exacerbated inflammatory response. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in the Haematology Department of the University Hospital of Tours, France. The five reported cases were treated for CDC with antifungal therapy and adjuvant corticosteroids. RESULTS: Of the five cases of CDC, one was proven and four were possible, according to the 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification. All patients were being treated for acute leukaemia. In all cases, symptoms disappeared 2.8 days (range, 1-7) after the beginning of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids were administered on average for 146 days (range, 4 weeks-1 year) and antifungal therapy was administered for the duration of chemotherapy consolidation. There was no exacerbation of CDC symptoms during the next round of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. One patient died from relapse of leukaemia.

A substantial number of patients become drug resistant during chemotherapy, necessitating the development of alternative modes of treatment. rGel (recombinant Gelonin)/BlyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator) is a toxin-cytokine fusion protein used for selective killing of malignant B-cells expressing receptors for B-cell-activating factor (BAFF/BLyS) by receptor-targeted delivery of the toxin, Gelonin. Here, we demonstrate that rGel/BLyS binds to ALL cells expressing BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) and upon internalization, it induces apoptosis of these cells and causes downregulation of survival genes even in the presence of stromal protection. Using an immunodeficient transplant model for human ALL, we show that rGel/BLyS prolongs survival of both Philadelphia chromosome-positive and negative ALL-bearing mice. Furthermore, we used AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, to mobilize the leukemic cells protected in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and the combination with rGel/BLyS resulted in a significant reduction of the tumor load in the BM and complete eradication of ALL cells from the circulation.

Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow samples of ALL patients including 136 B- and 40 T-lineage ALL, and ETV6 fusion genes were detected by multiplex-nested RT-PCR. Changes of ETV6 fusion gene mRNA transcript levels were examined by real-time RT-PCR. We detected a total of 15 ETV6 gene rearrangements with a positive rate of 8.5%, involving seven ETV6-associated fusion genes in 13 B-ALL (13/136, 9.6%) and 2 T-ALL patients (2/40, 5.0%).

Among them, Matrix factorization (MF) is advantageous for clustering gene expression patterns from DNA microarray experiments, as it efficiently reduces the dimension of gene expression data. Although several MF methods have been proposed for clustering gene expression patterns, a systematic evaluation has not been reported yet. RESULTS: Here we evaluated the clustering performance of orthogonal and non-orthogonal MFs by a total of nine measurements for performance in four gene expression datasets and one well-known dataset for clustering. Specifically, we employed a non-orthogonal MF algorithm, BSNMF (Bi-directional Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization), that applies bi-directional sparseness constraints superimposed on non-negative constraints, comprising a few dominantly co-expressed genes and samples together. Non-orthogonal MFs tended to show better clustering-quality and prediction-accuracy indices than orthogonal MFs as well as a traditional method, K-means. Moreover, BSNMF showed improved performance in these measurements. Non-orthogonal MFs including BSNMF showed also good performance in the functional enrichment test using Gene Ontology terms and biological pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the clustering performance of orthogonal and non-orthogonal MFs was appropriately evaluated for clustering microarray data by comprehensive measurements. This study showed that non-orthogonal MFs have better performance than orthogonal MFs and K-means for clustering microarray data.",,"['Kim, Mi Hyeon', 'Seo, Hwa Jeong', 'Joung, Je-Gun', 'Kim, Ju Han']","['Kim MH', 'Seo HJ', 'Joung JG', 'Kim JH']","['Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics, Systems Biomedical Informatics Research Center, and Interdisciplinary Program of Medical Informatics Div. of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110799, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111130,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",2012/03/06 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/03/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-12-S13-S8 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-12-S13-S8 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2011;12 Suppl 13:S8. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-S13-S8.

We aim to solve this reproducibility problem by introducing a technique (SNet). SNet provides both quantitative and descriptive analysis of microarray datasets by identifying specific connected portions of pathways that are significant. We term such portions within pathways as ""subnetworks"". RESULTS: We tested SNet on independent datasets of several diseases, including childhood ALL, DMD and lung cancer. For each of these diseases, we obtained two independent microarray datasets produced by distinct labs on distinct platforms. In each case, our technique consistently produced almost the same list of significant nontrivial subnetworks from two independent sets of microarray data. The gene-level agreement of these significant subnetworks was between 51.18% to 93.01%. In contrast, when the same pairs of microarray datasets were analysed using GSEA, t-test and SAM, this percentage fell between 2.38% to 28.90% for GSEA, 49.60% tp 73.01% for t-test, and 49.96% to 81.25% for SAM. Furthermore, the genes selected using these existing methods did not form subnetworks of substantial size. Thus it is more probable that the subnetworks selected by our technique can provide the researcher with more descriptive information on the portions of the pathway actually affected by the disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly demonstrate that our technique generates significant subnetworks and genes that are more consistent and reproducible across datasets compared to the other popular methods available (GSEA, t-test and SAM). The large size of subnetworks which we generate indicates that they are generally more biologically significant (less likely to be spurious). In addition, we have chosen two sample subnetworks and validated them with references from biological literature.

The goal of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, response to treatment and prognosis of feline CLL. A multi-institutional retrospective study of 18 cats diagnosed with CLL between 2000 and 2010 was performed. CLL was defined as the presence of a mature lymphocytosis (>9000 lymphocytes microL(-1) ) and confirmation of an immunophenotypically monomorphic or clonal lymphoid population. Each patient was required to also have at least one of the two following criteria: (1) concurrent cytopenia of at least one cell line and/or (2) >15% mature lymphocytes in the bone marrow. Data on signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathologic features and response to treatment were reviewed. Median age of the cats at initial presentation was 12.5 years (range: 5-20 years). The most common presenting complaint was chronic weight loss, which was present in 8/18 (44%) cats. Sixteen of 18 (89%) cats were treated with chlorambucil and prednisolone; four of these cats also received vincristine. Two (11%) cats were treated with multi-agent injectable chemotherapy (L-CHOP, l-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone). Eighty-eight percent of cats evaluable for response achieved a complete (nine cats) or partial (six cats) remission. Median overall remission was 15.7 months (range: 1.3-22.8 months). The median overall survival in the 17 cats with follow-up data was 14.4 months (range: 0.9-25.3 months). Results of this study suggest that CLL affects older-aged cats and responds favourably to treatment with oral chlorambucil and prednisolone.",['(c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Campbell, M W', 'Hess, P R', 'Williams, L E']","['Campbell MW', 'Hess PR', 'Williams LE']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120228,England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/03/01 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2012/03/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5829.2011.00315.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2013 Dec;11(4):256-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5829.2011.00315.x.

Mastocytosis is further divided into different subtypes according to the sites of involvement, laboratory findings, and degree of organ impairment. Cutaneous mastocytosis is diagnosed in the presence of skin involvement and absence of extracutaneous disease, and is most commonly seen in the pediatric population. Systemic mastocytosis, the disease form most commonly seen in adults, is characterized by the presence of multifocal, compact (dense) mast cell aggregates in the bone marrow or other extracutaneous organs. The mast cells may display atypical, often spindle-shape morphology and/or aberrant CD2 and/or CD25 expression. Elevation of serum tryptase and/or presence of KIT D816V mutation are other common findings. Systemic mastocytosis is further divided into different subtypes based on a combination of clinical features and laboratory findings. Recent studies have indicated that CD30 is frequently expressed in aggressive systemic mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia but infrequently in indolent systemic mastocytosis, and may be a useful marker for distinguishing these subtypes of systemic mastocytosis from one another.

The major immunophenotypic markers used by the WHO 2008 to determine the lineage for these proliferations are myeloperoxidase, CD19, and cytoplasmic CD3. However, extensive immunophenotyping is necessary to confirm that the cells indeed belong to 2 different lineages or coexpress differentiation antigens of more than 1 lineage. Specific subsets of MPAL are defined by chromosomal anomalies such as the t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome BCR-ABL1 or involvement of the MLL gene on chromosome 11q23. Other MPAL are divided into B/myeloid NOS, T/myeloid NOS, B/T NOS, and B/T/myeloid NOS.

However, appropriate risk stratification and decisions regarding the intensity of therapy are influenced by additional clinical and laboratory testing that reflect the biology of the disease. Recent years have seen tremendous progress in uncovering genetic lesions that influence the biology of ALL. In recognition of these advances, the 2008 WHO classification incorporated the category of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with recurrent genetic abnormalities into the classification of precursor lymphoid neoplasms. Based on the knowledge available at the time, genetic lesions associated with distinct clinical features, immunophenotype, prognosis, or other unique biological characteristics were included in this category. Not surprisingly, significant novel genetic lesions that profoundly affect the biology of ALL have since been identified and will have a major impact on risk stratification and may ultimately be incorporated into future classification schemes. After establishing an initial diagnosis and treatment regimen, hematopathologists must also evaluate for minimal residual disease (MRD) to determine the need for additional intervention because MRD remains the most useful clinical indicator of disease progression and response to treatment. Doing so requires familiarity with not only morphology, but also flow cytometry and molecular genetics. Although not all of these applications are handled directly by the hematopathologist, it is our strong belief that meaningful involvement in patient care dictates that hematopathologists appreciate all aspects of ALL diagnosis and disease monitoring. This review covers the salient aspects of recent advances in the biology of ALL and evaluation of MRD, placing emphasis on how this information may ultimately be used to improve risk stratification and, as a result, patient outcomes.",,"['McGregor, Stephanie', 'McNeer, Jennifer', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep']","['McGregor S', 'McNeer J', 'Gurbuxani S']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'World Health Organization']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2012/03/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0740-2570(11)00098-0 [pii]', '10.1053/j.semdp.2011.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 2012 Feb;29(1):2-11. doi: 10.1053/j.semdp.2011.07.004.,,,,,PMC4273645,"['P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS648407'],,,,,,,

The underlying genetic changes involved in SCN evolution to AML are largely unknown. We obtained serial hematopoietic samples from an SCN patient who developed AML 17 years after the initiation of G-CSF treatment. Next- generation sequencing was performed to identify mutations during disease progression. In the AML phase, we found 12 acquired nonsynonymous mutations. Three of these, in CSF3R, LLGL2, and ZC3H18, co-occurred in a subpopulation of progenitor cells already in the early SCN phase. This population expanded over time, whereas clones harboring only CSF3R mutations disappeared from the BM. The other 9 mutations were only apparent in the AML cells and affected known AML-associated genes (RUNX1 and ASXL1) and chromatin remodelers (SUZ12 and EP300). In addition, a novel CSF3R mutation that conferred autonomous proliferation to myeloid progenitors was found. We conclude that progression from SCN to AML is a multistep process, with distinct mutations arising early during the SCN phase and others later in AML development.

We obtained TCRs via an in vitro priming approach in combination with CD137-mediated enrichment. Recipient lymphocytes expressing transgenic TCR revealed the specific tumor recognition pattern seen with the original T cells. Adoptive transfer experiments using a humanized xenograft mouse model resulted in significantly retarded solid tumor outgrowth, which was enhanced using IL-15-conditioned, TCR-transgenic effector memory cells. These cells also showed an increased potency to retard the outgrowth of disseminated AML, and this was further improved using CD8-enriched effector memory cells.

The current analysis included 118 patients with chronic-phase CML who had been pretreated with imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib, with a median follow-up of 28.5 months. In this subpopulation, major cytogenetic response was attained by 32% of patients; complete cytogenetic response was attained by 24%, including in one of 3 patients treated with 3 prior TKIs. Complete hematologic response was achieved/maintained in 73% of patients. On-treatment transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5 patients.

Our aim was to understand how pediatric oncologists manage parents' hope in practice and to evaluate how they address parents' needs. METHODS: Participants were 53 parents and 12 oncologists whom they consulted across six U.K. centers. We audio recorded consultations approximately 1-2, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis. Parents were interviewed after each consultation to elicit their perspectives on the consultation and clinical relationship. Transcripts of consultations and interviews were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Parents needed hope in order to function effectively in the face of despair, and all wanted the oncologists to help them be hopeful. Most parents focused hope on the short term. They therefore needed oncologists to be authoritative in taking responsibility for the child's long-term survival while cushioning parents from information about longer-term uncertainties and being positive in providing information about short-term progress. A few parents who could not fully trust their oncologist were unable to hope. CONCLUSION: Oncologists' pivotal role in sustaining hope was one that parents gave them. Most parents' ""faith"" in the oncologist allowed them to set aside, rather than deny, their fears about survival while investing their hopes in short-term milestones. Oncologists' behavior generally matched parents' needs, contradicting common criticisms of oncologists. Nevertheless, oncologists need to identify and address the difficulty that some parents have in fully trusting the oncologist and, consequently, being hopeful.",,"['Salmon, Peter', 'Hill, Jonathan', 'Ward, Joanne', 'Gravenhorst, Katja', 'Eden, Tim', 'Young, Bridget']","['Salmon P', 'Hill J', 'Ward J', 'Gravenhorst K', 'Eden T', 'Young B']","['Division of Clinical Psychology, University of Liverpool, Whelan Building, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, UK. psalmon@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120227,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Family', 'Humans', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Patients', 'Physicians/*ethics/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/02/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2011-0308 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0308 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2012;17(3):398-404. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0308.

Recent studies have shown that expression of Jak2V617F in the hematopoietic compartment causes marked expansion of erythroid progenitors and their transformation to cytokine-independence. To determine if erythroid progenitors are the target cells for induction and propagation of Jak2V617F-evoked myeloproliferative neoplasm, we used a conditional Jak2V617F knock-in mouse and an erythroid-lineage specific EpoRCre line. Erythroid-specific expression of heterozygous or homozygous Jak2V617F resulted in a polycythemia-like phenotype characterized by increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin, increased red blood cells, erythropoietin-independent erythroid colonies and splenomegaly. Transplantation of Jak2V617F-expressing erythroid progenitors from the diseased mice into secondary recipients could not propagate the disease. Our results suggest that erythroid lineage-restricted expression of Jak2V617F is sufficient to induce a polycythemia-like disease in a gene-dose dependent manner.

Mutations clustering to either the N- or C-terminal (N- and C-ter) portions of the protein have different consequences on the protein function. In familial cases, the N-ter form is inherited with patients exhibiting long latency period before the onset of overt disease, typically with the acquisition of a C-ter mutation. Despite the essential insights murine models provide the functional consequences of wild-type C/EBPalpha in human hematopoiesis and how different mutations are involved in AML development have received less attention. Our data underline the critical role of C/EBPalpha in human hematopoiesis and demonstrate that C/EBPalpha mutations (alone or in combination) are insufficient to convert normal human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells into leukemic-initiating cells, although individually each altered normal hematopoiesis.

METHODS: In total, 368 patients were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Overall, 247 patients (67%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). Of the 327 patients who were studied, 207 patients (63%) achieved a major molecular response (MMR), and 99 patients (30%) had undetectable breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene (BCR-ABL) levels at some time during therapy. The estimated 10-year survival rate was 68%, the progression-free survival rate was 67%, and the event-free survival rate was 51%. In multivariate analysis, age >/= 60 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, bone marrow basophils >/= 5%, any peripheral blasts, and clonal evolution were independent adverse factors for survival. The estimated 7-year survival rate according to the presence of no factors (n = 154), 1 or 2 factors (n = 190), or >/= 3 factors (n = 24) were 93%, 70%, and 25%, respectively (P < .01). Achieving an MMR, a CCyR, or a partial cytogenetic response at 12 months was associated with significantly better 10-year survival rate in a landmark analysis (10-year survival rate, 80%-90%) compared with achieving a minor cytogenetic response or a complete hematologic response (10-year survival rate, 55%-65%) or another response (10-year survival rate, 10%). In a landmark analysis that included imatinib response at 12 months, achieving a major cytogenetic response or better (hazard ratio, 0.12; P < .001) and achieving a complete hematologic response or a minor cytogenetic response (hazard ratio, 0.36; P = .003) were significant favorable prognostic factors.

There is growing evidence that senescence of stem cells (or stem cell aging) is closely associated with a variety of aging-related diseases such as tissue atrophy, degenerative diseases and onset of cancers. Alterations in the systemic environment during aging may trigger stress signaling in stem cells and reduce stem cell characteristics, resulting in loss of differentiation potential and defective self-renewal (referred to as mal-differentiation). Thus, it has been suggested that aging-related disorders such as retarded regeneration of damaged tissue and onset of cancer may result from the mal-differentiation of stem cells. In particular, many types of cancers such as leukemia, intestinal cancer, skin cancer and sarcoma have been shown to originate from adult stem cells after a variety of oncogenic challenges.

Clear evidence of the dose-dependent excess risk of three major types of leukemia (acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia [AML], and chronic myeloid leukemia) was found, especially in people exposed at young ages. Such leukemia risks were at their highest in the late 1950s, and declined gradually thereafter over the past 50 years. Findings from recent risk analyses, however, suggest the persistence of AML risk even after 1990, and evidence of increased risk of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) due to atomic bomb radiation has recently been shown. High-risk MDS and forms involving complex chromosomal aberrations were found to be much more frequent in people exposed to higher radiation doses.

The 9-mer dimer CopA3 (L-CopA3) had antibacterial activity and induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells via a caspase-independent pathway. In this study, all of amino acid sequences of L-CopA3 were modified to all D-form amino acids (D-CopA3) to develop a more effective antimicrobial peptide. We investigated whether D-CopA3 had antimicrobial activities against pathogenic microorganisms and proapoptotic effects in human leukemia cells (U937, Jurkat, and AML-2). The synthetic peptide D-CopA3 had antimicrobial activities against various pathogenic bacteria and yeast fungus with MIC values in the 4~64 microM range. Moreover, D-CopA3 caused cell growth inhibition, and increased the chromosomal DNA fragmentation and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL1-beta, transcripts in human leukemia cells.

The higher level of resolution of single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping may be used to find cryptic abnormalities and to precisely define the topographic features of the genomic lesions, allowing for more accurate clinical correlations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed high-density SNP-A karyotyping at diagnosis for a cohort of 1,155 clinically well-annotated patients with malignant myeloid disorders. results: We identified chromosome 5q deletions in 142 (12%) of 1,155 patients and uniparental disomy segments (UPD) in four (0.35%) of 1,155 patients. Patients with deletions involving the centromeric and telomeric extremes of 5q have a more aggressive disease phenotype and additional chromosomal lesions. Lesions not involving the centromeric or telomeric extremes of 5q are not exclusive to 5q- syndrome but can be associated with other less aggressive forms of MDS. In addition, larger 5q deletions are associated with either del(17p) or UPD17p. In 31 of 33 patients with del(5q) AML, either a deletion involving the centromeric and/or telomeric regions or heterozygous mutations in NPM1 or MAML1 located in 5q35 were present. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the extent of the affected region on 5q determines clinical characteristics that can be further modified by heterozygous mutations present in the telomeric extreme.",,"['Jerez, Andres', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Jankowska, Anna M', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Tiu, Ramon V', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Mohamedali, Azim M', 'Batista, Denise', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Jerez A', 'Gondek LP', 'Jankowska AM', 'Makishima H', 'Przychodzen B', 'Tiu RV', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Mohamedali AM', 'Batista D', 'Sekeres MA', 'McDevitt MA', 'Mufti GJ', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120227,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['Chromosome 5q Deletion Syndrome'],IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Macrocytic/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Distribution', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/06/15 06:00,['2012/02/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.36.1824 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.36.1824 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Apr 20;30(12):1343-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.36.1824.

Measuring biomarkers during therapy might help individualize treatment by immediately identifying cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with high-risk ALL were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin alone (n = 100; 75 analyzed) or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane (n = 105; 81 analyzed). Echocardiograms and serial serum measurements of cardiac troponin T (cTnT; cardiac injury biomarker), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; cardiomyopathy biomarker), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; inflammatory biomarker) were obtained before, during, and after treatment. RESULTS: cTnT levels were increased in 12% of children in the doxorubicin group and in 13% of the doxorubicin-dexrazoxane group before treatment but in 47% and 13%, respectively, after treatment (P = .005). NT-proBNP levels were increased in 89% of children in the doxorubicin group and in 92% of children in the doxorubicin-dexrazoxane group before treatment but in only 48% and 20%, respectively, after treatment (P = .07). The percentage of children with increased hsCRP levels did not differ between groups at any time. In the first 90 days of treatment, detectable increases in cTnT were associated with abnormally reduced left ventricular (LV) mass and LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness 4 years later (P < .01); increases in NT-proBNP were related to an abnormal LV thickness-to-dimension ratio, suggesting LV remodeling, 4 years later (P = .01). Increases in hsCRP were not associated with any echocardiographic variables. CONCLUSION: cTnT and NT-proBNP may hold promise as biomarkers of cardiotoxicity in children with high-risk ALL.

AREAS COVERED: This article summarizes recent achievements in the clinical activity and toxicity of rituximab in the treatment of patients with CLL. A literature search was conducted of the PubMed MEDLINE database for articles in English. Publications from 2000 through January 2012 were scrutinized. The search terms used were rituximab in conjunction with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or CLL. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of The American Society of Hematology, The European Hematology Association, and American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched manually.

The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and time trends of lymphoid malignancies. METHODS: A 15 (May 1st 1996-April 30th 2010) years study of all patients who had lymph node biopsy at the Department of Haematology and Pathology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. RESULTS: The 391 patients had a male preponderance (M:F; 1.6:1). An increase in the lymphoid malignant cases was noted from 95 cases in the first 5-year interval (1996-2000) to 179 cases in the last 5-year interval (2006-2010) giving an average increase of 84.0%. Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (61.1%) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (18.2%) were the most frequent followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloma with equal proportions of 9.0% each. A positive correlation with a significant linear trends was obtained (r=0.1949, p<0.0001). Geographic areas at risk were found mainly in patients residing in Delta State (67.0%) which is a major oil producing state and Edo State (30.4%) where the hospital is located, both in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria.

In an investigator-initiated phase II trial of OFA plus chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), OFA treatment promoted partial CLL B cell depletion that coincided with reduced complement titers. Remaining CLL B cells circulated with bound OFA and covalently bound complement breakdown product C3d, indicative of ongoing complement activation. Presumably, neither complement- nor effector cell-based mechanisms were sufficiently robust to clear these remaining B cells. Instead, almost all of the bound OFA and CD20 was removed from the cells, in accordance with previous clinical studies that demonstrated comparable loss of CD20 from B cells after treatment of CLL patients with rituximab. In vitro experiments with OFA and rituximab addressing these observations suggest that host effector mechanisms that support mAb-mediated lysis and tumor cell clearance are finite, and they can be saturated or exhausted at high B cell burdens, particularly at high mAb concentrations. Interestingly, only a fraction of available complement was required to kill cells with CD20 mAbs, and killing could be tuned by titrating the mAb concentration. Consequently, maximal B cell killing of an initial and secondary B cell challenge was achieved with intermediate mAb concentrations, whereas high concentrations promoted lower overall killing. Therefore, mAb therapies that rely substantially on effector mechanisms subject to exhaustion, including complement, may benefit from lower, more frequent dosing schemes optimized to sustain and maximize killing by cytotoxic immune effector systems.",,"['Beurskens, Frank J', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Farooqui, Mohammed', 'Beum, Paul V', 'Engelberts, Patrick', 'Mackus, Wendy J M', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Beurskens FJ', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Farooqui M', 'Beum PV', 'Engelberts P', 'Mackus WJ', 'Parren PW', 'Wiestner A', 'Taylor RP']","['Genmab, 3584 CM Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120224,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', '80295-50-7 (Complement C4b)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C3b/analysis', 'Complement C4b/analysis', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Opsonin Proteins/immunology', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/02/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1103693 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1103693 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Apr 1;188(7):3532-41. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1103693.

Whereas very high CRLF2 expression was found in 17.5% of cases, only 51.4% of high CRLF2 expressors had CRLF2 genomic lesions. The mechanism underlying elevated CRLF2 expression in cases lacking known genomic lesions remains to be determined. All CRLF2 genomic lesions and virtually all JAK mutations were found in high CRLF2 expressors, whereas IKZF1 deletions/mutations were distributed across the full cohort. In multivariate analyses, NCI risk group, MRD, high CRLF2 expression, and IKZF1 lesions were associated with relapse-free survival.

Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days but the FLT3 and downstream effectors remained suppressed.

To explore the impact of EGAM1C on the hallmarks of mouse ES cells, MG1.19 cells stably expressing EGAM1C at levels similar to those in blastocysts were established using an episomal expression system. In the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (+LIF), control transfectants with an empty vector formed flattened cell colonies, while Egam1c transfectants formed compacted colonies with increased E-CADHERIN expression. In Egam1c transfectants, the cellular contents of POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, TBX3, and NANOG increased. Cell growth was accelerated in an undifferentiated state sustained by LIF and in the course of differentiation. During clonal proliferation, EGAM1C stabilized the undifferentiated state. In adherent culture conditions, EGAM1C partly inhibited the progression of differentiation at least within a 4-day culture period in the presence of retinoic acid by preventing the downregulation of LIF signaling with a robust increase in TBX3 expression.

HL-60 leukaemia cells were treated with methanol extracts of different Scrophularia species leading to strong growth inhibition and high cell death rates. The expression of cell cycle regulators, oncogenes and cell death inducers was determined by Western blot analysis. Furthermore the effect of S. lucida was studied in an NF-kappaB reporter assay, and in a novel assay measuring 'circular chemo-repellent-induced defects' (CCID) in lymph endothelial monolayers that were induced by MCF-7 breast cancer spheroids. Methanol extracts of Scrophularia species exhibited strong anti-proliferative properties. S. floribunda extract inhibited G2/M- and later on S-phase and S. lucida inhibited S-phase and in both cases this was associated with the down-regulation of c-Myc expression. Extracts of S. floribunda and S. lucida led to necrosis and apoptosis, respectively. Furthermore, S. lucida, but not S. floribunda, effectively attenuated tumour cell intravasation through lymph endothelial cell monolayers, which correlated with the inhibition of NF-kappaB.

CASE: A previously well 12 year-old boy presented with new onset T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia associated with a high peripheral blood white cell count. Plasma biochemistry tests on a blood sample sent to the laboratory using a pneumatic tube system showed a high plasma potassium level of 16.6 mmol/l, with otherwise normal electrolytes and renal function. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was normal, with no changes suggestive of hyperkalaemia. Pseudohyperkalaemia was suspected, and further samples transported to the laboratory by foot showed normal plasma potassium levels. It was subsequently demonstrated that the pseudohyperkalemia was due to the lysis of leukaemic white cells during the transport of blood samples from the ward to the laboratory within the pneumatic tube system. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatricians caring for children with haematological malignancies need to be aware of this cause of pseudohyperkalaemia so that unnecessary treatment, including the commencement of acute dialysis, is avoided.

Here, we report a set of novel findings on the molecular mechanism. We found that Akt (also known as protein kinase B), a substrate of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), was phosphorylated in U937 cells nullified with p53 or Molt-4 cells artificially abrogated with p53 after US exposure. On the contrary, Akt phosphorylation was transiently down-regulated then recovered in Molt-4 cells harboring wild-type p53 in US-exposed cells, possibly due to a mutual regulation between p53 and Akt. Inhibition of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) or DNA-PK revealed that DNA-PK, rather than ATM, was preferentially involved in Akt phosphorylation and cell survival after US-exposure in all cell lines.

(Araceae) is a traditional herbal plant used for centuries to treat various allergic symptoms including asthma and bronchitis. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was focused to provide a pharmacological basis for the traditional use of Acorus calamus in allergic symptoms using the mast cell-dependent anaphylactic reactions in in vitro and in vivo models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viabilities were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) induced beta-hexosaminidase and interleukin (IL)-4 productions in IgE-sensitized rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells were measured by enzymatic assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction mouse model was implemented for in vivo studies. RESULTS: Hot water (HW), butylene glycol (BG), hexane (HE) and steam distilled (SD) extracts of Acorus calamus showed different cytoxicity levels evaluated in RBL-2H3 cells. Sub-toxic doses of HW extract suppressed the beta-hexosaminidase secretion and IL-4 production significantly and dose dependently in DNP-HSA induced IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells compared to other extracts of Acorus calamus. Further, in vivo studies also revealed that the HW extract significantly inhibited the PCA reaction in mouse compared to the normal control group. CONCLUSION: HW extract of Acorus calamus most effectively inhibited degranulation and IL-4 secretion in DNP-HSA-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells and also reduced the mast cell-mediated PCA reaction in mouse, providing a therapeutic evidence for its traditional use in ameliorating allergic reactions.",['Copyright (c) 2012.

Overexpression of miR-125b alone in mice causes a very aggressive, transplantable myeloid leukemia. Before leukemia, these mice do not display elevation of white blood cells in the spleen or bone marrow; rather, the hematopoietic compartment shows lineage-skewing, with myeloid cell numbers dramatically increased and B-cell numbers severely diminished. miR-125b exerts this effect by up-regulating the number of common myeloid progenitors while inhibiting development of pre-B cells. We applied a miR-125b sponge loss of function system in vivo to show that miR-125b physiologically regulates hematopoietic development. Investigating the mechanism by which miR-125b regulates hematopoiesis, we found that, among a panel of candidate targets, the mRNA for Lin28A, an induced pluripotent stem cell gene, was most repressed by miR-125b in mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Overexpressing Lin28A in the mouse hematopoietic system mimicked the phenotype observed on inhibiting miR-125b function, leading to a decrease in hematopoietic output. Relevant to the miR-125b overexpression phenotype, we also found that knockdown of Lin28A led to hematopoietic lineage-skewing, with increased myeloid and decreased B-cell numbers. Thus, the miR-125b target Lin28A is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and a primary target of miR-125b in the hematopoietic system.",,"['Chaudhuri, Aadel A', 'So, Alex Yick-Lun', 'Mehta, Arnav', 'Minisandram, Aarathi', 'Sinha, Nikita', 'Jonsson, Vanessa D', 'Rao, Dinesh S', ""O'Connell, Ryan M"", 'Baltimore, David']","['Chaudhuri AA', 'So AY', 'Mehta A', 'Minisandram A', 'Sinha N', 'Jonsson VD', 'Rao DS', ""O'Connell RM"", 'Baltimore D']","['Departments of Biology and Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120224,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Lin-28 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn125 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/02/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1200677109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1200677109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Mar 13;109(11):4233-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1200677109.

Recently, we developed a carbonate apatite-based nanocarrier system for effective intracellular delivery and release of DNA molecules, achieving very high level of transgene expression in both primary and cancer cells. Although its efficacy in human T leukemia cells is relatively poor, immobilization of fibronectin and/or chimeric E-cadherin-Fc on particle surface could enhance transgene delivery in presence of an actin filament disrupter. Here, we report for the first time that simultaneous stimulation of human T leukemia cells by a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, a Ca(2+) ionophore and an actin filament disrupter dramatically accelerated carbonate apatite-mediated transgene delivery in the cells, resulting in over 100-fold more efficacy than commcercially available lipofectamine.",['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We report that treatment of human microvascular endothelial cells with sodium selenate at a pharmacological dose (100 muM) enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of nuclear STAT3 on Y705 in response to IL-6-type cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), indicative of enhanced STAT3 activity. Accordingly, STAT3 nuclear binding to DNA was increased, as well as LIF-induced gene expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). CCL2 plays a key role in inflammatory processes associated with neuronal degenerative and vascular diseases. The enhancing action of selenate on LIF-induced STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation was replicated by vanadate and a specific inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 1 (PTP1B). Moreover, we observed that selenite, the cellular reduction bioproduct of selenate but not selenate itself, inhibited enzymatic activity of human recombinant PTP1B. Our findings support the conclusion that in human microvascular endothelial cells selenate has a vanadate-like effect in inhibiting PTP1B and enhancing proinflammatory STAT3 activation.

Subject #2 lost gene marking by 4 weeks and at 6 months succumbed to his infection. The two surviving subjects have normal blood count and bone marrow exam, with no evidence for clonal dominance of vector inserts. We conclude that gene therapy salvage treatment for severe infection unresponsive to conventional therapy can provide life-saving clinical benefit to CGD patients lacking a suitable donor. We are developing lentivectors for our next generation gene therapy of CGD. We are also exploring novel alternate approaches to gene therapy using zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene targeting of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from CGD patients.",['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Over the past few decades, retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of a number of inherited diseases and cancers. The earliest retrovirus vectors were based on simple oncogenic gammaretroviruses such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) which, when pseudotyped with envelope proteins from other viruses such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope protein (GALV) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), can efficiently introduce genes to a wide range of host cells. However, gammaretroviral vectors have the disadvantage that they are unable to efficiently transduce nondividing or slowly dividing cells. As a result, specific protocols have been developed to activate cells through the use of growth factors and cytokines. In the case of hematopoietic stem cells, activation has to be carefully controlled so that pluripotency is maintained. For many applications, gammaretroviral vectors are being superseded by lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) which has additional accessory proteins that enable integration in the absence of cell division. In addition, retroviral and lentiviral vector design has evolved to address a number of safety concerns. These include separate expression of the viral genes in trans to prevent recombination events leading to the generation of replication-competent viruses. Further, the development of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors reduces the potential for transactivation of neighboring genes and allows the incorporation of regulatory elements that may target gene expression more physiologically to particular cell types.",['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate the selectivity profile of thioxanthones as inhibitors of multidrug resistance (MDR), their interaction with other ABC transporters, which were found to have a strong correlation with multidrug resistance, such as multidrug resistant proteins 1 (MRP1), 2 (MRP2) and 3 (MRP3) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was also evaluated. The interaction of thioxanthones with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) together with the prediction of their binding conformations and metabolism sites was also investigated. METHODS: The UIC2 monoclonal antibody-labelling assay was performed using P-gp overexpressing leukemia cells, K562Dox, incubated with eight thioxanthonic derivatives, in order to confirm their P-gp inhibitory activity. A colorimetric-based ATPase assay using membrane vesicles from mammalian cells overexpressing a selected human ABC transporter protein (P-gp, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, or BCRP) was performed. To verify if some of the thioxanthonic derivatives were substrates or inhibitors of CYP3A4, a luciferin-based luminescence assay was performed. Finally, the in silico prediction of the most probable metabolism sites and docking studies of thioxanthones on CYP3A4 binding site were investigated. RESULTS: Thioxanthones interacted not only with P-gp but also with MRP and BCRP transporters. These compounds also interfere with CYP3A4 activity in vitro, in accordance with the in silico prediction. CONCLUSION: Thioxanthonic derivatives are multi-target compounds.

Patients were scheduled to receive imatinib 400 mg daily. Plasma imatinib concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In 481 evaluable patients, estimated 7-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at a median follow-up of 65 months were 93% and 87%, respectively. Because imatinib dosage was reduced in many patients due mainly to adverse events, subgroup analysis was performed according to the mean daily dose during the first 24 months of treatment: >/=360 mg (400-mg group; n = 294), 270-359 mg (300-mg group; n = 90) and <270 mg (200-mg group; n = 67). There were no significant differences in OS and EFS between the 300- and 400-mg groups; however, cumulative rates of complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses differed significantly between the two groups. There were no significant differences in mean imatinib trough levels between these two groups for the patients in whom trough levels had been measured. Survival and efficacy in the 200-mg group were markedly inferior to the former two groups. These results suggest that, although a daily dose of 400 mg imatinib is associated with better outcomes, 300 mg imatinib may be adequate for a considerable number of Japanese patients who are intolerant to 400 mg imatinib.

Depending on the cell type and stimulus, PI3K activation can promote different fates including proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. The diverse roles of PI3K signalling are well illustrated by studies of lymphocytes, the cells that mediate adaptive immunity. Genetic and pharmacological experiments have shown that PI3K activation regulates many steps in the development, activation and differentiation of both B- and T-cells. These findings have prompted the development of PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. PI3K activation, however, has both positive and negative roles in immune system activation. Consequently, although PI3K suppression can attenuate immune responses it can also enhance inflammation, disrupt peripheral tolerance and promote autoimmunity. An exciting discovery is that a selective inhibitor of the p110delta catalytic isoform of PI3K, CAL-101, achieves impressive clinical efficacy in certain B-cell malignancies. A model is emerging in which p110delta inhibition disrupts signals from the lymphoid microenvironment, leading to release of leukaemia and lymphoma cells from their protective niche.

However, some orphan drugs become top sellers for unclear reasons. We sought to evaluate the extent and cost of approved and unapproved uses of orphan drugs with the highest unit sales. METHODS: We assessed prescription patterns for four top-selling orphan drugs: lidocaine patch (Lidoderm) approved for post-herpetic neuralgia, modafinil (Provigil) approved for narcolepsy, cinacalcet (Sensipar) approved for hypercalcemia of parathyroid carcinoma, and imatinib (Gleevec) approved for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. We pooled patient-specific diagnosis and prescription data from two large US state pharmaceutical benefit programs for the elderly. We analyzed the number of new and total patients using each drug and patterns of reimbursement for approved and unapproved uses. For lidocaine patch, we subcategorized approved prescriptions into two subtypes of unapproved uses: neuropathic pain, for which some evidence of efficacy exists, and non-neuropathic pain. RESULTS: We found that prescriptions for lidocaine patch, modafinil, and cinacalcet associated with non-orphan diagnoses rose at substantially higher rates (average monthly increases in number of patients of 14.6, 1.45, and 1.58) than prescriptions associated with their orphan diagnoses (3.12, 0.24, and 0.03, respectively (p<0.001 for all)). By contrast, for imatinib, approved uses increased significantly over off-label (0.97 vs. 0.47 patients, p<0.001). Spending on off-label uses was highest for lidocaine patch and modafinil (>75%). Increases in lidocaine patch use for non-neuropathic pain far exceeded neuropathic pain (10.2 vs. 3.6 patients, p<0.001). DISCUSSION: In our sample, three of four top-selling orphan drugs were used more commonly for non-orphan indications. These orphan drugs treated common clinical symptoms (pain and fatigue) or laboratory abnormalities. We should continue to monitor orphan drug use after approval to identify products that come to be widely used for non-FDA approved indications, particularly those without adequate evidence of efficacy.",,"['Kesselheim, Aaron S', 'Myers, Jessica A', 'Solomon, Daniel H', 'Winkelmayer, Wolfgang C', 'Levin, Raisa', 'Avorn, Jerry']","['Kesselheim AS', 'Myers JA', 'Solomon DH', 'Winkelmayer WC', 'Levin R', 'Avorn J']","[""Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America. akesselheim@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20120221,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Prescription Drugs)', '98PI200987 (Lidocaine)', 'R3UK8X3U3D (Modafinil)', 'UAZ6V7728S (Cinacalcet)']",IM,"['Benzhydryl Compounds/economics/pharmacology', 'Cinacalcet', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', '*Drug Approval/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Lidocaine/economics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Modafinil', 'Naphthalenes/economics/pharmacology', 'Neuralgia/drug therapy', 'Off-Label Use/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Orphan Drug Production/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Prescription Drugs/economics', 'Public Health', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/02/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031894 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20861 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31894. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031894.

The present study indicated that DIM significantly induced apoptosis in U937 human leukemia cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. These events were also noted in other human leukemia cells (Jurkat and HL-60) and primary human leukemia cells (AML) but not in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. We also found that DIM-induced lethality is associated with caspases activation, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) down-regulation, p21(cip1/waf1) up-regulation, and Akt inactivation accompanied by c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Enforced activation of Akt by a constitutively active Akt construct prevented DIM-mediated caspase activation, Mcl-1 down-regulation, JNK activation, and apoptosis. Conversely, DIM lethality was potentiated by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic or genetic approaches attenuated DIM-induced caspases activation, Mcl-1 down-regulation, and apoptosis. Lastly, DIM inhibits tumor growth of mouse U937 xenograft, which was related to induction of apoptosis and inactivation of Akt, as well as activation of JNK.

While such effects are generally ascribed to increased engagement of oncogenic pathways downstream of Mer stimulation by its ligand, Gas6, Mer has not been characterized beyond the scope of its signaling activity. The present study explores Mer behavior following prolonged exposure to Gas6, a context similar to the Gas6-enriched microenvironment of the bone marrow, where a steady supply of ligand facilitates continuous engagement of Mer and likely sustains the presence of leukemic cells. Long-term Gas6 exposure induced production of a partially N-glycosylated form of Mer from newly synthesized stores of protein. Preferential expression of the partial Mer glycoform was associated with diminished levels of Mer on the cell surface and altered Mer localization within the nuclear-soluble and chromatin-bound fractions. The presence of Mer in the nucleus is a novel finding for this receptor, and the glycoform-specific preferences observed in each nuclear compartment suggest that glycosylation may influence Mer function within particular subcellular locales. Previous studies have established Mer as an attractive cancer biologic target, and understanding the complexity of its activity has important implications for potential strategies of Mer inhibition in leukemia therapy.

Multiple studies support that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has an important influence on leukemia progression. Given that the BM niche itself undergoes extensive functional changes during lifetime, we hypothesized that one mechanism for the age-associated increase in leukemia incidence might be that an aged niche promotes leukemia progression. The most frequent genetic alteration in AML is the t(8;21) translocation, resulting in the expression of the AML1-ETO fusion protein. Expression of the fusion protein in hematopoietic cells results in mice in a myeloproliferative disorder. Testing the role of the age of the niche on leukemia progression, we performed both transplantation and in vitro co-culture experiments. Aged animals transplanted with AML1-ETO positive HSCs presented with a significant increase in the frequency of AML-ETO positive early progenitor cells in BM as well as an increased immature myeloid cell load in blood compared to young recipients. These findings suggest that an aged BM microenvironment allows a relative better expansion of pre-leukemic stem and immature myeloid cells and thus imply that the aged microenvironment plays a role in the elevated incidence of age-associated leukemia.",,"['Vas, Virag', 'Wandhoff, Corinna', 'Dorr, Karin', 'Niebel, Anja', 'Geiger, Hartmut']","['Vas V', 'Wandhoff C', 'Dorr K', 'Niebel A', 'Geiger H']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergic Diseases, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120221,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Aging/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/02/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0031523 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20324 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31523. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0031523.

To investigate this association, we independently evaluated plasma samples from 4 patients with CFS reported by Lombardi, et al. to have XMRV infection and from 5 healthy controls reported to be XMRV uninfected. We also analyzed viral sequences obtained from supernatants of cell cultures found to contain XMRV after coculture with 9 clinical samples from 8 patients. A qPCR assay capable of distinguishing XMRV from endogenous MLVs showed that the viral sequences detected in the CFS patient plasma behaved like endogenous MLVs and not XMRV. Single-genome sequences (N = 89) from CFS patient plasma were indistinguishable from endogenous MLVs found in the mouse genome that are distinct from XMRV. By contrast, XMRV sequences were detected by qPCR in 2 of the 5 plasma samples from healthy controls (sequencing of the qPCR product confirmed XMRV not MLV). Single-genome sequences (N = 234) from the 9 culture supernatants reportedly positive for XMRV were indistinguishable from XMRV sequences obtained from 22Rv1 and XMRV-contaminated 293T cell-lines.

Available forms of therapy for this disease have not shown significant effects and patients rapidly develop resistance early on in therapy. These factors lead to the very poor prognosis observed with CMML patients, with median survival duration between 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. This study is therefore centered around evaluating the selective efficacy of a natural extract from dandelion roots, in inducing programmed cell death in aggressive and resistant CMML cell lines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To confirm the induction of programmed cell death in three human CMML cell lines, nuclear condensation and externalization of the phosphatidylserine, two main characteristics of apoptosis, were detected using Hoechst staining and annexin-V binding assay. The induction of another mode of cell death, autophagy, was determined using a monodansylcadaverine (MDC) stain, to detect the formation of autophagy vacuoles. The results from this study indicate that Dandelion Root Extract (DRE) is able to efficiently and selectively induce apoptosis and autophagy in these cell lines in a dose and time dependent manner, with no significant toxicity on non-cancerous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. More importantly, we observed early activation of initiator caspase-8, which led to mitochondrial destabilization and the induction of autophagy, suggesting that DRE acts through the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The inability of DRE to induce apoptosis in dominant-negative FADD cells, confirms the mechanism of action of DRE in in vitro models of CMML. CONCLUSION: The results from this study indicate that natural products, in particular Dandelion Root Extract, have great potential, as non-toxic and effective alternatives to conventional modes of chemotherapy available today.",,"['Ovadje, Pamela', 'Hamm, Caroline', 'Pandey, Siyaram']","['Ovadje P', 'Hamm C', 'Pandey S']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120217,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)']",IM,"['Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Plant Roots/*chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Taraxacum/*chemistry']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/02/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030604 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20725 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e30604. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030604.

Here we first show that spontaneous neutrophil constitutive PCD is regulated by cell concentrations. Using a proteomic approach, we identified the S100 A8/9 complex, which constitutes roughly 40% of cytosolic protein in neutrophils, as mediating this effect. We further demonstrate that it regulates cell survival via a signaling mechanism involving MEK-ERK via TLR4 and CD11B/CD18.

The gingival tissue is one site commonly involved either by leukemic infiltration or by inflammatory reactive hyperplasia, causing gingival enlargement. The gingival infiltration may also be present without gingival enlargement. Early recognition of clinical findings in the oral cavity leads to its timely diagnosis and management. Since biopsy is highly contraindicated, gingival fine needle aspiration cytology was performed to assess its diagnostic value in detecting gingival infiltration in acute leukemia patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients of acute leukemia received clinical and gingival cytological examination. The cases were diagnosed based on bone marrow aspiration findings and classified according to the French-American-British criteria. The absence or presence of intraoral findings was recorded. Site for gingival fine needle aspiration cytology was selected. RESULTS: Leukemic gingival infiltration was found to be more common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while the characteristic oral findings were seen more commonly in acute myeloblastic leukemia. All the eight cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that were positive for leukemic gingival infiltration showed no clinical evidence of gingival enlargement. In terms of leukemic gingival infiltration, L2 subtype was the only subtype involved, while M5 was more commonly involved than M4 subtype. Two cases of L2 subtype showed gingival enlargement due to local factors like plaque/calculus rather than due to leukemic infiltration.

However, the functional relationship between these two processes remains far from clear. Here, we demonstrate an autophagy-dependent mechanism of caspase-8 activation and initiation of the apoptotic cascade in response to SKI-I, a pan-sphingosine kinase inhibitor, and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. Autophagy is induced concomitantly with caspase-8 activation, which is responsible for initiation of the caspase cascade and the mitochondrial amplification loop that is required for full execution of apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagosome formation by depletion of Atg5 or Atg3 results in a marked suppression of caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. Although caspase-8 self-association depends on p62/SQSTM1, its self-processing requires the autophagosomal membrane. Caspase-8 forms a complex with Atg5 and colocalizes with LC3 and p62. Moreover, FADD, an adaptor protein for caspase-8 activation, associates with Atg5 on Atg16L- and LC3-positive autophagosomal membranes and loss of FADD suppresses cell death. Taken together, these results indicate that the autophagosomal membrane serves as a platform for an intracellular death-inducing signaling complex (iDISC) that recruits self-associated caspase-8 to initiate the caspase-8/-3 cascade.",,"['Young, Megan M', 'Takahashi, Yoshinori', 'Khan, Osman', 'Park, Sungman', 'Hori, Tsukasa', 'Yun, Jong', 'Sharma, Arun K', 'Amin, Shantu', 'Hu, Chang-Deng', 'Zhang, Jianke', 'Kester, Mark', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Young MM', 'Takahashi Y', 'Khan O', 'Park S', 'Hori T', 'Yun J', 'Sharma AK', 'Amin S', 'Hu CD', 'Zhang J', 'Kester M', 'Wang HG']","['Department of Pharmacology and Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120223,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Atg5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Fadd protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Lamp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0', ""(N'-((2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)methylene)-3-(2-naphthyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide"", ')', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Sqstm1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Atg3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Transport', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/06/07 06:00,['2012/02/25 06:00'],"['2012/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)53173-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.309104 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Apr 6;287(15):12455-68. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.309104.

The understanding of its gene expression regulation and molecular mechanisms still remains elusive. Started from experimentally verified T-ALL-related miRNAs and genes, we obtained 120 feed-forward loops (FFLs) among T-ALL-related genes, miRNAs and TFs through combining target prediction. Afterwards, a T-ALL miRNA and TF co-regulatory network was constructed, and its significance was tested by statistical methods. Four miRNAs in the miR-17-92 cluster and four important genes (CYLD, HOXA9, BCL2L11 and RUNX1) were found as hubs in the network. Particularly, we found that miR-19 was highly expressed in T-ALL patients and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-19 represses CYLD expression, while miR-19 inhibitor treatment induces CYLD protein expression and decreases NF-kappaB expression in the downstream signaling pathway. Thus, miR-19, CYLD and NF-kappaB form a regulatory FFL, which provides new clues for sustained activation of NF-kappaB in T-ALL. Taken together, we provided the first miRNA-TF co-regulatory network in T-ALL and proposed a model to demonstrate the roles of miR-19 and CYLD in the T-cell leukemogenesis.

We consider two randomization schemes for clinical trials that are commonly used to design studies comparing adaptive treatment strategies, namely, up-front randomization and sequential randomization. Up-front randomization is the classical method of randomization where patients are randomized at the beginning of the study to pre-specified treatment strategies. In sequentially randomized trials, patients are randomized sequentially to available treatment options over the duration of the therapy as they become eligible to receive subsequent treatments.

In this study, we used a deuterium substitution strategy to develop a class of novel chemicals based on dasatinib and found that these compounds maintain inhibition on c-Src activity and display anti-non-small cell lung cancer activity in vitro and in vivo. BRP800, one of these compounds, was chosen for further studies. BRP800 mainly displayed antiproliferative but not proapoptotic activity. Molecularly, BRP800 did not show significant effects on the expression of antiapoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl1, or on the activation of apoptotic enzymes, such as caspase-3, -8 or 9. However, BRP800 decreased expression of cell cycle promoting genes such as cyclins D1, D3, E, A and CDK4 and 6, and increased the expression of cell cycle negative regulators including p21, p27 and p53. Consistent with these findings, BRP800 arrested cells at the G0/G1 phase in a concentration-dependent manner, and the G0/G1 fraction was increased from 64% in control to 85% in BRP800-treated cells. We also evaluated the effects of BRP800 on NSCLC xenografts using H460 as a model in nude mice. Compared with the known NSCLC drug docetaxel, BRP800 displayed potent and similar antitumor activity but with less toxicity.

Mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) appears to be a particularly strong prognostic marker, but it is difficult to perform in a routine clinical laboratory. zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70) protein detected by flow cytometry is a strong surrogate marker of IGHV mutational status; however, it suffers from the lack of standardization. METHODS: We investigated whether ZAP-70 mRNA expression level can be a prognostic factor in CLL. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze ZAP-70 mRNA expression from 102 CLL patients. RESULTS: The expression of ZAP-70 mRNA was significantly associated with Binet stage (P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.003), ZAP-70 protein (P = 0.018), IGHV mutational status (P = 0.038), and cytogenetic abnormality of del(17p13) or del(11q22.3) (P = 0.037) in CLL patients. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for ZAP-70 mRNA and ZAP-70 protein, positive ZAP-70 mRNA (P = 0.006) was an adverse factor in determining the treatment free survival (TFS). In a multivariate Cox analysis of TFS, ZAP-70 mRNA is not ideal as an independent prognostic factor. However, ZAP-70 mRNA was statistically significant in predicting treatment response.

In the present study, the effect of PML targeting therapy with As(2)O(3) and cytarabine (Ara-C) on Daoy medulloblastoma cell proliferation was investigated. Daoy cells were pretreated with As(2)O(3) for 6 weeks. The As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were cultured in medium containing Ara-C and cell viability was examined. Next, the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were inoculated into the nude mouse brain and the effect of Ara-C on the tumor size was evaluated. A significant increase in chemosensitivity to Ara-C was observed in the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. PML and CCND1 (cyclin D1) protein expression of Daoy medulloblastoma cells was downregulated by As(2)O(3) treatment.

However, it is unknown whether HDMTX chemotherapy kills intestinal bacteria on a large scale, thus causing dysbacteriosis, which may in turn influence the progress or prognosis of leukemia. The aim of this study was to examine changes in intestinal flora in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with HDMTX chemotherapy. Bacterial DNA in stool from 36 healthy children and 36 ALL children were tested at A(260) with a spectrophotometer before and after HDMTX chemotherapy. The primers of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli were designed according to the 16SrRNA/DNA bacterial sequences. Bacteria were qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescent quantitative PCR, respectively. Our data showed that the total amount of flora in the stools of children with ALL was decreased by 29.6% compared with healthy children (P < 0.01). The total amount of flora in the stools of children with ALL on the third and seventh days after chemotherapy were 1496.5 +/- 577.1 and 1966.6 +/- 598.3 ng/muL, respectively, which was notably less than before chemotherapy (2436.3 +/- 768.6 ng/muL). The amount of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus and E. coli in the intestinal tract in the ALL group after chemotherapy had an apparent change, which decreased most clearly on the third day, and partially recovered on the seventh day after chemotherapy.

The term ""MF"" encompasses primary myelofibrosis (PMF) as well as 2 other phenotypically similar malignancies: post-polycythemia vera (PV) MF (PPV-MF) and post-essential thrombocythemia (ET) MF (PET-MF). The World Health Organization classification system for myeloid malignancies recognizes PMF, PV, ET, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as the ""classic"" myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk disease have a median survival of 6-15 years, in contrast to those with intermediate-2- or high-risk disease, which is associated with a considerably worse prognosis. Following transformation into (secondary) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the prognosis of MF is even worse, with a median survival of 3 months or less. Due to the heterogeneous nature of MF, the diagnosis and treatment of this malignancy can be challenging. At present, the only treatment that can be applied with curative intent is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), whereas no other specific therapies exist that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MF. Since most patients with MF appear not to be eligible for allogeneic SCT, patients are often treated by conventional ""older"" drugs such as androgens and hydroxyurea (HU; hydroxycarbamide), with the principal objective being palliation. Following the establishment of a causal role of a specific mutation in the Janus kinase type 2 (JAK2) gene, namely JAK2V617F, in the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs in 2005, many efforts have been directed towards the development of novel JAK2 (including JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors. Other investigative approaches include immunomodulatory agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, and others. Recently, the positive results of the first in class of the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, ruxolitinib (formerly INCB18242), from 2 large phase III studies were presented and are discussed herein.",,"['Gregory, Stephanie A', 'Mesa, Ruben A', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Shammo, Jamile M']","['Gregory SA', 'Mesa RA', 'Hoffman R', 'Shammo JM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Rush University Medical Center/Rush University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['Humans', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/*therapy']",2012/03/08 06:00,2012/04/26 06:00,['2012/02/25 06:00'],"['2012/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2011 Sep;9(9 Suppl 22):1-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients carrying a monoallelic CEBPA mutation (moCEBPA), however, show no different outcome compared to patients with wildtype CEBPA, and these mutations are frequently associated with mutated NPM1 or FLT3-ITD. So far, no molecular or clinical hallmark has been identified to prognostically distinguish moCEBPA patients from patients with wildtype CEBPA. Therefore, we used the data of 663 CN-AML patients treated within the AMLCG 1999 trial to explore the prognostic value of moCEBPA in the context of concomitant clinical and molecular markers (mutated NPM1, FLT3-ITD). Multiple Cox regression in 515 patients adjusting for all available potential confounders revealed that the NPM1 mutation modified the prognostic value of moCEBPA with respect to overall survival (OS, p = 0.017) and event-free survival (EFS, p = 0.011). MoCEBPA was beneficial in NPM1 mutated patients: adjusted OS-hazard ratio (HR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.63, p = 0.016; EFS-HR (95% CI) 0.16 (0.04-0.65), p = 0.010. In contrast, moCEBPA had no prognostic impact in patients with wildtype NPM1: OS-HR (95% CI) 1.08 (0.59-1.97), p = 0.804; EFS-HR (95% CI) 1.12 (0.64-1.96), p = 0.682. We found no prognostic effect modification for moCEBPA by FLT3-ITD. The presence of a moCEBPA mutation was shown to be associated with prolonged survival in NPM1 mutated CN-AML patients. Confirmation of these results in larger studies will clarify whether an additional moCEBPA mutation influences the risk stratification of patients with an NPM1 mutated/FLT3-ITD positive genotype.",,"['Dufour, Annika', 'Schneider, Friederike', 'Hoster, Eva', 'Benthaus, Tobias', 'Ksienzyk, Bianka', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Kakadia, Purvi M', 'Sauerland, Maria-Cristina', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Braess, Jan', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Dufour A', 'Schneider F', 'Hoster E', 'Benthaus T', 'Ksienzyk B', 'Schneider S', 'Kakadia PM', 'Sauerland MC', 'Berdel WE', 'Buchner T', 'Wormann B', 'Braess J', 'Subklewe M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Spiekermann K']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University of Munich-Grosshadern, Marchioninistr.15, 81377, Munich, Germany. annika.dufour@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120224,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2012/03/01 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/02/25 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1423-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jul;91(7):1051-63. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1423-4.

There is a desperate need for new therapies. The novel fluoropyrimidine, FdUMP[10], was highly active against both human AML cell lines, (IC(50) values, 3.4nM-21.5nM) and murine lines (IC(50) values, 123.8pM-131.4pM). In all cases, the IC(50) of FdUMP[10] was lower than for cytarabine and approximately 1000 times lower than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). FdUMP[10] remained effective against cells expressing the Flt3 internal tandem duplication, BCR-ABL, MN1, and an shRNA against p53. It had activity against patient samples at concentrations that did not affect normal hematopoietic cells. FdUMP[10] inhibited thymidylate synthase (TS) and trapped topoisomerase I cleavage complexes (Top1CCs), leading to DNA damage and apoptosis. All cell lines and nearly all primary AML samples examined expressed both TS and Top1.

A predisposition to cancer has been suggested but not quantified by case reports. The DBA Registry of North America (DBAR) is the largest established DBA patient cohort, with prospective follow-up since 1991. This report presents the first quantitative assessment of cancer incidence in DBA. Among 608 patients with 9458 person-years of follow-up, 15 solid tumors, 2 acute myeloid leukemias, and 2 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome were diagnosed at a median age of 41 years in patients who had not received a bone marrow transplant. Cancer incidence in DBA was significantly elevated. The observed-to- expected ratio for all cancers combined was 5.4 (P < .05); significant observed-to-expected ratios were 287 for myelodysplastic syndrome, 28 for acute myeloid leukemia, 36 for colon carcinoma, 33 for osteogenic sarcoma, and 12 for female genital cancers. The median survival was 56 years, and the cumulative incidence of solid tumor/leukemia was approximately 20% by age 46 years. As in Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita, DBA is both an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and a cancer predisposition syndrome; cancer risks appear lower in DBA than in Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita.

Bendamustine was originally synthesized in the former East German Democratic Republic in the 1960s. It was designed to have both alkylating and antimetabolite properties. The alkylating agent properties are similar to those seen with cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and melphalan, and the benzimidazole ring is similar to cladribine. Molecular analyses have revealed that bendamustine differs from other alkylating agents in its mechanism of action. Differences have been observed in regard to its effects on DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Moreover, bendamustine can induce cell death through both apoptotic and nonapoptotic pathways, thereby retaining activity even in cells without a functional apoptotic pathway. Bendamustine has demonstrated significant efficacy in patients with indolent lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including in patients with disease refractory to conventional alkylating agents and rituximab. The toxicity profile of bendamustine is also superior to that of conventional alkylating agents. Combination therapy with bendamustine and rituximab has demonstrated superior efficacy to a standard rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it is currently being compared against the standard first-line regimen in CLL: fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

Here, we characterize the activity of two novel, highly selective Syk inhibitors, PRT318 and P505-15, in assays that model CLL interactions with the microenvironment. PRT318 and P505-15 effectively antagonize CLL cell survival after BCR triggering and in nurse-like cell-co-cultures.

PRT318 and P505-15 furthermore inhibit Syk and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation after BCR triggering.

Treatment of these malignancies is made additionally complex due to the occurrence of related severe cytopenias and other side effects. New agents to treat NHL and CLL are currently in clinical development; many of these are targeted agents with the added benefit of not producing the same adverse events (such as hematologic toxicity) observed with older cytotoxic chemotherapies.

A lysine-less NOXA (NOXA-LL) mutant, which is not ubiquitinated, is degraded at a similar rate to wild-type NOXA. Myeloid cell leukemia 1, but not other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, stabilizes NOXA by interaction with the NOXA BH3 domain.

A NOXA-LL mutant, which is not ubiquitinated, also requires an intact 26S proteasome for degradation. Depletion of the 19S non-ATPase subunit, PSMD1 induces NOXA-dependent apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: LV remodeling after AMI results in poor cardiac performance leading to heart failure. Although it has been shown that JAK-STAT-activating cytokines prevent LV remodeling after AMI in animals, little is known about the role of SOCS3 in this process. METHODS: Cardiac-specific SOCS3 knockout mice (SOCS3-CKO) were generated and subjected to AMI induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. RESULTS: Although the initial infarct size after coronary occlusion measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was comparable between SOCS3-CKO and control mice, the infarct size 14 days after AMI was remarkably inhibited in SOCS3-CKO, indicating that progression of LV remodeling after AMI was prevented in SOCS3-CKO hearts. Prompt and marked up-regulations of multiple JAK-STAT-activating cytokines including leukemia inhibitory factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were observed within the heart following AMI. Cardiac-specific SOCS3 deletion enhanced multiple cardioprotective signaling pathways including STAT3, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, while inhibiting myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis as well as augmenting antioxidant expression. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced activation of cardioprotective signaling pathways by inhibiting myocardial SOCS3 expression prevented LV remodeling after AMI. Our data suggest that myocardial SOCS3 may be a key molecule in the development of LV remodeling after AMI.","['Copyright (c) 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

We evaluated t(9;22) translocation in 208 cases with ALL (294 tests), including 139 childhood and 69 adult cases by FISH technique using BCR/ABL extra signal (ES) probe. FISH signal patterns observed in pediatric ALL cases were as follows; Major-BCR/ABL (M-BCR/ABL) (1.4%), minor-BCR/ABL (m-BCR/ABL) (3.6%), trisomy 9 (4.3%), trisomy 22 (4.3%), trisomy or tetrasomy of both chromosomes 9 and 22 (2.9%), monosomy 9 (1.4%), monosomy 22 (0.7%), ABL gene amplification (1.4%), derivative chromosome 9 deletion (1.4%), and extra copies of the Philadelphia chromosome (1.4%).

Three types of ANKL cells were categorized according to their morphological features. Leukemic cells were below 20% in both peripheral blood and bone marrow of 11 patients. The clinical characteristics and prognoses of these 11 patients did not differ significantly from those of the others. As an initial therapy, l-asparaginase chemotherapy resulted in a better response. A total of six patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and two received autologous HSCT, with all in non-complete remission (CR). After HSCT, four with allogeneic and one with autologous HSCT reached CR. Median survival of all patients was 51 days. Median survival for the patients with and without HSCT were 266 and 36 days, respectively. A total of two patients with allogeneic HSCT were alive and in CR. All patients without HSCT died of ANKL. The use of L-asparaginase was indicated as a factor for longer survival (HR 0.33, 95% confidence interval; 0.13-0.83, P = 0.02).

HSC occurs mostly in patients after profound and prolonged neutropenia, which is more often seen in patients with acute haematological malignancies. The incidence of HSC ranges from 3% to 29% in patients suffering from Acute Leukaemia. However, it is now seen less frequently with the widespread use of antifungal agents as prophylaxis or as preemptive therapy. Early and adequate diagnosis and treatment of HSC are crucial, as treatment delays can negatively affect the prognosis of the underlying condition. The pathogenesis is not well understood, but it is believed that it may be due to an unbalanced adaptive immune response that leads to an exacerbated inflammatory reaction, resulting in an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome. In this context, new therapeutic approaches such as the use of adjuvant high-dose corticosteroids have been shown beneficial.

However, knowledge of the molecular factors that influence sensitivity and resistance remains limited. Herein, we developed and characterised an in vitro leukaemia model of resistance to the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439. Human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells, CCRF-CEM, were selected for resistance in 4 microM ZM447439. CEM/AKB4 cells showed no cross-resistance to tubulin-targeted and DNA-damaging agents, but were hypersensitive to an Aurora kinase A inhibitor. Sequencing revealed a mutation in the Aurora B kinase domain corresponding to a G160E amino acid substitution. Molecular modelling of drug binding in Aurora B containing this mutation suggested that resistance is mediated by the glutamate substitution preventing formation of an active drug-binding motif. Progression of resistance in the more highly selected CEM/AKB8 and CEM/AKB16 cells, derived sequentially from CEM/AKB4 in 8 and 16 microM ZM447439 respectively, was mediated by additional defects. These defects were independent of Aurora B and multi-drug resistance pathways and are associated with reduced apoptosis mostly likely due to reduced inhibition of the catalytic activity of aurora kinase B in the presence of drug. Our findings are important in the context of the use of these new targeted agents in treatment regimes against leukaemia and suggest resistance to therapy may arise through multiple independent mechanisms.",,"['Failes, Timothy W', 'Mitic, Gorjana', 'Abdel-Halim, Heba', ""Po'uha, Sela T"", 'Liu, Marjorie', 'Hibbs, David E', 'Kavallaris, Maria']","['Failes TW', 'Mitic G', 'Abdel-Halim H', ""Po'uha ST"", 'Liu M', 'Hibbs DE', 'Kavallaris M']","['Childrens Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centregh, University of New South Wales, Randwick, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120216,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0', '(4-(4-(N-benzoylamino)anilino)-6-methoxy-7-(3-(1-morpholino)propoxy)quinazoline)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Aurora Kinase A', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology']",2012/02/24 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0030734 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-03346 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e30734. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0030734.

To gain more insight into the mechanism underlying these deletions, we have studied the occurrence and nature of abnormalities in one of these genes, the B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1), in a large cohort of pediatric ALL cases. BTG1 was found to be exclusively affected by genomic deletions, which were detected in 65 out of 722 B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patient samples (9%), but not in 109 T-ALL cases. Eight different deletion sizes were identified, which all clustered at the telomeric site in a hotspot region within the second (and last) exon of the BTG1 gene, resulting in the expression of truncated BTG1 read-through transcripts. The presence of V(D)J recombination signal sequences at both sites of virtually all deletions strongly suggests illegitimate RAG1/RAG2-mediated recombination as the responsible mechanism. Moreover, high levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), which is known to tether the RAG enzyme complex to DNA, were found within the BTG1 gene body in BCP-ALL cells, but not T-ALL cells. BTG1 deletions were rarely found in hyperdiploid BCP-ALLs, but were predominant in other cytogenetic subgroups, including the ETV6-RUNX1 and BCR-ABL1 positive BCP-ALL subgroups. Through sensitive PCR-based screening, we identified multiple additional BTG1 deletions at the subclonal level in BCP-ALL, with equal cytogenetic distribution which, in some cases, grew out into the major clone at relapse. Taken together, our results indicate that BTG1 deletions may act as ""drivers"" of leukemogenesis in specific BCP-ALL subgroups, in which they can arise independently in multiple subclones at sites that are prone to aberrant RAG1/RAG2-mediated recombination events.

This effect has been largely attributed to transcriptional mechanisms that depend on the p53 tumour suppressor protein. The PML tumour suppressor was initially identified as a component of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). PML, a critical OIS mediator, is upregulated by oncogenic K-RAS in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate here that oncogenic K-RAS induces PML protein upregulation by activating the RAS/MEK1/mTOR/eIF4E pathway even in the absence of p53. Under these circumstances, PML mRNA is selectively associated to polysomes. Importantly, we find that the PML 5' untranslated mRNA region plays a key role in mediating PML protein upregulation and that its presence is essential for an efficient OIS response. These findings demonstrate that upregulation of PML translation plays a central role in oncogenic K-RAS-induced OIS.

Because histologically defined cancer subtypes have not been systematically evaluated, their risk was assessed among people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). METHODS: Analyses included 569,268 people with AIDS from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, a linkage of 15 US population-based HIV/AIDS and cancer registries during 1980 to 2007. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer risk in people with AIDS to the general population overall, and stratified by age, calendar period (a proxy of changing HIV therapies), and time since onset of AIDS (a proxy of immunosuppression). RESULTS: Sixteen individual cancer histologies or histology groupings manifested significantly elevated SIRs. Risks were most elevated for adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (SIR = 11.3), neoplasms of histiocytes and accessory lymphoid cells (SIR = 10.7), giant cell carcinoma (SIR = 7.51), and leukemia not otherwise specified (SIR = 6.69). SIRs ranged from 1.4 to 4.6 for spindle cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma, adnexal and skin appendage neoplasms, sarcoma not otherwise specified, spindle cell sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, mesothelioma, germ cell tumors, plasma cell tumors, immunoproliferative diseases, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloid leukemias. For several of these cancer subtypes, significant declines in SIRs were observed across calendar periods (consistent with decreasing risk with improved HIV therapies) or increase in SIRs with time since onset of AIDS (ie, prolonged immunosuppression). CONCLUSIONS: The elevated risk of certain cancer subtypes in people with AIDS may point to an etiologic role of immunosuppression or infection. Future studies are needed to further investigate these associations and evaluate candidate infectious agents.",['Copyright (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.'],"['Shiels, Meredith S', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Shiels MS', 'Engels EA']","['Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA. shielsms@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120222,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/immunology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2012/02/24 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27454 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Oct 1;118(19):4869-76. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27454.

Nilotinib is a potent and selective second-generation TKI, with confirmed efficacy and tolerability in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML. A phase I/II study was conducted in Japanese patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or relapsed/refractory Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thirty-four patients were treated with nilotinib for up to 36 months. Major cytogenetic response was achieved in 15/16 patients (93.8%) with chronic-phase CML within a median of approximately 3 months. Major molecular response was achieved in 13/16 patients (81.3%).

The dimensionality of these data was reduced by the unsupervised feature extraction pattern recognition technique of auto-associative neural networks. The clusters observed were compared with the groups obtained from the more conventional statistical approaches of hierarchical cluster analysis. It was observed that frozen and fresh cell line cultures gave very different pyrolysis mass spectra. When only the frozen animal cells were analysed by PyMS, auto-associative artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed to discriminate between them successfully. Furthermore, very similar classifications were observed when the same spectral data were analysed using hierarchical cluster analysis. We demonstrate that this approach can detect the contamination of cell lines with low numbers of bacteria and fungi; this approach could plausibly be extended for the rapid detection of mycoplasma infection in animal cell lines. The major advantages that PyMS offers over more conventional methods used to type cell lines and to screen for microbial infection, such as DNA fingerprinting, are its speed, sensitivity and the ability to analyse hundreds of samples per day. We conclude that the combination of PyMS and ANNs can provide a rapid and accurate discriminatory technique for the authentication of animal cell line cultures.",,"['Goodacre, R', 'Rischert, D J', 'Evans, P M', 'Kell, D B']","['Goodacre R', 'Rischert DJ', 'Evans PM', 'Kell DB']","['Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Wales, SY23 3DA, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales, U.K..']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['2012/02/24 06:00'],"['1995/11/21 00:00 [received]', '1996/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/BF00365346 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 1996 Jan;21(3):231-41. doi: 10.1007/BF00365346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COS-1 cells, which are most widely used for eukariotic gene expression, were transfected with human bcl-2 gene. Both bcl-2 and mock transfected COS-1 cells were cultured at low (0.2%) serum concentration for 9 days. The final viable cell number of the bcl-2 transfected cells was ninefold of that of the mock transfectants. Both bcl-2 and mock transfectants were further transfected with the vector pcDNA-lambda containing SV40 ori and immunoglobulin lambda gene for transiently expressing lambda protein. The bcl-2 expressing COS-1 cells produced more lambda protein than the mock transfected COS-1 cells after 4 days posttransfection.Mouse myeloma p3-X63-Ag.8.653 cells, which are widely used as the partner for preparing hybridoma, and hybridoma 2E3 cells were transfected with human bcl-2 gene. Both bcl-2 transfected myeloma and hybridoma survived longer than the corresponding original cells in batch culture. The bcl-2 transfected 2E3 cells survived 2 to 4 four days longer in culture, producing 1.5- to 4-fold amount of antibody in comparison with the mock transfectants.Coexpression of bag-1 with bcl-2 improved survival of hybridoma 2E3 cells more than bcl-2 expression alone. The bag-1 and bcl-2 coexpressing cells produced more IgG than the the cells expressing bcl-2 alone.Apoptosis of Friend murine erythroleukemia(F-MEL) cells was suppressed with antisense c-jun expression.
