Triethylene melamine may be administered orally with nitrogen mustard-like effects and is undergoing further trial. Aminopterin, ACTH and cortisone often cause short remissions in acute leukemia. Urethane is the best treatment available for multiple myeloma. Polycythemia vera is well controlled by radioactive phosphorus combined with venesection.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of As(2)O(3) in vitro at low concentration (0.25-2.0 micro M) on three human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines: HL-60, RL and K562. As(2)O(3) inhibited the growth of these cell lines significantly. During As(2)O(3) treatment, two forms of cell death, apoptosis in HL-60 and RL and oncosis in K562, were found by morphological study. In HL-60 and RL, cell cycle analysis showed, at a distinct SubG1 region, that CD95 and CD95 ligand (CD95L) expression was upregulated, caspase 8 and caspase 3 were activated, and Bcl-2 protein expression was downregulated. On the other hand, in K562, the cell cycle was arrested at the G2+M phase, CD95/CD95L expression was upregulated, caspase 8 and caspase 3 were activated, but Bcl-2 expression was not changed as compared with untreated cells. These findings suggest that the CD95/CD95L pathway is involved in cell killing by As(2)O(3). Using anti-CD95 IgG monoclonal antibody (anti-CD95 MoAb) or specific caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk to block the CD95 pathway, the cell death induced by As(2)O(3) was partially blocked in each cell line. These results suggest that As(2)O(3) inhibits the growth of these leukemia/lymphoma cell lines by inducing apoptosis or oncosis that is partially mediated by the CD95/CD95L pathway.","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan.']","['Copyright 2003 S.

The most common SMNs are central nervous system (CNS) tumors, sarcomas, thyroid and parotid gland carcinomas, and leukemia, particularly acute myeloblastic leukemia. Genetic predisposition, chemotherapy, and especially radiation therapy are implicated as pathogenic factors in SMN. All survivors of childhood cancer should have lifelong follow-up, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, which does not require ionizing radiation and provides greater anatomic detail and resolution in the head and neck region and the CNS. A new or progressive lesion may represent recurrence of the primitive neoplastic process, late radiation injury, or, more infrequently, an SMN. Differential diagnosis can be very difficult, and outcome is often fatal. Treatment protocols should be modified to reduce the risk for SMN without compromising the effectiveness of initial therapy. Clinicians should individualize treatment for patients who are genetically predisposed to SMN. In addition, radiologists should be familiar with the long-term consequences of antineoplastic therapy to facilitate diagnosis and anticipate adverse outcomes.","[""Department of Pediatric Radiology and Institut de Diagnostic per la Imatge, Hospital Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron, Psg Vall d'Hebron 112-119, Barcelona E-08035, Spain. evazquez@cs.vhebron.es""]","['Copyright RSNA, 2003']",52,,,,,,,,,,,

Highly specific quantitative, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays measured total GR transcripts, transcripts encoding the isoforms glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha) and glucocorticoid receptor beta (GRbeta), and transcripts containing different forms of exon 1: 1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1B, and 1C. GRalpha and GRbeta transcripts are coordinately upregulated in CEM-C7 cells and coordinately downregulated in IM-9 cells by dexamethasone. The concentration of GRalpha mRNA is more than a 1000-fold higher than that for GRbeta mRNA. Transcripts with different exon 1 forms are all upregulated in CEM-C7 cells and all downregulated in IM-9 cells by dexamethasone, but transcripts containing exons 1A1, 1A2, or 1A3 are regulated to a higher degree than transcripts containing exon 1B or exon 1C. However, exon 1B- and exon 1C-containing transcripts are substantially more abundant than exon 1A-containing transcripts, with exon 1A3-containing transcripts more abundant than exon 1A1- or exon 1A2-containing transcripts. Analysis using models for glucocorticoid receptor autoregulation kinetics suggests that the minor 1A3-containing transcript component could be important for GR protein upregulation, and hence apoptosis, in CEM-C7 cells. These studies suggest that GRalpha transcripts containing exons 1A3, 1B, and 1C contribute most to the intracellular level of GR mRNA and may be the most relevant for steroid-mediated apoptosis in T-lymphoblasts.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Stanley S.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mexico City and Leon, Guanajato, Mexico in 1997. The study population consisted of the parents of 51 children under 15 years of age diagnosed with leukemia, who were hospitalized for the first time in two IMSS hospitals. A questionnaire was applied to participants to obtain direct and indirect expenditures during that period. Consumer price indexes (1997-2002) were used to estimate expenditure prices for 2002. Average expenditures and catastrophic expenditures were estimated. Factors associated with expenditures were analyzed using a linear regression model in which the dependent variable was the total household expenditures during hospitalization. RESULTS: The average household cost per hospitalization was 7,318 pesos, 86% of which corresponded to medical care and 14% to indirect costs. Catastrophic expenditures occurred in 14% of households. In 47% of household expenditures exceeded 100% of the total household income during the hospitalization period. Expenditures during hospitalization were associated with place of residence, income level, and type of medical insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Being an IMSS policyholder decreased out-of-pocket expenditures, but not complementary expenditures, which may still be unaffordable for a large segment of the population. For more than a half of the households studied, continuity of care was compromised, as expenditures during the first hospitalization entailed using up savings, going into debt, and/or selling household property.","['Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

With intensive multidrug regimens, the majority of patients can now be cured. In the current study, the authors present what to their knowledge is the longest follow-up presented to date (median, 20 years for survivors) of the largest group of DLBL patients treated with a single protocol at a single institution. METHODS: Between 1971-1990, a total of 95 consecutive patients (age < 21 years) with DLBL were treated with the LSA(2)-L(2) protocol at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Patients with Stage I-II disease were treated for 2 years. In 1980, the protocol was modified and patients with Stage III and IV disease were treated for 3 years. In addition, before the modification, patients with Stage IV disease received a cumulative dose of 15,600 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide for 3 years; after 1980, these patients received the same dosage as the other patients (i.e., 8400 mg/m(2) for 2 years). Radiation therapy initially was administered to all patients with bulky disease in the primary tumor site. Until 1977, the dose of radiation was 20-55 grays (Gy); from 1977 to 1989, the dose was 20 Gy. After the fifth year of completion of treatment, all patients were evaluated comprehensively every 2 years. RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) of the patients was 79% with a median follow-up of 20 years. The overall event-free survival (EFS) was 75% (71 of 95 patients). Seventeen patients developed a disease recurrence and 15 died of disease. The OS and EFS rates for patients with Stages I-II disease (n = 8) were 87% and 87%, respectively, and the OS and EFS rates for patients with Stage III disease (n = 41) were 90% and 85%, respectively. The OS and EFS for patients with Stage IVA disease (with bone marrow [BM] involvement of < 25%) (n = 19) were 79% and 73%, respectively, whereas the OS and EFS for patients with Stage IVB disease (BM involvement of > 25%) (n = 27) were 74% and 70%. Of the 29 patients with Stage IV disease who were treated with the original protocol, 7 died of disease (1 of 8 patients with Stage IVA disease and 6 of 21 patients with Stage IVB disease). Of the 17 patients with Stage IV disease who were treated with the modified protocol, 3 died of disease (2 of 11 patients with Stage IVA disease and 1 of 6 patients with Stage IVB disease). Six patients developed secondary malignancies, four of whom died. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term EFS can be achieved in the majority of patients with widely disseminated pediatric DLBL. Chemotherapy alone appears to be sufficient prophylaxis against disease recurrence in the central nervous system. No disease-related or treatment-related deaths were reported to occur > 4.5 years after diagnosis in the current study.","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.

The authors examined internal tandem duplication (ITD) and Asp835 mutations of FLT3 in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) to determine the incidence of these mutations and to analyze the results for correlations with clinicohematologic features and outcome. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 107 patients with APL were analyzed. Isoforms of PML-RAR alpha were identified using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. A standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to detect FLT3/ITD mutations. Asp835 mutations were analyzed by PCR amplification of exon 20 followed by EcoRV digestion. All aberrant PCR products subsequently were sequenced. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had FLT3/ITD mutations: 9 of 63 patients with L-type PML/RAR alpha, 13 of 34 patients with S-type PML/RAR alpha, and 0 of 10 patients with V-type PML/RAR alpha (P = 0.005). The incidence of FLT3/ITD mutations was significantly higher in patients with S-type PML/RAR alpha than in patients with L-type PML/RAR alpha or V-type PML/RAR alpha. Twenty patients had Asp835 mutations (L-type PML/RAR alpha: n = 11; S-type PML/RAR alpha: n = 8; V-type PML/RAR alpha: n = 1). The frequency of Asp835 mutations was not significantly different among patients with different PML/RAR alpha isoforms (P = 0.582). Three patients had both ITD and Asp835 mutations. The microgranular variant (M3v) form of leukemia was found to be associated with a higher frequency of ITD (P = 0.002) but not with a higher frequency of Asp835 mutations (P = 1.000); analysis of clinicohematologic variables revealed no significant differences in FLT3 mutation incidence among other patient subgroups. There was no significant difference in complete remission rate, overall survival, or event-free survival between patients with ITDs and those without ITDs or between patients with Asp835 mutations and those without Asp835 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The current study found that ITD or Asp835 mutations of the FLT3 gene were present in 36.4% of patients with APL; however, these mutations had no prognostic impact. FLT3/ITD frequently was associated with S-type PML/RAR alpha and with the M3v form of leukemia.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. sly7012@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11636'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether this is related to an intrinsic worse disease biology or to inadequate drug delivery or excessive treatment-associated toxicity is unknown. The availability of imatinib mesylate, a selective, Bcr-Abl-targeted therapy that is administered orally with minimal side effects, may clarify whether older age would remain an adverse factor (thus, implying a different age-related CML biology). METHODS: Seven hundred forty-seven patients in different phases of Ph-positive CML who were treated with imatinib from 1999 until the time of last follow-up were evaluated. Among them, 187 patients had newly diagnosed, early chronic phase CML; 351 patients had chronic phase CML after interferon alpha (IFN) failure; 133 patients had accelerated phase CML; and 76 patients had blastic phase CML. The imatinib daily dose varied from 400 mg to 800 mg orally, according to the protocol design. Patients were categorized into a group of older patients (age 60 years or older) or younger patients (age younger than 60 years). Their characteristics, responses to therapy, and survival were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients had newly diagnosed CML, and 49 patients (26%) were in the older age group. Older patients had similar cytogenetic response rates and survival compared with younger patients. Among 351 patients with late chronic phase CML after IFN failure, 120 patients (34%) were in the older age group. Although the older patients had a lower incidence of achievement of complete cytogenetic response (Ph, 0%) by univariate analysis (56% vs. 44%; P = 0.05), age was not found to be an independent poor prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. Similarly, older age was not an adverse poor prognostic factor for survival. Forty-two of 133 patients (32%) with accelerated phase CML were older. The incidence of any cytogenetic response was lower in older patients (53% vs. 33%; P = 0.04), but age was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Older patients also had a trend toward worse survival (P = 0.09) that was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Twenty-eight of 76 patients (37%) evaluated in blastic phase were older. Older age was not a significant prognostic factor either for achieving response or for survival. CONCLUSIONS: With imatinib therapy, older age appears to have lost much of its prognostic relevance. This suggests that the previous poor prognosis observed with older age was related to treatment-associated factors (e.g., toxicity with allogeneic transplantation or with IFN therapy) rather than to an intrinsic, different disease biology of CML in older patients.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

A new molecular subtype named HTLV-IIc was further described on the basis of genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. This subtype is present in other areas of Brazil, indicating that the virus is additionally both a valuable marker for tracing past human migration routes in the Americas and a probable marker for social habits of the present human population. HIV, the other human retrovirus, is still not prevalent among indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon, but these groups are also easy targets for the virus.","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Centro de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem, PA, 66040-970, Brasil. rishak@ufpa.br']",,80,,,20030908,,,,,,,,

A total amount of 8.8 GBq (238 mCi) Re-186 HEDP was given to patient no. 1 and 14.3 GBq (387 mCi) Re-186 HEDP was given to patient no. 2. Re-186 HEDP activity was monitored based on its gamma radiation measurement daily for 5 days in patient no. 1 and 7 days in patient no. 2. Therapeutic Re-186 isotope distribution and biologic half-life correlated well with the prediction by a pretherapeutic Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate scan. The calculated effective Re-186 bone marrow dose was 3.3 Gy for patient no. 1 and 5.6 Gy for patient no. 2. Effective kidney doses were 1.6 Gy and 2.1 Gy respectively. No unexpected complications occurred after completing conditioning and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Posttransplant kidney function remained normal. Patient no. 1 remains in a second complete remission of his advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia 18 months after HEDP therapy. Patient no. 2 relapsed 5 months after transplantation and eventually died as a result of progressive disease. The authors conclude that Re-186 HEDP will be able to increase the total additional bone marrow dose. In patients in whom the kidney dose is limited to 5 Gy in addition to TBI, doses near 10 Gy can be achieved on the bone marrow.","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt, Main, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study shows that children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who are homozygous for the CCND1 A variant have a lower probability of event-free survival (P = 0.006) compared to carriers of the G variant. A significant result is retained in the presence of other prognostic factors.

To identify the true incidence of TMD in the Down syndrome population, a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective method of quantifying circulating megakaryoblasts in large numbers of patients was needed. In this pilot study, the authors tested the hypothesis that there are fewer than 1% megakaryoblasts of nucleated cells circulating in the blood of normosomic infants. Four-antigen flow cytometry was used to establish the percentage of megakaryoblasts present in each of 100 cord blood samples collected blindly from ""normosomic"" live births. There was a mean percentage of 0.017% megakaryoblasts in 100 cord blood samples from normosomic infants. Flow cytometry proved to be a sensitive, rapid, and reproducible method for the quantification of megakaryoblasts. Less than 1% of circulating nucleated cells in the blood of newborn infants are megakaryoblasts, providing a comparison population for the authors' larger proposed incidence study.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, KY 40536-0284, USA. sbay12@pop.uky.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viridans streptococci (VS) are a primary cause of infection and pneumonia in patients with neutropenia.

METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 172 patients treated on their institutional protocols AML91 (n = 95) and AML97 (n = 77) and identified 36 patients who had VS sepsis. RESULTS: The 1-year cumulative incidence of VS sepsis was significantly higher in AML97 than in AML91. Patients with favorable cytogenetic features (ie, t(9;11), t(8;21), or inv(16)) had a significantly higher incidence of infection than did other patients. VS sepsis developed at various times after chemotherapy was initiated, and patients remained febrile for a median of 15 days. Twelve patients (33%) experienced hypotension, 10 (28%) acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 6 (17%) fungal infection. Twenty-three patients (64%) required intensive care, 21 (58%), oxygen therapy, and 7 (19%), vasopressor medications. One patient died of pulmonary aspergillosis after VS sepsis. The 3-year cumulative incidence of aspergillosis was higher in patients with VS sepsis than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: Although antibiotic therapy rapidly resolved VS sepsis, complications associated with this infection remained life-threatening in children receiving chemotherapy for AML.","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",,25,['P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Potential mechanisms of methotrexate resistance include impaired drug uptake, decreased drug retention, and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) amplification. The purpose of this study was to assess whether reduced folate carrier (RFC) and DHFR expression in untreated leukemic blasts correlated with outcome. METHODS: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to measure RFC and DHFR mRNA expression in leukemic blasts from 40 newly diagnosed patients with ALL obtained in a blinded fashion from Children's Cancer Group studies. RESULTS: Low RFC expression at diagnosis correlated significantly with an unfavorable event free survival. Surprisingly, low, not high, DHFR expression correlated significantly with an unfavorable event-free survival. Proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression demonstrated a weak inverse relationship between sample PCNA and DHFR or RFC expression, suggesting that DHFR and RFC expression may be markers for factors other than drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that impaired transport may be an important mechanism of intrinsic methotrexate resistance in ALL, and DHFR expression also may be an important prognostic factor in ALL. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism for the correlation of low DHFR expression with poor outcome.","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",,,"['CA-09512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"[""Children's Cancer Group Study""]",,,,,,,

Treatment options for relapsed APL include chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia usually combined with ATRA or of other differentiating agents such as liposomal ATRA or synthetic retinoids. Presently, allogeneic peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for younger patients who have a histocompatible donor, as it gives the chance of cure in second or further relapse. For patients without a donor or for those who are not suitable for allogeneic transplantation, autologous stem cell or bone marrow transplantation may offer at least the possibility of a prolongation of remission, if the harvested cells are negative in the RT-PCR of PML/RAR alpha. Arsenic compounds have a high antileukemic effectiveness on APL cells. Arsenic trioxide has recently been approved for relapsed or refractory APL. With this drug, complete hematologic remission rates of 80-92% and long-lasting molecular remissions were achieved in relapsed patients.

CASE REPORT: We report a possibly cytarabine-induced acute pericarditis and pleuritis with a rapid onset. A patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia developed an isolated pericarditis 3 weeks after the first course of chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin. The second course of chemotherapy with cytarabine and amsacrine was started after clinical improvement; 3 days later an acute pericarditis with a large pericardial effusion accompanied by a left pleural effusion developed. A pericardio- and pleuracentesis was performed and the symptoms improved rapidly without reaccumulation of the fluid. The third course of chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and etoposide was completed without further cardiopulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis of pericarditis in the setting of chemotherapy with cytarabine should include cytarabine- induced pericarditis. The pathogenesis remains unclear, directly toxic and immunological mechanisms are suggested. Severe progression with massive pericardial effusion necessitating risky pericardiocentesis can occur and therefore a therapy with high-dose corticosteroids should be considered early.","['Abteilung Onkologie und Hamatologie, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, Switzerland. anita.gaehler@kssg.ch']","['Copyright 2003 S.

Deletions of the PURA gene are frequent in acute myeloid leukemia. Mice with targeted disruption of the PURA gene in both alleles appear normal at birth, but at 2 weeks of age, they develop neurological problems manifest by severe tremor and spontaneous seizures and they die by 4 weeks. There are severely lower numbers of neurons in regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum of PURA(-/-) mice versus those of age-matched +/+ littermates, and lamination of these regions is aberrant at time of death. Immunohistochemical analysis of MCM7, a protein marker for DNA replication, reveals a lack of proliferation of precursor cells in these regions in the PURA(-/-) mice. Levels of proliferation were also absent or low in several other tissues of the PURA(-/-) mice, including those of myeloid lineage, whereas those of PURA(+/-) mice were intermediate. Evaluation of brain sections indicates a reduction in myelin and glial fibrillary acidic protein labeling in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, respectively, indicating pathological development of these cells. At postnatal day 5, a critical time for cerebellar development, Puralpha and Cdk5 were both at peak levels in bodies and dendrites of Purkinje cells of PURA(+/+) mice, but both were absent in dendrites of PURA(-/-) mice. Puralpha and Cdk5 can be coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysates of PURA(+/+) mice. Immunohistochemical studies reveal a dramatic reduction in the level of both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated neurofilaments in dendrites of the Purkinje cell layer and of synapse formation in the hippocampus. Overall results are consistent with a role for Puralpha in developmentally timed DNA replication in specific cell types and also point to a newly emerging role in compartmentalized RNA transport and translation in neuronal dendrites.","['Center for Neurovirology and Cancer Biology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122, USA. kamel.khalili@temple.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine mitochondrial function in apoptotic cells, we applied high-resolution respirometry to human leukemia cells arrested in the G1- and S-phase by exposure to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and nucleotide analogue gemcitabine. At 30% apoptosis, opposite effects were observed on respiratory capacity (71% and 131% of controls, respectively). These changes correlated with alterations in cell size, cytosolic, and mitochondrial marker enzymes. Mitochondrial ATP production and membrane potential were maintained in all treatments, as deduced from high respiratory uncoupling control ratios (UCR). Bcl-2 over-expression did not prevent apoptosis after gemcitabine-treatment, but protected dexamethasone-treated cells from apoptosis, without fully preventing the decline of respiration and cell size. These results, therefore, provide conclusive evidence that alterations in respiratory capacity and enzyme activities per cell are mainly caused by opposite changes in cell size, occurring upon cell cycle arrest triggered by dexamethasone and gemcitabine in the early phase of apoptosis.","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Innrain 66, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that different cellular concentrations of PU.1 may direct distinct cell fates, with the highest concentrations of PU.1 required for macrophage development and lower concentrations for granulocytic and B-cell fate adoption. Since PU.1 transactivation activity is inhibited by the granulocytic factor, C/EBPalpha and the B-cell factor BSAP, high concentrations of PU.1 may be required for macrophage development in order to overcome the negative effects of alternative lineage specific factors. Lastly, PU.1 upregulation is implicated in the maturation of myeloid cells once they have committed to the macrophage and granulocytic lineages. PU.1 activity is inhibited in some cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), therefore, inhibition of PU.1 induced maturation may be a critical step in leukemogenesis.","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",,42,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The method of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used, the levels of WT1 gene's presentation in different types of montagers of MDS were analyzed, and the relationship between the level and the clinical characteristic was analyzed. At the same time, the expression of WT1 gene in AL patients, post-MDS-AL patients and normal controls were examined. RESULTS: The positive rate of WT1 gene expression in 49 patients with MDS was 22.4 percent (11/49), refractory anemia (RA) was 0(0/13), RA with excess of blast (RAEB) was 25.0 percent (6/24); RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) was 41.7 percent (5/12).

RESULT: The plasma soluble Apo-1/Fas levels in acute and chronic leukemia and multiple myeloma were significantly higher than those in normal controls (P <0.05). The plasma soluble Apo-1/Fas levels in chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were significantly higher than those in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, respectively (P <0.05). After chemotherapy, the plasma soluble Apo-1/Fas levels in complete remission group were distinctly decreased(P <0.05),whereas the levels in no remission and recurrence groups remained high. Compared with normal controls, the plasma soluble Apo-1/Fas levels in solid tumors were significantly increased (P <0.01), and the levels in metastasis cancers were significantly higher than those in non-metastasis cancer (P <0.0 1). Simultaneously the levels in remission cancer patients after operation and radiotherapy were distinctly lower than those before treatment(P <0.01), but were significantly increased in recurrence cancer patients (P <0.01). The soluble Apo-1/Fas levels in pleural and ascites fluid of malignant tumors were significantly higher than those in tuberculous effusions and transudates. CONCLUSION: The soluble Apo-1/Fas levels in plasma, pleural and ascites fluid of malignant tumor patients are markedly increased, which might be associated with the progress of cancers. The changes of soluble Apo-1/Fas levels may be useful for understanding the pathologic process of cancers and to differential diagnosis of various pleural and ascites fluids.","['The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diels (Danggui) on mice and the in vitro inhibitory effects of AP-0 and the sub-constituents (AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3) separated from AP-0 on invasion and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Three kinds of murine tumor models in vivo, sarcoma 180 (S180), leukemia L1210 and Ehrlich ascitic cancer (EAC) were employed to investigate the anti-tumor effects of AP-0. For each kind of tumor model, three experimental groups were respectively given AP-0 at doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg by ip once a day for 10 days. Positive control groups were respectively given Cy at a dose of 30 mg/kg for S180 and leukemia L1210, and 5-FU at a dose of 20 mg/kg for EAC. On d 11, mice bearing S180 were sacrificed and the masses of tumors, spleens and thymus weighed. The average living days of mice bearing EAC and of mice bearing L1210 were observed, and the rates of life prolongation of each treatment were calculated, respectively. The inhibitory effects of APs on hepatoma invasion and metastasis in vitro were investigated by employing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HHCC) with the Matrigel invasion chamber, adhesion to extracellular matrix and chemotatic migration tests, respectively. RESULTS: AP-0 had no obviously inhibitory effect on the growth of S180, but it could significantly decrease the thymus weights of the mice bearing S180. AP-0 could significantly reduce the production of ascitic liquids and prolong the life of mice bearing EAC. AP-0 could also increase the survival time of mice bearing L1210. AP-0 and AP-2 had significantly inhibitory effects on the invasion of HHCC into the Matrigel reconstituted basement membrane with the inhibitory rates of 56.4 % and 68.3 %, respectively. AP-0, AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3 could influence the adhesion of HHCC to extracellular matrix proteins (Matrigel and fibronectin) at different degrees, among them only AP-3 had significant blocking effect on the adhesion of HHCC to fibronectin with an inhibitory rate of 30.3 %. AP-0, AP-1 and AP-3 could partially inhibit the chemotactic migration abilities of HHCC. CONCLUSION: The experimental findings suggest that the total polysaccharide of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Chinese Danggui) possesses anti-tumor effects on experimental tumor models in vivo and inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.","[""School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiantong University, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify better predictive markers of clinical behavior in ALL, we have developed an integrated approach for gene expression profiling that couples suppression subtractive hybridization, concatenated cDNA sequencing, and reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR. Using this approach, a total of 600 differentially expressed genes were identified between t(4;11) ALL and pre-B ALL with no determinant chromosomal translocation. The expression of 67 genes was analyzed in different cytogenetic ALL subgroups and B lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors. Three genes, BACH1, TP53BPL, and H2B/S, were consistently expressed as a significant cluster associated with the low-risk ALL subgroups. A total of 42 genes were differentially expressed in ALL vs normal B lymphocytes, with no specific association with any particular ALL subgroups. The remaining 22 genes were part of a specific expression profile associated with the hyperdiploid, t(12;21), or t(4;11) subgroups.

In order to identify tumour characteristics that improve the understanding of biology of MCL, analysis of oligonucleotide microarrays were used to define specific gene expression profiles. Biopsy samples of MCL cases were compared to reactive lymphoid tissue. Among genes differentially expressed in MCL were genes that are involved in the regulation of proliferation, cell signalling, adhesion and homing. Furthermore, some genes with previously unknown function, such as C11orf32, C2orf10, TBC1D9 and ABCA6 were found to be differentially expressed in MCL compared to reactive lymphoid tissue. Of special interest was the high expression of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) gene in all MCL cases analysed. These results were further confirmed at the cellular and protein level by immunocytochemical staining and immunoblotting of MCL cells. Furthermore, there was a reduced expression of a regulator of G protein signalling, RGS13 in all MCLs, with a complete absence in the majority of cases while present in control lymphoid tissue. These results were further confirmed by PCR. Sequencing of the RGS13 gene revealed changes suggesting polymorphisms, indicating that downregulation of the expression of RGS13 is not related to mutations, but may serve as a new specific marker for MCL. Moreover, comparison between individual cases of MCL, revealed that the CCND1 gene appears to be differently expressed in MCL cases with high vs low proliferative activity.","['Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated this allochimerism approach in murine marrow transplants with different degrees of major histocompatibility complexe (MHC) mismatching; these include: (1) H2-mismatched transplant H2Kk to H2Kb, (2) full haplo-identical transplant H2Kbd to H2Kbk, (3) a partial haplo-identical transplant H2Kd to H2Kbd and (4) an MHC class II mismatch. Levels of chimerism increased up to 12 weeks and then stayed relatively stable up to 1 year after transplant. At 18 weeks post-transplant, the H2-mismatched, haplo-identical, partial haplo-identical and class II-mismatch transplants evidenced 17.9+/-4.4, 40.7+/-0.9, 25.1+/-4.19 and 33.7+/-3.5% donor chimerism, respectively. Dropping the anti-CD40 antibody treatment and spleen cells or changing the schedule of antibody to one injection, in haplo-identical or full-mismatched transplants resulted in no donor-derived chimerism. On the other hand, these still resulted in minor chimerism in class II-mismatched transplants. Lineage analysis of peripheral blood at 6 and 12 months post-transplant demonstrated a significant shift toward increased chimeric lymphocytes and decreased chimeric granulocytes in the full H2 as compared with haplo-identical or class II transplants. Transplantation with anti-CD40L antibody eliminated both graft-versus-leukemia and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and delayed lymphocyte infusion did not rescue animals from fatal leukemia. In conclusion, under the conditions of our tolerization regimen, a haplo transplant gives higher engraftment levels than a full H2 mismatch, and despite lower engraftment levels, a class II-mismatched transplant can be successfully accomplished with only 100 cGy and no CD40L blockade.","['Department of Research, Roger Williams Medical Center, Providence, RI 02908, USA.']",,,"['P01-DK-5022/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HL-56920/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-49650/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK2742/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective review of patients with ALL who underwent matched related allogeneic BMT was carried out to examine whether the rate of lymphocyte recovery after transplantation had any prognostic value in ALL. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at days 21 and 30 after transplantation was obtained for 43 patients who received transplants during an 18-year period. Patients with an ALC of 175 x 10(6)/l or less on day 21 were more likely to relapse than those with ALC greater than 175 x 10(6)/l (relative risk, 4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-11.2). Patients with slower lymphocyte recovery had significantly lower relapse-free survival than those with faster recovery (P=0.0028). There was also a trend toward poorer overall survival among those with a slow lymphocyte recovery (log-rank test; P=0.028). The rate of lymphocyte recovery is prognostic in patients with ALL undergoing allogeneic BMT, and this should be integrated with other predictors to identify patients at high risk of relapse. Such patients could be considered for interventions aimed at prevention of relapse, including rapid withdrawal of immunosuppressive medication or donor lymphocyte infusion.","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using rapid amplification of cDNA end, we identified the partner gene at 12q13, HOXC11. Molecular analysis showed that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to exon 2 of HOXC11 in all three cases with t(11;12)(p15;q13). Therefore, this type of fusion may represent the major form of the NUP98-HOXC11 chimera so far reported. Moreover, two out of three cases had a confirmed deletion of the 3' part of NUP98 gene and more telomeric region of 11p harboring a group of tumor-suppressor genes. Interestingly, the NUP98-HOXC11 protein when assayed in a GAL4 reporter system, showed an aberrant trans-regulatory activity as compared to the wild-type HOXC11 in both COS-7 and HL-60 cells. Therefore, NUP98-HOXC11 may contribute to the leukemogenesis by interfering with the cellular mechanism of transcriptional regulation.","[""State Key Lab for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis showed that oligoclonality of IGH, IGK, and TCRD was interrelated, that is, oligoclonality in one locus was related with a higher chance of oligoclonality in another locus. Combined Southern blot and PCR analysis revealed that Ig/TCR patterns were age related: children younger than 3 years or older than 10 years showed a higher prevalence of incomplete IGH rearrangements and a lower prevalence of IGK deletions, TCRG rearrangements, and TCRD rearrangements than children between 3 and 10 years. In addition, IGH oligoclonality was more frequent in the younger and older children. These age-related differences probably reflect ALL subsets with different cellular origin and differences in the duration of the preleukemic phase between the initial and final leukemogenetic hit. The more immature Ig/TCR gene rearrangement pattern in children younger than 3 years or older than 10 years resulted in relatively low numbers of potential MRD-PCR targets per patient, particularly if only monoclonal rearrangements were taken into account. These data provide insight into the immunobiological characteristics of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements in childhood precursor-B-ALL and form a useful basis for designing improved strategies for the identification and selection of MRD-PCR targets.","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, tumor cells frequently display multiple alterations in signal transduction pathways leading to either cell survival or apoptosis. In mammals, the pathway based on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt conveys survival signals of extreme importance and its downregulation, by means of pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, considerably lowers resistance to various types of therapy in solid tumors. We recently described an HL60 leukemia cell clone (HL60AR cells) with a constitutively active PI3K/Akt pathway. These cells were resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Treatment with two pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and Ly294002, restored sensitivity of HL60AR cells to the aforementioned treatments. However, these inhibitors have some drawbacks that may severely limit or impede their clinical use. Here, we have tested whether or not a new selective Akt inhibitor, 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (Akt inhibitor), was as effective as Ly294002 in lowering the sensitivity threshold of HL60 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, TRAIL, ATRA, and ionizing radiation. Our findings demonstrate that, at a concentration which does not affect PI3K activity, the Akt inhibitor markedly reduced resistance of HL60AR cells to etoposide, cytarabine, TRAIL, ATRA, and ionizing radiation. This effect was likely achieved through downregulation of expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as c-IAP1, c-IAP2, cFLIP(L), and of Bad phosphorylation on Ser 136. The Akt inhibitor did not influence PTEN activity. At variance with Ly294002, the Akt inhibitor did not negatively affect phosphorylation of protein kinase C-zeta and it was less effective in downregulating p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) activity. The Akt inhibitor increased sensitivity to apoptotic inducers of K562 and U937, but not of MOLT-4, leukemia cells. Overall, our results indicate that selective Akt pharmacological inhibitors might be used in the future for enhancing the sensitivity of leukemia cells to therapeutic treatments that induce apoptosis or for overcoming resistance to these treatments.","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia, Cell Signalling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to induce downmodulation of MEK-ERK activation in AML primary blasts in order to detect the effect on cell cycle progression and on the apoptosis of leukemic cells. We investigated 14 cases of AML with high ERK 1/2 activity and four cases with undetectable or very low activity. After 24 h incubation of the AML blasts with high ERK activity using PD98059 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA, USA), a selective inhibitor of MEK1 phosphorylation, at concentrations of 20 and 40 microM, we observed a strong decrease in the levels of ERK1/2 activity. A significant decrease of blast cell proliferation compared with untreated controls was found. In contrast, the proliferation of blast cells that expressed low or undetectable levels of ERK activity was not inhibited. Time-course analysis demonstrated that the downmodulation of MEK1/2, ERK1 and ERK2 dual-phosphorylation was evident even after 3 h of treatment with 20 and 40 microM. The cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an early sign of apoptosis, appeared after 18 h of PD98059 treatment at concentrations of 20 and 40 microM in eight of the 14 cases. After 24 h of treatment, cleaved PARP appeared in all 14 cases. Time-course analysis of cell cycle progression and apoptosis showed that PD98059 induced a G1-phase accumulation with low or undetectable levels of apoptosis after 24 h incubation; after 48 and 72 h incubation, a significant increase of apoptosis was observed. Thus, the primary effect of ERK downmodulation was a cell cycle arrest followed by the apoptosis of a significant percentage of the leukemic blasts. The preclinical model of leukemia treatment reported in this paper makes further comment with regard to MEK1 inhibition as a useful antileukemic target, and encourages the conducting of in vivo studies and clinical investigations.","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Section of Hemato-Oncology, University of Parma Medical School, Parma, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effects of Raf, MEK, and PI3K inhibitors on conditionally transformed hematopoietic cells were examined to determine if they would display cytotoxic differences between cytokine- and oncogene-mediated proliferation, and whether inhibition of both pathways was a more effective means to induce apoptosis. In the hematopoietic model system employed, proliferation was conditional and occurred when either interleukin-3 (IL-3) or the estrogen receptor antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT), which activates the conditional oncoprotein (DeltaRaf:ER), were provided. Thus, upon the addition of the signal transduction inhibitors and either IL-3 or 4HT, the effects of these drugs were examined in the same cell under 'cytokine-' and 'oncoprotein' -mediated growth conditions avoiding genetic and differentiation stage heterogeneity. At drug concentrations around the reported IC(50) for the Raf inhibitor L-779,450, it suppressed DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis in hematopoietic FDC-P1 cells transformed to grow in response to either Raf-1 or A-Raf (FD/DeltaRaf-1:ER and FD/DeltaA-Raf:ER), but it displayed less effects on DNA synthesis and apoptosis when the cells were cultured in IL-3. This Raf inhibitor was less effective on B-Raf- or MEK1-responsive cells, demonstrating the specificity of this drug. MEK inhibitors also suppressed DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis in Raf-responsive cells and the effects were more significant on Raf-responsive compared to cytokine-mediated growth. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 suppressed Raf-mediated growth, indicating that part of the long-term proliferative effects mediated by Raf are PI3K dependent. Simultaneous inhibition of both Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways proved a more efficient means to suppress DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis at lower drug concentrations.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville 27858, USA.']",,,['CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Leukemia. 2003 Sep;17(9):1759-61.

The principal observations made by gene targeting studies in mice are reviewed, with an emphasis on how a disruption of this pathway in vivo can affect blood cell development and immune homeostasis. We overview genetic alterations that lead to impaired TGF-beta signaling in hematopoietic neoplasms, including the suppression of Smad-dependent transcriptional responses by oncoproteins such as Tax and Evi-1, and fusion proteins such as AML1/ETO. We also consider mutations in genes encoding components of the core cell cycle machinery, such as p27(Kip1) and p15(INK4A), and emphasize their impact on the ability of TGF-beta to induce G1 arrest. The implications of these observations are discussed, and opinions regarding important directions for future research on TGF-beta in hematopoiesis are provided.","['Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,106,,,,,,,,,,,

PML/RARalpha expression blocks terminal myeloid differentiation in APL. Treatment with pharmacological RA dosages overcomes the dominant-negative effects of PML/RARalpha to activate transcription of retinoid target genes. This regulation is linked directly to RA effects in APL, including PML/RARalpha degradation and induction of differentiation. Identifying retinoid target genes is an important step in developing a mechanistic understanding of RA effects in APL. RA target genes have been uncovered through the use of molecular genetic approaches as well as unique cellular and transgenic APL models. Recent developments in the proteomic and functional genomic fields are providing useful tools for elucidating mechanisms of RA response or resistance in APL. These target genes represent potential therapeutic targets in APL and other retinoid-responsive diseases.

The velocity of Bcr-Abl increases predicted response duration in PB (cutoff: 1.25 log/30 days) and BM (0.6). Bcr-Abl level and velocity of increase in BM as well as magnitude of increase in PB correlated with remaining periods of survival and predicted relapse within 2 months in nine of 10, 10 of 11 and four of four patients, respectively.

Imatinib mesylate is a specific inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl kinase and has shown promising results in clinical studies. The structural relation between the Bcr-Abl oncogene and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has recently been elucidated by an elegant crystal structure analysis, emphasizing the importance of dephosphorylated tyrosine 393 (Tyr393) in Bcr-Abl for access of the inhibitor to the kinase domain. By mutating this tyrosine to phenylalanine and thereby mimicking a constitutively dephosphorylated state, we now show that Ba/F3 cells transformed by this mutant demonstrate an increased sensitivity towards imatinib in vivo. This effect is not due to an impaired kinase activity of Bcr-Abl Y393F, since a synthetic substrate is phosphorylated with similar kinetics. Treatment of Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl wild type with a phosphatase inhibitor diminished the effect of imatinib, but did not influence the growth of Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-AblY393F. The results support the findings of the crystal structure and indicate that Tyr393 indeed plays a significant role for the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl towards imatinib in vivo. These data implicate the regulation of Tyr393 phosphorylation as a potential mechanism of imatinib resistance.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine levels of residual disease in patients with MCR using various molecular methods and to establish a relation between residual BCR-ABL transcript levels and rate of relapse in complete cytogenetic remission (CCR). Response was measured by conventional cytogenetic analysis, hypermetaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (HM-FISH, IP-FISH) of bone marrow (BM) cells, qualitative nested and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BCR-ABL transcripts. We investigated 323 peripheral blood (PB) and BM samples from 48 CML patients who achieved a complete (Ph+ 0%; n=41) or partial (Ph+ 1-34%; n=7) cytogenetic remission after 3-20 months of imatinib therapy. Prior to imatinib, 35 patients were in chronic phase (CP), eight in accelerated phase (AP), four in myeloid and one in lymphoid blast crisis. HM-FISH results correlated with ratios BCR-ABL/ABL in PB and BM. In patients with CCR, residual disease was detectable by HM-FISH (31%), IP-FISH (18%), and RT-PCR (100%). During follow-up, BCR-ABL became undetectable in two patients (one CP, one AP) by both nested and quantitative RT-PCR. CCR is ongoing in 30 evaluable patients, 11 patients have relapsed. At the time of best response, median ratios BCR-ABL/ABL were 2.1% (range 0.82-7.8) in patients with subsequent relapse and 0.075% (range 0-3.9) in patients with ongoing remission (P=0.0011). All 16 CP patients, who achieved ratios BCR-ABL/ABL <0.1% as best molecular response are in continuous remission, while 6/13 patients (46%) with ratios >/=0.1% have relapsed (P=0.0036). We conclude that: (i) in patients with CCR to imatinib, HM-FISH and RT-PCR usually reveal residual BCR-ABL+ cells; (ii) RT-PCR results derived from PB and BM are comparable in CP CML; and (iii) low levels of residual disease with ratios BCR-ABL/ABL &<0.1% are associated with continuous remission.","['III.

Exposure of REH cells to BCS elicited DNA degradation and apoptotic cytolysis. BCS stimulated JNK1/JNK2 and p38, and their shared targets c-Jun and ATF2. Inhibition of JNK1/JNK2 (but not of p38) antagonized blasticidin-induced apoptosis, whereas targeting alternative ribosomal sites with KSM or CHX limited translation, but failed to activate the SAPK cascade or initiate apoptosis. Our findings indicate that interference with 28S-rRNA by BCS initiates apoptosis in REH cells through recruitment of SAPK-JNK signaling. Disparities between the lethal actions of BCS, KSM, and CHX appear to reflect established differences in the subribosomal targets of these agents. We propose that the SAPK cascade comprises an essential mechanism for the transduction of specific lethal stress signals emanating from active ribosomes, and that interference with the 28S-rRNA, rather than the peptidyl transfer center of the large subunit, is critical to apoptotic commitment.","['Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center-Houston, Houston, TX, USA.']",,,"['5K01 CA-082404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5K01 CA-100283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) with LY294002 and of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade by PD98059 resulted in decreased XIAP levels (34+/-8.7 and 23+/-5.7%, respectively). We then generated OCI-AML3 cells with constitutively phosphorylated Akt (p473-Akt) by retroviral gene transfer. Neither these nor Akt inhibitor-treated OCI-AML3 cells showed changes in XIAP levels, suggesting that XIAP expression is regulated by PI3K downstream effectors other than Akt. The induction of XIAP expression by cytokines through PI3K/MAPK pathways is consistent with its role in cell survival. Exposure of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic agents decreased XIAP protein levels by caspase-dependent XIAP cleavage. Targeting XIAP by XIAP antisense oligonucleotide resulted in downregulation of XIAP, activation of caspases and cell death, and sensitized HL-60 cells to Ara-C.

In stark contrast to the success of postexposure treatments, we found that CpG treatment of susceptible mice prior to Friend retrovirus infection accelerated the development of virus-induced erythroleukemia. Furthermore, 70.8% of mice that were resistant to Friend virus-induced leukemia developed disease after inoculation of CpG-ODN before infection. The CpG pretreatment of these mice enhanced viral loads in their spleens and blood compared to controls that received ODN without CpG motifs. The main target cells of Friend virus, erythroid precursor cells and B cells, proliferated after CpG-ODN inoculation and provided an enlarged target cell population for viral infection. Our present findings together with our previous report demonstrate that CpG-ODN treatment of viral infections may be a double-edged sword that can result in an effective therapy but also in an acceleration of disease progression depending on the time point of treatment.","['Institut fur Virologie der Universitat Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the interaction of MMTV with its receptor, we aligned the MMTV envelope surface (SU) protein with that of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV) and identified a putative receptor-binding domain (RBD) that included a receptor binding sequence (RBS) of five amino acids and a heparin-binding domain (HBD). Mutation of the HBD reduced virus infectivity, and soluble heparan sulfate blocked infection of cells by wild-type pseudovirus. Interestingly, some but not all MMTV-like elements found in primary and cultured human breast cancer cell lines, termed h-MTVs, had sequence alterations in the putative RBS. Single substitution of one of the amino acids found in an h-MTV RBS variant in the RBD of MMTV, Phe(40) to Ser, did not alter species tropism but abolished both virus binding to cells and infectivity. Neutralizing anti-SU monoclonal antibodies also recognized a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that contained the five-amino-acid RBS region from MMTV. The critical Phe(40) residue is located on a surface of the MMTV RBD model that is distant from and may be structurally more rigid than the region of F-MLV RBD that contains its critical binding site residues. This suggests that, in contrast to other murine retroviruses, binding to its receptor may result in few or no changes in MMTV envelope protein conformation.","['Department of Microbiology and Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA73746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA090037/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA90037/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI43310/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated that polytropic MLV isolates comprise two mutually exclusive antigenic subclasses, each of which is reactive with one of two monoclonal antibodies termed MAb 516 and Hy 7. A major determinant of the epitopes distinguishing the subclasses mapped to a single amino acid difference in the SU protein. Furthermore, distinctly different populations of the polytropic MLV subclasses are generated upon inoculation of different ecotropic MLVs. Here we have characterized the majority of endogenous polytropic MLV-related proviruses of NFS/N mice. Most of the proviruses contain intact sequences encoding the receptor-binding region of the SU protein and could be distinguished by sequence heterogeneity within that region. We found that the endogenous proviruses comprise two major groups that encode the major determinant for Hy 7 or MAb 516 reactivity. The Hy 7-reactive proviruses correspond to previously identified polytropic proviruses, while the 516-reactive proviruses comprise the modified polytropic proviruses as well as a third group of polytropic MLV-related proviruses that exhibit distinct structural features. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the latter proviruses reflect features of phylogenetic intermediates linking xenotropic MLVs to the polytropic and modified polytropic proviruses. These studies elucidate the relationships of the antigenic subclasses of polytropic MLVs to their endogenous counterparts, identify a new group of endogenous proviruses, and identify distinguishing characteristics of the proviruses that should facilitate a more precise description of their expression in mice and their participation in recombination to generate recombinant viruses.","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA. levans@niaid.nih.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In search for mediators of progesterone signalling in the female reproductive tract, we discovered induction of PLZF mRNA in primary cultures of human endometrial stromal cells and myometrial smooth muscle cells (SMC) in response to progesterone. Surprisingly, dexamethasone was a more potent inducer of PLZF expression than progesterone and elicited a sustained up-regulation of PLZF mRNA levels within 2 h. Immunofluorescence showed localization of PLZF to the nuclei of dexamethasone-treated SMC. In uterine biopsies, nuclear staining for PLZF was found in myometrial cells and endometrial stromal cells of the secretory phase. The transcriptional start site of the PLZF gene was located to position -5801 in SMC. Transfected promoter constructs containing up to 4.1 kb of 5'-flanking DNA were not induced by activated glucocorticoid or progesterone receptor.

The mutated form of the receptor is constitutively activated and known to play an important role in AML, but the activation state of the overexpressed wild-type (wt) receptor is, at present, unknown. In this study, we examined the activation state of the wild-type receptor in AML. We found that the wild-type receptor was constitutively phosphorylated/activated in 8 of 12 primary AML samples and 4 of 13 leukemia cell lines. To explain why wtFLT3 is often activated, we investigated the expression of its ligand, FL, by these same cells. Coexpression of FL with FLT3 was a universal finding in both primary AML samples and leukemic-derived cell lines. To further prove that autocrine signaling was accounting for the activation, we showed that conditioned media but not fresh media was able to activate FLT3. In addition, an antibody that blocks binding of ligand to the receptor blocks FLT3 activation. Finally, depletion of FL from conditioned media is able to block the activation of FLT3. Taken together, these findings represent strong evidence that wtFLT3 is often constitutively activated in AML and thus, like its mutated form, might contribute to the altered signaling that characterizes leukemogenesis.","['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Oncology, Pediatrica, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",,,"['CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA91177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA60441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,20030911,,,,,,,,

In this study, we present real-time force measurements of the interaction between monocytic human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) cells and a monolayer of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The detachment of HL-60-HUVEC conjugates involved a series of rupture events with force transitions of 40-100 pN. The integrated force of these rupture events provided a quantitative measure of the adhesion strength on a whole cell level. The AFM measurements revealed that HL-60 adhesion is heightened in the borders formed by adjacent HUVECs. The average force and mechanical work required to detach a single HL-60 from the borders of a tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated HUVEC layer were twice as high as those of the HUVEC bodies. HL-60 adhesion to the monolayer was significantly reduced by a monoclonal antibody against beta1-integrins and partially inhibited by antibodies against selectins ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 but was not affected by anti-alphaVbeta3. Interestingly, adhesion was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 100 nM) by a cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide. This effect was mediated via interfering with the VLA-4-VCAM-1 binding. In parallel measurements, transmigration of HL-60 cells across a confluent HUVEC monolayer was inhibited by the cRGD peptide and by both anti-beta1 and anti-alphaVbeta3 antibodies. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the role played by beta1-integrins in leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and transmigration and the role played by alphaVbeta3 in transmigration, thus underscoring the high efficacy of cRGD peptide in blocking both the adhesion and transmigration of monocytes.","['Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, Univ. of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101-6430, USA.']",,,"['DK-45462/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-45695/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-54602/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-55611/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32DK-07521-14/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,20030911,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Since 1977, 544 adult patients (age ranging from 18 to 64 years) diagnosed with hematologic malignancies; 172 acute myeloid leukemia, 83 acute lymphocytic leukemia, 190 chronic myeloid leukemia and 99 others, underwent myeloablative conditioning and ASCT. Low BMI (<20) was seen in 88 patients, normal BMI (20-25) in 290 and high BMI (>25) in 166 patients. The donors were 348 HLA-identical siblings, 157 matched unrelated donors and 39 HLA major mismatched donors. We assessed BMI as a risk-factor controlling for other risk-factors regarding transplant-related mortality, survival and relapse-free survival using the Cox regression model. RESULTS: Patients with a low BMI more often had ALL, were younger, were more often conditioned with total body irradiation and more often received monotherapy as immunosuppression against graft-versus-host disease. BMI had no effect on engraftment, transfusions and acute or chronic GVHD. Patients with BMI <20 had a higher incidence of a-streptococcal septicemia (p=0.005) than did patients with BMI > or = 20, but both groups had a similar incidence of overall bacteremia. Five-year survival was 36% in those with low BMI, 47% in those with normal BMI and 55% in those with high BMI. In multivariate analysis, death was associated with BMI <20 (p=0.023). Other significant factors adjusted for were: diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, donors other than HLA-identical siblings, disease stage beyond first complete remission or 1st chronic phase, transplantation before 1993 and total body irradiation vs. busulfan conditioning.

DESIGN AND METHODS: ADCC was performed by 51Cr release assays in vitro, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IL-2-activated or expanded NK cells, neutrophils or macrophages as effector cells. B lymphoma lines and freshly isolated leukemic samples were used as targets. RESULTS: NK cells, but PMN or macrophages mediated rituximab dependent cellular cytotoxicity against two B lymphoma lines. Purified NK cells (95% CD56+/CD16+) reached 70% lysis at the highest E:T ratio. By contrast, all freshly isolated B leukemia or lymphoma cases, including 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 B-prolymphocytic leukemia, 1 mantle cell lymphoma, 2 marginal zone lymhomas and 2 follicular lymphomas were poorly lysed by ADCC in the same conditions and regardless of CD20 expression levels, reaching a mean of 4% and 27% maximal lysis with PBMC or purified NK cells, respectively. Interestingly, short term IL-2 cultured PBMC, containing 10 % activated NK cells, as well as long-term expanded NK cells, containing 80-95% activated NK cells, became strong ADCC effector cells with rituximab and lysed all leukemic samples to a mean of 57% and 67% at the highest E:T ratio, respectively. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Primary leukemic cells are more resistant than cell lines to rituximab- and NK cell-mediated ADCC but short-term exposure to IL-2 or long-term expansion of NK cells in vitro may provide effective tools to improve the therapeutic activity of rituximab.","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, via Eritrea 62, 20157 Milan, Italy. golay@marionegri.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor (TCR) loci are abnormally located in the vicinity of the entire coding sequences of genes which exert an influence on the normal maturation and differentiation program of lymphoid cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: A patient who presented with a B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia had a t(6;14)(p22;q32). Cytogenetic and molecular findings confirmed the involvement of IgH. Molecular cloning of the breakpoint revealed that this was located near the coding sequence of the Id4 gene, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) inhibitor protein. Alu-repeated sequences at the 6p22 end flanked a short stretch of 10 bases shared by the 6p22 and 14q32 ends, suggesting that a deletion or a looping-Alu mediated mispairing mechanism may lead to this chromosome translocation. RESULTS: Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the Id4 mRNA was abnormally overexpressed in this case. Only the two smaller Id4 mRNA products were detected (1.6 and 1.1 kb). Immunohistochemical analysis of Id4 protein was also assayed in a series of hematologic malignancies. Marked overexpression was found in two cases of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias and in four B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia including one case with the t(8;14) and another case with a p53 mutation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The Id4 gene may behave as an oncogene in some human leukemias, perhaps through its capacity to sequester specific B-cell transcription factors. A genetic recombination between Alu-repeated sequences may not be the exclusive mechanism of generating pathogenic chromosomal translocations.","[""Laboratori d'Hematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Avda Sant Antoni M.

Especially in the low range (<5% CD34+ cells), the nature (normal or malignant) of the CD34+ cells is uncertain. Since only in a minority of cases are molecular techniques applicable, in this study we explored a multiparameter approach using phenotypic and functional characteristics to discriminate normal CD34+ cells from malignant ones. DESIGN AND METHODS: CD34+ cells from 24 AML patients with <5% CD34+ cells and from 3 patients with >50% CD34+ cells were studied immunophenotypically for aberrant phenotypes, CD133 and CD90 expression and for P-glycoprotein activity. RESULTS: In the low (0.02-0.7%) CD34+ range, our approach offered strong evidence for a normal origin of the CD34+ cells in 18/19 cases, which was confirmed by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization on sorted CD34+ cells in 3 cases, which had concomitant presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in the CD34- blasts. In contrast, in the intermediate (1.6-3.5%) CD34+ range, the CD34+ cells appeared as normal in only 1/5 cases. In the high (51-67%) CD34+ range, as expected the majority of CD34+ cells were malignant, although in 2/3 cases a small subpopulation (i.e. 0.15% and 0.20%) of CD34+ cells were of normal origin. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our multiparameter approach enabled us to define the nature of CD34+ cells in AML. This has implications for studies dealing with the characterization of primitive malignant cells. Moreover, it enabled identification of truly CD34 negative AML, which would be eligible for CD34-based immunological purging of autologous stem cell transplants.","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1967 the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont has been collecting cases of malignant tumor, diagnosed in children aged 0-14 years, living in Piedmont. This work aims to update survival rates to 31.12.2000. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study includes 2,678 children diagnosed between 1970-98. Vital status was assessed at the Registry Office of the town of residence. One thousand four-hundred ninety cases were reported to be alive, 1170 dead and for 18 the status was unknown. Thirty-three cases registered with a death certificate only were excluded. Completeness of follow-up was 99.3%. All tumor types were classified according to the Birch-Marsden classification. Histologic verification was available for 94.4% of cases. RESULTS: Survival at 5 years increased over the period 1970-98 for all tumor types with a statistically significant trend over time (p<0.0001). The 5 year survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) increased steadily from 24.7% (95%CI 15.0-34.3) to 87.6% (80.9-94.3), for acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) from 0.0% to 38.1% (17.3-58.9), and for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas from 25.2% (0.6-49.8) to 79.7% (61.9-97.5). Five year survival rates of children with central nervous system tumors increased from 33.4% in 1970-74 to 78.5% in 1990-94 and decreased in 1995-98 to 70.9%. Age <1 year and >50,000x10(6) cells/L at diagnosis were negative prognostic factors for ALL. Age <1 year was a favorable prognostic factor for neuroblastoma. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Survival of children with all types of tumors improved in Piedmont. This improved survival is comparable to that reported by other European and North American population-based cancer registries.","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit of the Center for Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, CPO Piemonte, S.Giovanni Hospital, Turin, Italy.']",,,,,,"['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Italy']",,,,,,,

In the present study, high levels of PYST2 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR and by Northern blotting in bone marrow (BM) leukocytes and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from additional eight AML patients. No PYST2 mRNA was detected in nine out of twelve samples of Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy blood bank donors and very low levels were detected by the same techniques in the other three PBMC samples from the healthy donors. Relatively high levels of PYST2 were detected in a variety of myeloid leukemia and other cancer cell lines.

Exposure of Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cells to galanals resulted in the induction of apoptotic cell death characterized by DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. The mitochondrial damage pathway was suggested to be involved in galanal-induced apoptosis because the treatment of cells with galanals induced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) alteration and cytochrome c release.

In recent years, a variety of recombinant methods have been developed for efficient production of BsAb, both as antibody fragments and as full-length IgG-like molecules. These recombinant antibody molecules possess dual antigen-binding capability with, in most cases, monovalency to each of their target antigens. Here, we describe an efficient approach for the production of a novel tetravalent BsAb, with two antigen-binding sites to each of its target antigens, by genetically fusing a bispecific/divalent diabody to, via the hinge region, the N-terminus of the CH(3) domain of an IgG. The novel BsAb, which we termed ""di-diabody"", represents a tetravalent diabody dimer resulting from dimerization between the hinge region and the CH(3) domains. A di-diabody was constructed using two antibodies directed against the two tyrosine kinase receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor, expressed both in a single Escherichia coli host and in mammalian cells, and purified to homogeneity by a one-step affinity chromatography. Compared to the bispecific/divalent diabody, the tetravalent di-diabody binds more efficiently to both of its target antigens and is more efficacious in blocking ligand binding to the receptors. The di-diabody retained good antigen-binding activity after incubation at 37 degrees C in mouse serum for 72 h, demonstrating good product stability. Finally, expression of the di-diabody in mammalian cells yielded higher level of production and better antibody activity. This design and expression for BsAb fragments should be applicable to any pair of antigen specificities.","['Department of Antibody Technology, ImClone Systems Incorporated, New York, NY 10014, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These antibodies were assessed for their ability to detect the production of fIFN-gamma by specific feline T cell populations ex vivo following coculture with mitogen or feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens for 4 h in the presence of the protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). Production of fIFN-gamma was evaluated using flow cytometry to simultaneously detect PE-labelled surface molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled intracellular fIFN-gamma. Using this approach, our initial studies revealed an upregulation in virus-specific fIFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+)T cells in the lymph nodes of FeLV latently infected cats.","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this pathway Skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) plays a critical role in degrading cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. It is verified that Skp2 is an oncoprotein that promotes cell cycle progression in solid tumor, but its role in leukemia cells remains unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effect of Skp2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides(ASODN) on the growth and proliferation of leukemic K562 cells and its probable mechanism. METHODS: K562 cells were cocultured with Skp2 ASODN. The growth and proliferation of K562 cells were observed with light microscopy and MTT assay. The cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: After treatment with Skp2 ASODN, the growth and proliferation of K562 cells were inhibited and the cell cycle was arrested at G(0)/G(1) phase(Skp2 ASODN group 39.7+/-9.1% vs. control group 31.5+/-7.3%,P< 0.05). Both Skp2 mRNA and its protein levels were down-regulated. Although p27 mRNA level remained unchanged, its protein level was up-regulated. CONCLUSION: Skp2 ASODN can inhibit the growth and proliferation of K562 cells, which is mediated by interfering with ubiquitin-proteosome system and regulating of cell cycle progression.","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, Chongqing, 400016, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the therapeutic potential of ATRA on anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis rats. METHODS: Glomerulonephritis was induced in male Wistar-Kyoto rats on day 0 by an intravenous injection of antirat GBM antibody. On day 14 after the induction of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, some rats were sacrificed (N = 5). Another 10 rats were divided into two groups: the vehicle group (N = 5) and the ATRA treated group (N = 5). ATRA was orally administrated from day 14 to day 27 after disease induction. Blood pressure, body weight, urinary protein excretion, and blood chemistry was determined on days 1, 14, 21, and 27. Kidney samples were obtained on day 28. The kidneys were examined with periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against the proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), rat monocyte and macrophage (ED-1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Glomerular RNA was extracted from isolated glomeruli, and reverse transcription (RT) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. RESULTS: ATRA administration produced a 55% reduction of proteinuria in glomerulonephritis rats. Light microscopic analysis revealed severe necrosis/crescent formation (>50% of the glomerulus) affecting 34% of glomeruli in vehicle rats, whereas ATRA treatment reduced the glomeruli showing severe change to 14%. ATRA also significantly reduced PCNA-positive cells, ED-1-positive cells and alpha-SMA-positive area in the glomeruli. RT-PCR analyses revealed that a wide variety of genes including inflammation related [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPdelta)], cell proliferation-related [platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)] and fibrosis-related [transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), type I collagen, and alpha-SMA) genes were suppressed in the glomeruli of ATRA-treated rats. CONCLUSION: ATRA administration significantly reduced severe necrosis/crescent formation and urinary protein excretion in glomerulonephritis rats. Suppression of a wide variety of gene expression may partly explain the mechanism of ATRA's antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. These data suggest a novel therapeutic application of ATRA toward glomerulonephritis.","['Department of Internal Medicine and Therapeutics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Plasma samples from 19 children with relapsed acute myeloic leukaemia and five children with other malignancies were collected. Daunoxome was administered as a 1- to 2.5 h infusion with doses ranging from 30 to 60 mg m(-2). Overall, 214 samples were analysed for daunorubicin using capillary electrophoresis, and population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using NONMEM. RESULTS: The data were best described by a one compartment model. Inclusion of interoccasion variability in the model (16.7% for clearance) improved strongly the precision of the estimates. The inclusion of body surface area or height as a covariate decreased interindividual variability. However, the best fit was obtained using the absolute dose, and when weight was included as a covariate for clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V ). The final parameter estimates were: CL 6.41 ml h(-1) kg(-1) +/- 0.5 51% and V 65.4 ml kg(-1) +/- 0.5 27% (population mean +/- 0.5 interindividual variability). The area under the curve at a dose of 60 mg m(-2) was 231 mg l (-1)h. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with free daunorubicin, Daunoxome shows a low volume of distribution, a lower clearance and a lower interindividual variability in these parameters. This might be advantageous in reducing the variability in exposure to the drug.","['Institut fur Pharmazeutische und Medizinische Chemie, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat, Hittorfstrasse 58-62, 48149 Munster, Germany. hempege@uni-muenster.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cohort includes 86,572 people with individual dose estimates, 60% of whom have doses of at least 5 mSv. We consider mortality for solid cancer and for noncancer diseases with 7 additional years of follow-up. There have been 9,335 deaths from solid cancer and 31,881 deaths from noncancer diseases during the 47-year follow-up. Of these, 19% of the solid cancer and 15% of the noncancer deaths occurred during the latest 7 years. We estimate that about 440 (5%) of the solid cancer deaths and 250 (0.8%) of the noncancer deaths were associated with the radiation exposure. The excess solid cancer risks appear to be linear in dose even for doses in the 0 to 150-mSv range. While excess rates for radiation-related cancers increase throughout the study period, a new finding is that relative risks decline with increasing attained age, as well as being highest for those exposed as children as noted previously. A useful representative value is that for those exposed at age 30 the solid cancer risk is elevated by 47% per sievert at age 70. There is no significant city difference in either the relative or absolute excess solid cancer risk. Site-specific analyses highlight the difficulties, and need for caution, in distinguishing between site-specific relative risks. These analyses also provide insight into the difficulties in interpretation and generalization of LSS estimates of age-at-exposure effects. The evidence for radiation effects on noncancer mortality remains strong, with risks elevated by about 14% per sievert during the last 30 years of follow-up. Statistically significant increases are seen for heart disease, stroke, digestive diseases, and respiratory diseases. The noncancer data are consistent with some non-linearity in the dose response owing to the substantial uncertainties in the data. There is no direct evidence of radiation effects for doses less than about 0.5 Sv. While there are no statistically significant variations in noncancer relative risks with age, age at exposure, or sex, the estimated effects are comparable to those seen for cancer. Lifetime risk summaries are used to examine uncertainties of the LSS noncancer disease findings.","['Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan. preston@rerf.or.jp']",,,,,,,,['Radiat Res. 2004 Jun;161(6):748.

Rapid cell death/apoptosis was determined either by the dye exclusion test or by the appearance of Annexin V-positive cells and cleaved PARP fragments. Enhancement was observed only at higher concentrations of wortmannin, i.e. 1 microM or more. At these high concentrations, both DNA-PK and ATM were inhibited. X-ray-induced phosphorylation of Ser 15 of p53/TP53, accumulation of both p53/TP53 and p21/WAF1/CDKN1A, and phosphorylation of XRCC4 were all suppressed. The enhancement of apoptosis/rapid cell death by wortmannin was prevented by addition of caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK or Ac-DEVD-CHO, or by transfection and overexpression of mouse Bcl2, which is known as an anti-apoptosis protein. The requirement for a high concentration of wortmannin, i.e. 1 microM or more, indicates that inhibition of both DNA-PK and ATM was necessary for the enhanced apoptosis/rapid cell death. Phosphorylation of AKT/PKB was completely suppressed at a much lower concentration, i.e. 0.1 microM wortmannin, where no enhancement of X-ray-induced apoptosis/rapid cell death was observed. On the other hand, X-ray-induced phosphorylation of JNK and its kinase activity as well as apoptosis/rapid cell death were all significantly enhanced only at high concentrations of wortmannin, i.e. 1 microM or more. Furthermore, the extent of enhancement of both JNK phosphorylation and of apoptosis/rapid cell death by wortmannin was less in Rh1a cells, which are ceramide- and radiation-resistant variant cells compared to the parental MOLT-4 cells. Therefore, activation of the JNK pathway was considered important for the enhancement of X-ray-induced apoptosis/rapid cell death of MOLT-4 cells by wortmannin, because of the requirement for a higher concentration of wortmannin than that required for inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. The suppression of the AKT-dependent pathway by wortmannin may have some underlying role in activating the JNK pathway toward the enhancement of cell death in the current system.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of reactive oxygen species generated per cell was low in the tumor cells compared to spleen cells exposed to 1 to 10 Gy of gamma radiation. This could be due to the higher total antioxidant levels in tumor cells compared to normal cells. Further, the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and cytoplasmic Ca2+ content were appreciable in lymphocytes even at a dose of 1 Gy. In EL-4 cells, no such changes were observed at any of the doses used. About 65% of spleen cells underwent apoptosis 24 h after 1 Gy irradiation. However, under the same conditions, EL-4 and P388 cells failed to undergo apoptosis, but they accumulated in G2/M phase.

This array consists of 260 genes that include cell type-specific markers for embryonic stem (ES) cells and neural progenitor cells as well as growth factors, cell cycle-related genes, and extracellular matrix molecules known to regulate NSC biology. The 500-bp polymerase chain reaction products amplified and validated by using gene-specific primers were arrayed along with positive controls. Blanks were included for quality control, and some genes were arrayed in duplicate. No cross-hybridization was detected. The quality of the arrays and their sensitivity were also examined by using probes prepared by conventional reverse transcriptase or by using amplified probes prepared by linear polymerase replication (LPR). Both methods showed good reproducibility, and probes prepared by LPR labeling appeared to detect expression of a larger proportion of expressed genes. Expression detected by either method could be verified by RT-PCR with high reproducibility. Using these stem cell chips, we have profiled liver, ES, and neural cells. The cell types could be readily distinguished from each other. Nine markers specific to mouse ES cells and 17 markers found in neural cells were verified as robust markers of the stem cell state. Thus, this focused neural stem array provides a convenient and useful tool for detection and assessment of NSCs and progenitor cells and can reliably distinguish them from other cell populations.","['Laboratory of Neurosciences, Gerontology Research Center, National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The start of apheresis was guided by CD34(+) cell measurements in the PB and occurred on or after day 11 after start of mobilization CT in 97% of patients. The median peak (p)CD34(+) cell count in PB uniformly occurred on day 14-15 (range: 6-32 days) after the start of CT, irrespective of the diagnosis (multiple myeloma n = 76, other histology n = 37), the type, but not the amount, of premobilization CT or radiotherapy (RT), the mobilization regimen, or the G-CSF dosage administered. Among more heavily pretreated patients (>six cycles of prior CT or RT), a higher proportion mobilized late (pCD34(+) cell count later than day 20 in 12% and 13%, respectively, versus 2%-5% in the other groups). Therefore, we propose to start measuring CD34(+) cells in the PB on day 11 after the start of mobilization therapy.

To date, there is still much to be discovered about how children with cancer and their families experience childhood cancer symptoms. Accordingly, a longitudinal qualitative study was undertaken between July 1998 and December 2000 to explore and describe the childhood cancer symptom course from the perspectives of children and their families. The study was conducted in three settings: the participants' homes and both an inpatient and outpatient pediatric cancer unit located in Western Canada. Thirty-nine children (4 1/2- to 18-year-old males and females) with mixed cancer diagnoses and their families (parents and siblings) participated in the study. The majority of the children were diagnosed with either leukemia or lymphoma (72%), had siblings (87%), and two parents (87.2%), and remained in remission at the completion of the study (90%). All the children received chemotherapy either alone (56%) or in combination with surgery (18%), radiation (5%), radiation and bone marrow transplant (8%), radiation and surgery (10%), and surgery, radiation, and bone marrow transplant (3%). Multiple methods of data collection were used including open-ended formal interviewing and participant observation. Interview and participant observation data were analyzed by the constant comparative method of data analysis. The creation of illness narratives added to the understanding of children's and families' experiences. In addition to providing a description of how the symptoms affected children's and families' daily living, findings related to how to health professionals can better understand and approach children's cancer symptoms emerged. When families, physicians, nurses, and other health professionals approached children's symptoms solely as side effects (e.g., nausea) or singular physical and psychological states, children provided minimal description of what they were actually experiencing. However, a greater understanding was achieved when the symptoms were approached as dynamic multidimensional experiences that occurred within a particular context. Children experienced symptoms as feeling states. Critical to children's feeling states were the meanings that children and their families assigned to the symptoms. Viewing cancer symptoms in the context of assigned meanings has implications for how symptoms are assessed and managed. The need to develop a children's symptom assessment tool based on assigned meanings is recommended.","['Faculty of Nursing, Helen Glass Center for Nursing, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3T 2N2, Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We established in vivo human lung vascular-rich tumor models using a vascular endothelial growth factor-secreting tumor (SBC-3/VEGF). SBC-3/VEGF tumors exhibited a high degree of angiogenesis in comparison with the mock transfectant (SBC-3/Neo) tumors in a dorsal skinfold chamber model and grew much faster and larger than SBC-3/Neo tumors in the tumor growth study. The antitumor activity of antimicrotubule agents, including TZT-1027, was evaluated in both early- and advanced-stage SBC-3/Neo and SBC-3/VEGF tumor models to elucidate the relationship between the antitumor activity and anti-vascular effect of these agents. TZT-1027 exhibited potent antitumor activity against both early- and advanced-stage SBC-3/Neo and SBC-3/VEGF tumors, whereas combretastatin A4 phosphate did not. Vincristine and docetaxel exhibited potent antitumor activity against early-stage SBC-3/Neo and SBC-3/VEGF tumors, and advanced-stage SBC-3/Neo tumors, but did not exhibit activity against advanced-stage SBC-3/VEGF tumors. The difference in antitumor activity between these agents could be ascribed to differences in direct cytotoxicity and anti-vascular effect. Furthermore, a prominent accumulation of erythrocytes in the tumor vasculature, followed by leakage and scattering of these erythrocytes from the tumor vasculature, was observed after TZT-1027 administration to mice bearing advanced-stage SBC-3/VEGF tumors. These findings strongly suggest that TZT-1027 has a potent anti-vascular effect, in addition to direct cytotoxicity.","['Medicinal Research Department, Teikoku Hormone Mfg.

Accumulation of the sphingolipid ceramide and reactive oxygen species are among these pathways. Crossregulation of these two pathways is possible owing to the demonstrated inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase by glutathione, the predominant cellular antioxidant, and has been observed in some cytokine-dependent cell-death models. In a model of irradiation-induced cell death of Molt-4 leukaemia cells, it was found that ceramide accumulation and glutathione depletion were dependent on p53 up-regulation. The loss of p53 owing to expression of the papilloma virus E6 protein inhibited both pathways after irradiation. However, in this model, these two pathways appeared to be independently regulated on the basis of the following observations: (1) glutathione supplementation or depletion did not alter irradiation-induced ceramide accumulation, (2) exogenous ceramide treatment did not induce glutathione depletion, (3) glutathione depletion was dependent on new protein synthesis, whereas ceramide accumulation was independent of it and (4) caspase activation was required for ceramide accumulation but not for glutathione depletion. Furthermore, caspase 9 activation, which is dependent on the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, was not required for ceramide accumulation. This suggested that a caspase, other than caspase 9, was necessary for ceramide accumulation. Interestingly, Bcl-2 expression inhibited these pathways, indicating a possible role for mitochondria in regulating both pathways. These findings indicate that these two pathways exhibit cross-regulation in cytokine-dependent, but not in p53-dependent, cell-death models.","['Department of Biochemistry, American University of Beirut, P.O.

Monoclonal antibodies are a new class of agents targeted at specific receptors on cancer cells. In addition to having direct cellular effects, antibodies can carry substances, such as radioactive isotopes, toxins, and antineoplastic agents, to the targeted cells. Five monoclonal antibodies--rituximab, trastuzumab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, alemtuzumab, and ibritumomab tiuxetan--are available for clinical use. Rituximab is active against indolent lymphomas, providing a valuable alternative for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP) increased survival over CHOP alone in patients with high-grade lymphomas. Trastuzumab has significant activity against HER-2-positive breast cancer, especially in combination with paclitaxel or an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an active second-line therapy in older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, but its role in combination regimens is unclear. Alemtuzumab is a valuable option for salvage therapy of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibritumomab tiuxetan delivers radioactive isotopes to tumor cells and is active against indolent lymphomas in patients who have relapsed after chemotherapy or rituximab therapy. The most common adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies are myelosuppression, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Rituximab may cause tumor lysis syndrome, arrhythmias, and pulmonary dysfunction. Alemtuzumab causes immunosuppression, increasing the risk of infection. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin may cause hepatotoxicity, and trastuzumab may cause significant pulmonary or cardiac toxicity. Investigational monoclonal antibodies include edrecolomab and tositumomab.

Results of previous studies have suggested that maternal vitamin intake may decrease the risk of several childhood cancers. In January 1997, Canada began fortifying flour with folic acid for the prevention of neural tube defects. The effect of folic acid fortification on the rate of neuroblastoma in offspring is not known. METHODS: We investigated the rates of neuroblastoma (<1 year), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and hepatoblastoma registered by the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, which captures 95% of all pediatric cancers in Ontario, before and after the introduction of folate fortification. RESULTS: An interventional time series analysis showed that the incidence of neuroblastoma declined from 1.57 cases per 10,000 births before to 0.62 case per 10,000 births after folic acid fortification (P <.0001). The crude incidence rate ratio (0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.64) remained significant after adjustment for both age and disease stage at diagnosis (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.62). In contrast, there was no significant change in the rate of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (incidence rate ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-2.27) or hepatoblastoma (incidence rate ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.89). CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid fortification was associated with a 60% reduction in neuroblastoma but was not associated with any change in the rate of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia or hepatoblastoma. Further investigation is needed into the role of metabolism in the formation and prevention of neuroblastoma and other embryonically determined cancers.","[""Motherrisk Program and Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, and Department of Medicine and Prehospital Care Programme, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]",,,,,,,,['Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2004 May;75(5):489; author reply 490.

The syndrome is characterized by liver enlargement, fluid retention, jaundice, and weight gain. Endothelial injury has been described as the precipitating factor. The link between busulfan administration and endothelial damage has not been established thus far. METHODS: Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid expression arrays were used to screen for busulfan responsive genes in ECV304 cells. Specific messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Serum samples of 15 pediatric patients with leukemia were analyzed for busulfan and cytokine levels. RESULTS: We identified a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, activin A, to be induced in the human cell line ECV304 after exposure to busulfan in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Maximum effects were observed at 120 and 168 hours for activin A messenger ribonucleic acid and protein, respectively. Preincubation with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (10 nmol/L) abolished activin A induction by busulfan (P <.05). Activin receptors were detected in ECV304. Both tissue factor and cyclooxygenase 2 were significantly induced by busulfan (P <.05). In a parallel in vivo study a significant increase in serum activin A concentration was found 4.5 hours after the second dose of busulfan. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that busulfan induces activin A both in vitro and in vivo. In view of the multiple targets of activin A (inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, and coagulation), these findings may be of relevance to our understanding of venous occlusive disease.","['Department of Pharmacology, Peter Holtz Research Center of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Ernst Moritz Arndt-University, Greifswald, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of their low titers and poor proliferation rate in the adult nervous system, the application of retroviral vectors to the nervous system has been limited. To overcome this disadvantage, we have attempted to achieve higher viral titers and apply them to the embryonic mouse brain. By utilizing our improved packaging cell line and concentrating the viral supernatant by the low-speed centrifugation method, we have successfully increased the retroviral titer up to 10(12) cfu/ml. This titer is over 10(6)-fold greater than routinely achieved retroviral titers, and is comparable to, or even higher than, those of adenoviral vectors. We investigated the efficacy of gene transfer into the nervous system, which has thus far proven quite recalcitrant to genetic transfer by characteristically low retroviral titers. Using our retroviral preparation, we have demonstrated the highly efficient delivery and long-term expression of a foreign gene into neural cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that predominant gene delivery into the neurons of one cortical layer can be achieved by choosing an appropriate date of retroviral infection.","['Laboratory of Neural Information, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan.']","['Copyright 2003 S.

On the 21st day of the first induction course she developed acute fulminant quadriparesis with total areflexia. The clinical features, nerve conduction and the cerebrospinal fluid studies were consistent with acute Guillain-Barre syndrome. She was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) that resulted in only partial improvement. A second course of IVIG was given 2 weeks later that improved her condition slowly and steadily over a period of 12-16 weeks; the patient was able to walk with minimal support. CONCLUSION: The fulminant neuropathy was most likely due to the association between Guillain-Barre syndrome and leukaemia rather than vincristine neurotoxicity.

We show that synaptotagmin (Syt) IX, a member of the Syt family of proteins, localizes to the ERC and is required for export from the ERC to the cell surface. We demonstrate that rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells endogenously express Syt IX mRNA and protein. Localization studies employing fractionation on linear sucrose gradients combined with confocal microscopy by indirect immunofluorescence or stable expression of a Syt IX-green fluorescent fusion protein demonstrate that Syt IX colocalizes with internalized transferrin (Tfn) and with Rab 11 at the perinuclear ERC. Syt IX also colocalizes with tubulin at the microtubules organizing center (MTOC) and remains associated with tubulin clusters formed in taxol-treated cells. Moreover, Syt IX coimmunoprecipitates with tubulin from intact RBL cells, and chimeric fusion proteins comprising either the C2A or the C2B domain of Syt IX are able to pull down tubulin from RBL cell lysates. To study the functional role of Syt IX, we have stably transfected RBL cells with Syt IX sense or antisense cDNA and monitored the routes of Tfn internalization and recycling in cells that overexpress (RBL-Syt IX+) or display substantially reduced (<90%) levels of Syt IX (RBL-Syt IX-). In these cells, Tfn binding and internalization into early endosomes and the ERC are unaltered. However, recycling from the ERC to the cell surface is significantly slowed down in the RBL-Syt IX- cells. These results therefore indicate that Syt IX is involved in regulating transport from the ERC to the cell surface, and suggest that it may play a role in linking vesicles that exit the ERC with the microtubules network.","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",,,,,20030909,,,,,,,,

Also this approach has the advantage that it is applicable not only to binary classification but also to multiple classification problems. We demonstrated the performance of the method by applying it to the publicly available microarray datasets, leukemia (two classes) and small round blue cell tumors (four classes).

We wanted to determine whether the level of CXCR-4 expressed by hematopoietic stem cells could influence mobilization process and therefore could be considered a predictive factor for mobilization adequacy.

In this study, we also compared CXCR-4 expression on CD34+ cells from different sources and at different migration stages specifically bone marrow (BM), steady state peripheral blood (SSPB), fetal cord blood (FCB), cord blood (CB), and mobilized PBSC. Seven (29%) of the 24 patients undergoing mobilization failed to achieve an adequate number of CD34+ stem cells (5 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells) and showed a very high expression frequency of CXCR-4 on BM CD34(+) stem cells (mean number of positive cells, 97%) investigated before the mobilization regimen. We also found that high expression intensity per cell for CXCR-4 was associated with lower amounts of mobilized CD34+ cells whereas those patients (17 out of 24 patients, 71%) with lower expression intensity per cell of CD184 on BM CD34+ cells prior to mobilization harvested at least 5 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells. Setting a cut off of 5 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells harvested, patients mobilizing less had a mean value of 97% CD34+ cells expressing CXCR-4 with a relative mean channel fluorescence of 458 whereas patients mobilizing more than 5 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ progenitors showed a mean value of 59.8% CD34+/CXCR4+ cells with a relative mean channel fluorescence value of 305. Interestingly, in the poor mobilizers group, the marrow stromal microenvironment was found to be more severely damaged in comparison with that of good mobilizers. The comparative analysis of CXCR-4 expression showed no difference in percentage values between steady-state PB (87.4%) and BM (85.1%) stem cells whereas mobilized CD34+ stem cells have a lower expression frequency of CXCR-4 (71.6%) compared to that of progenitors from other sources. Fetal blood CD34+ stem cells had the lowest mean expression frequency of CD184 antigen (36.3%), while CB cells had the highest (94.8%). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that monitoring CXCR-4 CD34 double positive cells before mobilization can be regarded as a predictive factor for mobilization outcome, giving us directional cues for the choice of the best stem cell mobilization regimens.","['Section of Hematology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we focused on the evaluation of HLM/OSBP2 expression in malignant cell lines from different origins (blood and solid tumors) and we also evaluated its expression in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, correlating the molecular findings with clinical outcome. Our results showed that HLM/OSBP2 was expressed in 80% of the analysed CML patients, suggesting that this protein could constitute a helpful tool for disease monitoring and reinforces recent findings that HLM/OSBP2 protein could be involved in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state necessary for leukemogenesis.","['Laboratorio de Controle da Expressao Genica, Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho-UFRJ, Centro de Ciencias da Saude (CCS), Ilha do Fundao, Rio de Janeiro, RJ-CEP 21949-900, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identified and characterized human BCL9-like (BCL9L) gene as well as mouse Bcl9-like (Bcl9l) gene by using bioinformatics. Uncharacterized DLNB11 cDNA (AB094091.1) was derived from human BCL9L gene. Nucleotide sequence of mouse Bcl9l cDNA was determined in silico by assembling mouse ESTs BF464707, BQ258167, 5'-truncated BC003321 cDNA, and mouse genome clone RP24-308H8 (AC125129.5). Human BCL9L and mouse Bcl9l genes were found to consist of eight exons. Exon-intron structure was well conserved between human BCL9L and mouse Bcl9l genes. Human BCL9L (1499 aa) showed 94.0% and 34.8% total-amino-acid identity with mouse Bcl9l (1494 aa) and human BCL9, respectively. Six domains (B9H1-B9H6) were conserved among mammalian BCL9 family proteins. B9H1 and B9H2 domains, and N-terminal part of B9H3 domain were identical to HD1, HD2, and HD3 domains conserved between human BCL9 and Drosophila lgs. B9H4, B9H5 and B9H6 were novel domains. B9H4 domain was characterized by multiple Ser-Pro repeats. Human BCL9L mRNA was expressed in fetal brain, adult lung, amygdala, eye, prostate, and also in several types of tumors including pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck tumor and embryonal tumor. BCL9L gene was located between BLR1 and UPK2 genes within the commonly deleted region of neuroblastoma at human chromosome 11q23.3.

The constitutive expression of surface alpha, beta and gamma chains IL-2R was detected in tumor cells by flow cytometry. Using reverse-transcription PCR, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, IL-10 and TNF were found to be present in LBC. In addition, tumor cells were found to constitutively express intracellular IL-2, IL-15, IL-10 and TNF. Despite the production of these cytokines by tumor cells, specific neutralising antibodies did not inhibit LBC proliferation; surprisingly, anti-IL-15 increased LBC cell growth. We also demonstrated that recombinant IL-2 or IL-15 enhanced LBC cell proliferation. Our data suggest that endogenous IL-2 and IL-15 may trigger the proliferation of lymphoma LBC cells, and so their growth could be regulated, at least partly, by IL-2/IL-15/IL-2R system. In addition, IL-10 and TNF, immunosuppressor and pro-metastatic cytokines, respectively, may promote the in vivo growth of the tumor.

In this study, we discovered that it has anti-leukemia activity. HL-60, NB4, U937 and THP-1 human acute myeloid leukemia cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of PC-SPES (0.06-0.5 micro l/ml) for 4 days, and cell numbers were counted by Trypan blue exclusion. PC-SPES inhibited proliferation of these cells with an ED50 of 0.17, 0.09, 0.18, 0.32 micro l/ml, respectively. In clonogenic assay, PC-SPES inhibited growth of HL-60 cells (ED50, 0.043 micro l/ml). On the other hand, PC-SPES (0.1 micro l/ml) stimulated growth of normal myeloid committed stem cells (CFU-GM) by 1.4-fold of control (p=0.03). Anti-leukemia effects also occurred against freshly isolated leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Interestingly, when PC-SPES was combined with ATRA, the antiproliferative effect was markedly enhanced. For example, PC-SPES (0.125 micro l/ml) or ATRA (10(-8) mol/l) inhibited growth of HL-60 cells after 4 days of culture, by approximately 40 and 30%, respectively; simultaneous treatment with both, suppressed growth by 80%. In addition, PC-SPES induced differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 cells, as measured by expression of CD11b and reduction of NBT. ATRA synergistically enhanced this activity. For example, either PC-SPES (0.5 micro l/ml) or ATRA (10(-8) mol/l) induced 23 and 18% of HL-60 cells, respectively to express CD11b on day 2 of culture; and when both were combined, 60% of HL-60 cells were stimulated to express CD11b antigen. Furthermore, PC-SPES (0.5 micro l/ml) produced apoptosis of HL-60 and NB4 cells, as measured by TUNEL assay, with 17% of HL-60 cells and 52% of NB4 cells becoming apoptotic on their third day of culture. Importantly, PC-SPES stimulated expression of the novel myeloid specific transcription factor C/EBPepsilon in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Taken together, PC-SPES inhibits growth and induces differentiation and apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells, and enhances the antiproliferative and prodifferentiative effects of ATRA on these cells. PC-SPES might be useful with ATRA for treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and it could have a role in other types of cancers including MDS.","['Department of Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. ikezoet@med.kochi-ms.ac.jp']",,,['AT 00151/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

We treated human brain cancer and HL-60 leukemia cells, normal B-lymphoid cells, and murine melanoma cells in vitro with different concentrations of Ruta in combination with Ca3(PO4)2. Fifteen patients diagnosed with intracranial tumors were treated with Ruta 6 and Ca3(PO4)2. Of these 15 patients, 6 of the 7 glioma patients showed complete regression of tumors. Normal human blood lymphocytes, B-lymphoid cells, and brain cancer cells treated with Ruta in vitro were examined for telomere dynamics, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis to understand the possible mechanism of cell-killing, using conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed induction of survival-signaling pathways in normal lymphocytes and induction of death-signaling pathways in brain cancer cells.

As4O6 induced apoptosis in U937 leukemic cells at much lower concentrations than As2O3 via an early increase of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. As4O6 generated ROS and induced caspase-3 activation more potently than As2O3 in U937 cells. Incubation of the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and catalase resulted in significant suppression of As4O6-induced apoptotic cell death. These results show that the generation of ROS leads to the consequences associated with apoptosis induced by As4O6.

We previously observed that Survivin is overexpressed in leukemic cell lines and blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). To understand the roles of Survivin in AML and search for new approaches to the treatment of AML, we inhibited Survivin expression in HL-60 cells with a Survivin anti-sense oligonucleotide (sur-AS-ODN) (ISIS 23722). This blocked significant numbers of HL-60 cells in G2/M phase, and halted cell proliferation at 24 hrs and progressing over time. There was only a slight increase in the number of apoptotic cells at 24 hrs compared with cells treated with nonsense oligonucleotide (NS-ODN). At 48 hrs, however, there were significant increases in sub-G1 phase and annexin V+ cells, suggesting that cell division defects caused cell death. This was supported by the finding that a reduction in the Survivin protein by sur-AS-ODN in cells under serum-free medium did not induce G2/M block and cell death compared to cells treated with NS-ODN. The formation of polyploid cells was observed 48 hrs after sur-AS-ODN treatment, as was the activation of caspase 3, which suggested that apoptotic cell death had occurred. The mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and Smac and the nuclear translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor were also detected. Our results suggest that Survivin is essential for cell cycle progression in leukemic cells. Reduced Survivin expression causes a cell-cycle defect that leads to cell death through a mitochondrial pathway. This finding has potential utility for therapy of patients with AML.","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Cells stably transfected with an IkappaBalpha ""super-repressor"" lacking phosphorylation sites necessary for proteasomal degradation exhibited diminished IkBa phosphorylation and NF-kappaB DNA binding upon exposure to TNFalpha When exposed to NaB (1 mM; 48 hr) or PMA (5 nM; 24 hr), IkappaBalphaM cells displayed a marked reduction in G1 arrest compared to Neo controls. In each case, this was accompanied by a significant reduction in the percentage of cells expressing the differentiation markers CD11a, CD11b, and CD18. The impairment in NaB-induced maturation in mutant cells was associated with a reciprocal increase in apoptosis. In contrast to impairment in NaB- or PMA-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding, stable expression of the IkappaBalphaM did not modify DNA binding of SP1 or AP2 transcription factors. IkappaBalphaM cells also displayed impairment in NaB- and PMA-mediated induction of p21CIP1 and phosphorylation (inactivation) of p34cdc2, as well as diminished levels of pRb-bound E2F1. Finally, the NF-kappaB inhibitor CAPE antagonized NaB- and PMA-related NF-kappaB DNA binding as well as induction of p21CIP1. Together, these findings suggest that NF-kappaB plays an important functional role in mediating NaB-induced p21CIP1 induction, G1 arrest, and maturation in human myelomonocytic leukemia cells, and that disruption of the NF-kappaB pathway causes cells to engage an alternative, apoptotic program.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",,,,,,,,['Cell Cycle. 2003 Sep-Oct;2(5):452-3.

CEM cells that had been established resistant to BCNU (CEM-R) were evaluated in comparison with parental CEM cells (CEM-S). The excision repair kinetics were quantitated as the amount of DNA single strand breaks, which were generated from the incision/excision of the damaged DNA and were diminished by the rejoining of renewed DNA, using the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. CEM-R cells were 10-fold more resistant to BCNU than CEM-S cells, and also showed cross-resistance to melphalan and cisplatin. In response to the treatment with BCNU, both CEM-S and CEM-R cells initiated an incision/excision reaction at the end of the incubation period, and completed the rejoining process within 4 hr. While CEM-S cells could not repair the damage induced by the high concentration of BCNU, CEM-R cells completed the repair process regardless of BCNU concentrations, suggesting enhanced excision repairs in CEM-R cells. The excision repair activity of CEM-R cells was increased with regard to the incision reaction and to the rate of the repair. Similar results were obtained using ultraviolet C, suggesting enhanced nucleotide excision repair in CEM-R cells. Thus, the enhanced DNA excision repairs were successfully quantitated in the resistant leukemic cell line using the Comet assay. The evaluation of the repair activity may predict the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and provide a clue to overcome the resistance.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, 23, Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. tyamauch@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite several advances in therapeutic options, the disease remains incurable. Recently, it was repeatedly demonstrated that statins, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, have antineoplastic effects. Therefore we aimed to study the effects of simvastatin (Sim) on malignant B cells derived from patients with CLL and mechanisms of action of the drug. METHODS AND RESULTS: Purified B-CLL cells from 15 patients were cultured either alone or with Sim at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 microM. Viability, measured by the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, was reduced significantly in the cells treated with Sim at 50 and 100 microM for 24 hours (p<0.005). The level of apoptosis, as measured by annexin binding to exposed phosphatidylserine moieties, increased significantly in the treated cells at concentrations higher than 50 microM for 24 hours (p<0.003). The level of necrosis, as measured by propidium iodide internalization, increased significantly after 24 hours exposure to Sim at 50 microM (p<0.01). The apoptotic cascade was studied by immunoblot analysis of caspases following Sim treatment. These showed cleavage of caspases 9, 8, and 3. Addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk inhibited caspase 8 and 3 significantly but did not affect caspase 9. CONCLUSION: Exposure of clonal B lymphocytes from patients with CLL to simvastatin decreases viability significantly by the induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis induced by Sim is probably initiated by the mitochondrial caspase 9, which indirectly leads to activation of caspase 3 and 8.","['Oncogenetic Laboratory, Meir Hospital, Kfar-Saba, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tissue distribution of the mHags and the HLA molecules by which they can be presented play a significant role in the clinical outcome of T-cell responses against these antigens. In part, differential recognition by T cells of mHags specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, including the malignant cells from the recipient may result in GVL reactivity without concurrent GVHD. Furthermore, T-cell responses against proteins solely expressed in hematopoietic cell lineages from which the malignancy is derived may be appropriate mediators of GVL reactivity without GVHD induction. Characterization of clinical immune responses in patients treated for relapsed leukemia after allogeneic SCT with donor lymphocyte infusion in the absence of GVHD may lead to the characterization of new mHags that can be exploited to generate tumor-specific immune responses. By in vitro generation of T-cell responses against defined mHags, the efficacy and specificity of cellular immunotherapy against hematologic malignancies in the context of allogeneic transplantation may be improved.","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. falkenburg.hematology@lumc.nl']",,67,,,,,,,,,,,

When used under conditions that preserved an adequate fraction of normal human granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM), CV-PDT failed to achieve meaningful reductions of DU145 prostate, H69 small cell lung cancer, and MDA-MB-435S breast cancer cells. Melphalan-resistant L1210/L-PAM1, adriamycin-resistant P388/ADR, and adriamycin-resistant HL-60/ADR leukemia cells were markedly less sensitive to CV-PDT than their wild-type counterparts, whereas cisplatin-resistant H69/CDDP cells were more sensitive than wild-type H69 cells. Sequential exposure to MC540- and CV-PDT under conditions that preserved an adequate fraction (73% and 29%, respectively) of normal CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors was highly effective against H69 (99.997% reduction) and H69/CDDP (99.999% reduction) cells, but ineffective against HL-60/ADR, MDA-MB-435S, and DU145 cells. CV thus shows only limited promise as a single-modality purging agent. However, in certain situations, clinically meaningful tumor cell depletions can be obtained by using CV in combination with a second photosensitizer such as MC540.","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",,,['CA77387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study is to investigate how hypusine formation modulate the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in leukaemia cells. The effects of 1,7-diaminoheptane (DAH), a potent inhibitor of deoxyhypusine synthase, on proliferation and cell viability of leukemia cell lines (Mo7e, TF-1 and THP-1) and MCF-7 cells, were investigated. eIF-5A expression level was detected after cell synchronization. The results showed that inhibition of cell proliferation by DAH was in a concentration-dependent manner while apoptosis was also induced at the same time. Upon treatment of the cell lines with DAH, cell growth was inhibited. Cell cycle analysis showed that DAH induced cell growth arrest at the G(1)-S boundary of the cell cycle. In synchronized MCF-7 cells, the expression level of eIF-5A peaked at G(1) phase but very low at S and G(2)/M phases. It is concluded that hypusine formation of eIF-5A exits in the regulation of cell cycle and the results suggest that eIF-5A is involved in the expression of proteins regulating transition of G(1)-S phase of cell cycle.","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two patients developed histologically confirmed hepatic metastasis from breast cancer and colic adenocarcinoma respectively 11 and 4 months after the beginning of fludarabine-therapy. Purine analogs have been reported to be effective against chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent lymphomas. However, these drugs induce severe immunodeficiency. In addition to the infectious diseases related to the treatment, the use of these drugs could facilitate the development of secondary neoplasms, related to the patient's impaired immunosurveillance. The surprisingly short latency between the therapy and the reappearance of non hematological cancers seen in our patients suggests that treatment with purine analogs may be involved in the reappearance of the tumors.

We studied the effect of antioxidants on this apoptosis in order to learn how the universal signal mediators, reactive oxygen species (ROS), are involved. Caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation were both suppressed by vitamin E (VE), t-butylhydroxyanisole, and luteolin. The ROS formation in the AD treatment was evidenced by flow cytometry, and further supported by suppression of caspase-3 activation by superoxide radical-forming enzyme inhibitors (TTFA, rotenone, and DPI). The inhibition of apoptosis by VE was completed during the initial 1-h treatment with AD, but it did not appear when VE was added with CL to washed cells after AD treatment. Luteolin, an iron chelator PDTC, and a water-soluble VE analogue, trolox, inhibited the apoptosis when added with CL after the AD treatment. Western blot analysis showed that the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 were both inhibited when VE was added with AD or when luteolin was added with CL, and that the cytochrome c liberation was suppressed by both antioxidants. This result implies that the ROS are initially formed in lipophilic environments (e.g. mitochondrial membrane) and then they diffuse into an aqueous environment (i.e. cytoplasm) where they promote the apoptotic process in combination with the cytoskeletal disruption. Thus, the different antioxidants are effective to scavenge ROS for preventing the apoptosis in its different phases.","['Institute for Biological Resources and Functions, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: The study group consisted of 28 trephine biopsies. Immunohistochemistry for CD20 antigen was used. Image processing and measurements were performed with AnalySIS 3.0 image analysis system (Soft Imaging System GmbH, Germany) and custom built programs. For planimetric measurements of nuclei, automatic segmentation was implemented. The measured parameters were: surface area, perimeter, minimum, mean and maximum diameter, and a set of form factors. Relative volumes of bone trabeculae, adipose tissue, hematopoietic tissue and neoplastic infiltrate were assessed by the point counting method. Nuclear volume was measured by the point sampled intercept method. Bone marrow fibrosis was assessed using a curvilinear line test system. RESULTS: Significant variability of cell nuclei was found, and their classification into 3 types was possible. The relative frequency of those types was different in various cases and allowed subdivision of cases into 3 groups that differed in some clinical and histologic manifestations. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated the heterogeneity of cell populations of hairy cell leukemia.","['Department of Pathomorphology, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, ul.

However, data on the capacity of different cell types to do so are lacking. In this study, we sought to analyze the amplification potential of primary human T lymphocytes after infection with amphotropic MLV-based RCR. The total number of viral particles produced after 1 or 2 weeks was measured by a quantitative 4070A env-specific RT-PCR assay. The fraction of infectious replication-competent viral particles was analyzed in the PG-4 S+L- assay. From this study, we conclude that the total number of viral particles RCR produced by T lymphocytes is 2-4 logs lower than the number produced by NIH-3T3 cells. Surprisingly, less than 1% of the viral particles produced by primary T lymphocytes appeared to be infectious, while nearly all virions produced by NIH-3T3 were.

Histopathologists, who usually use formalin-fixed tissues, may be confronted with the need to investigate the BCR-ABL rearrangement when evaluating tumor forming infiltrates and bone marrow trephines from patients presenting with chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Therefore, we have established a one-tube multiplex RT-PCR for the detection of common BCR-ABL fusion transcripts (b2a2, b3a2, e1a2) in routinely processed tissues and bone marrow trephines with respect to the inevitable fragmentation of ribonucleic acids in these specimens. RT-PCR products allow distinct and unequivocal differentiation of the underlying fusion in either the Major- or minor-breakpoint cluster region.

We recently demonstrated high-dose BMT in neonatal animals enables chimeric engraftment without toxic myeloablation. Reagents that block T cell costimulation (anti-CD40L mAb and/or CTLA-4Ig) establish tolerant allogeneic engraftment in adult recipients. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) re-establishes failing grafts and treats malignant relapse via a graft-vs-leukemia response. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that combining these approaches would allow tolerant allogeneic engraftment devoid of myeloablation in neonatal normal and mutant mice with lysosomal storage disease. Tolerant chimeric allogeneic engraftment was achieved before DLI only in the presence of both anti-CD40L mAb and CTLA-4Ig. DLI amplified allografts to full donor engraftment long-term. DLI-treated mice either maintained long-term tolerance or developed late-onset chronic graft-vs-host disease. This combinatorial approach provides a nontoxic method to establish tolerant allogeneic engraftment for treatment of progressive childhood diseases.","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA. bws@jax.org']",,,"['CA34196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK41082/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

ELA alone is normally targeted to secretory lysosomes. However, the hybrid proteins and ligand-induced aggregates of them were constitutively secreted and not targeted. The hGH that was released at the FCS in (FKBP*)4-FCS-hGH was also constitutively secreted.

Residual clathrin was mainly membrane-associated, and an increase in shallow pits was noted. The membrane-association of adaptors, clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM), epsin, dynamin, and Eps15 was only moderately affected by the knockdown and all proteins still displayed a punctate staining distribution. Clathrin depletion inhibited the uptake of transferrin but not that of the epidermal growth factor. However, efficient sorting of the epidermal growth factor into hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate-positive endosomes was impaired. Depletion of alpha-adaptin abolished almost completely the plasma membrane association of clathrin. Binding of Eps15 to membranes was strongly and that of CALM moderately reduced. Whereas the uptake of transferrin was efficiently blocked in alpha-adaptin knockdown cells, the internalization and sorting of the epidermal growth factor was not significantly impaired.

As clinical development is pursued, it becomes important to evaluate resistance mechanisms to flavopiridol. To elucidate the contribution of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) to cellular resistance to flavopiridol in acute myeloid leukemia, we studied the relationship between cellular resistance to flavopiridol and mRNA expression of BCRP or P-glycoprotein (P-gp, product of MDR1gene) in blast cells from adult patients with acute leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-one blast cell samples from 20 patients were studied. The expression of BCRP, P-gp, or beta-actin mRNA was determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, using fluorescent hybridization probes to evaluate codon 482, a known site of mutations in BCRP mRNA. In vitro cell viability and apoptosis were examined after 24 h exposure to flavopiridol. RESULTS: BCRP mRNA expression varied over a 200-fold range. In the blast cell samples with BCRP mRNA expression > 10000 copies/pg beta-actin (n = 9), BCRP mRNA correlated proportionally with cell viability in the presence of 250 nM flavopiridol (r = 0.86, P = 0.003) and with apoptosis induced by flavopiridol (r = 0.71, P = 0.031). In contrast, MDR1mRNA expression did not correlate with either flavopiridol cytotoxicity or induction of apoptosis. Melting point analysis of the hybridization probes determined that all 21 patient samples had arginine at codon 482 of BCRP mRNA, the wild-type form.

CIMPR targets newly synthesized ligands to lysosomes and induces internalization/degradation of secreted ligands. A natural soluble form of CIMPR (sCIMPR) neutralizes IGF-II mitogenic potency on hepatocytes and fibroblasts. Herein we show that sCIMPR also inhibits LIF-driven proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. Similar inhibition was observed with IL-6 and IL-11, two other IL-6-type cytokines that do not interact with CIMPR. Neutralizing anti-IGF-II antibodies inhibited IL-6-, IL-11-, and LIF-driven cell proliferation to the same extent as sCIMPR, suggesting that neutralization of serum IGF-II by sCIMPR plays a major role in IL-6-type cytokine-dependent cell proliferation. Confirming this idea, ERK1/2 and AKT/protein kinase B, the kinases necessary for cell proliferation and survival, were activated by IGF-II alone or by the association of IL-6-type cytokines and IGF-II. IL-6-type cytokines alone (up to 10 ng/ml) did not activate ERK1/2 or AKT, but did activate STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), a transcription factor necessary for the G1 to S phase cell cycle transition. Activation of ERK1/2 and AKT by IGF-II thus appears essential to sustain cellular expansion driven by IL-6-type cytokines.","['Group of Recherche Cytokines/Recepteurs/Transduction, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 463, Nantes Cedex 01, France.']",,,,,20030828,,,,,,,,

Between 1976 and 1985, ten patients were diagnosed by clinical manifestation without the application of any cytogenetic study, while from 1986 to 2001, 37 patients were diagnosed as evidenced by the presence of a positive Philadelphia chromosome upon cytogenetic examination. The male-to-female ratio was 0.7 (14 boys/20 girls) for patients under 15 years of age. Abdominal fullness or pain appeared to be the most common presenting symptom, followed by body weight decline and bleeding. Marked leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis were common laboratory findings in these patients. The incidence of only lymphoid blast crisis was 38%, which appears to be the highest incidence when compared to the corresponding value as reported in other studies. Of 25 children treated with conventional chemotherapy including busulfan and hydroxyurea, the median survival period from diagnosis was 44 and 42 months, respectively. Between January 1984 and December 2001, 22 affected children underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT).

METHODS: We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukaemia. Clinical presentation was correlated with leukaemic blast morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic analysis, molecular studies for clonal rearrangements and histological review. RESULTS: The patient had noted skin lesions and a breast infiltrate 4 months prior to the diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy at the time of presentation revealed characteristic morphological features with a dense infiltrate of bizarre, pleomorphic blast cells with marked nuclear invagination and reniform shapes. Immunophenotypic analysis of the blasts displayed coexpression of myeloid and natural killer cell antigens with a relatively immature phenotype: CD34-,HLADR+, CD33+, CD56+, CD16-, CD57-, MPO-. Cyto- genetic analysis revealed a complex karyotype: del(6)(q21);-12 and add(19)(p13). Histological review of the previous breast biopsy was consistent with granulocytic sarcoma of the breast with a phenotype corresponding to the circulating blasts (positive cytoplasmic staining for myeloid markers, CD68 and CD31, and the NK cell marker CD56, with negative staining for MPO). Skin biopsy confirmed leukaemia cutis. CONCLUSION: Although nodal extramedullary disease is common in the myeloid/NK cell leukaemias, this is the first description of myeloid/NK cell leukemia primarily involving breast and skin. We speculate that CD56 may predispose to extramedullary localisation of tumour.","['Northern Blood Research Centre, Department of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intravenous monotherapy, with broad spectrum antibiotics, of patients with a high risk of complications is a possible alternative. METHODS: We conducted a prospective open-label, randomized study of patients with lymphoma or leukemia who had fever and neutropenia during chemotherapy. Patients received either monotherapy with ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (T) or ceftriaxone plus amikacin (C+A). RESULTS: Seventy patients who presented 136 episodes were evaluated, 68 in each arm of the study. The mean neutrophil counts at admission were 217cells/mm(3) (T) and 201cells/mm(3) (C+A). The mean duration of neutropenia was 8.7 days (T) and 7.6 days (C+A). Treatment was successful without the need for modifications in 71% of the episodes in the T group and 81% in the C+A group (p=0.23). Treatment was considered to have failed because of death in two episodes (3%) in the T group and three episodes (4%) in the C+A group, and because of a change in the drug applied in one episode in the T group and two episodes in the C+A group. Overall success was 96% (T) and 93% (C+A). Adverse events that occurred in group T were not related to the drugs used in this study. CONCLUSION: In pediatric and adolescent patients with leukemia or lymphoma, who presented with fever and neutropenia, during chemotherapy, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid was as successful as the combination of ceftriaxone plus amikacin. It should be considered an appropriate option for this group of patients at high risk for infections.","['Pediatric Oncology Institute (GRAACC) Division of Infectious Disease, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil. iopepm@dialdata.com.br']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of red blood cell (RBC) 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) active metabolites, not the dose of 6-MP, is related to cytotoxicity and prognosis. But there is an apparent sex difference in 6-MP metabolism. Boys require more 6-MP than girls to produce the same range of 6-TGN concentrations. Given the same dose, they experience fewer dose reductions because of cytotoxicity, and have a higher relapse rate. 2. The enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) catalyses the initial activation step in the metabolism of 6-MP to 6-TGNs, a step that requires endogenous phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a cosubstrate. Both HPRT and the enzyme responsible for the formation of PRPP are X-linked. 3. RBC HPRT activity was measured in two populations, 86 control children and 63 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 6-MP was used as the substrate and the formation of the nucleotide product, 6-thioinosinic acid (TIA) was measured. RBC 6-TGN concentrations were measured in the leukaemic children at a standard dose of 6-MP. 4. There was a 1.3 to 1.7 fold range in HPRT activity when measured under optimal conditions. The leukaemic children had significantly higher HPRT activities than the controls (median difference 4.2 micromol TIA ml(-1) RBCs h(-1), 95% C.I. 3.7 to 4.7, P < 0.0001). In the leukaemic children HPRT activity (range 20.4 to 26.6 micromol TIA ml(-1) RBCs h(-1), median 23.6) was not related to the production of 6-TGNs (range 60 to 1,024 pmol 8 x 10(-8) RBCs, median 323). RBC HPRT was present at a high activity even in those children with low 6-TGN concentrations. 5. When HPRT is measured under optimal conditions it does not appear to be the metabolic step responsible for the observed sex difference in 6-MP metabolism. This may be because RBC HPRT activity is not representative of other tissues but it could equally be because other sex-linked factors are influencing substrate availability.","['The University of Sheffield, Department Medicine and Pharmacology, Floor L, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, S10 2JF.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then a model of remission was built up, and the effects of ribozyme on bone marrow purging were detected by leukemia colony assay and nest-PCR after transduction of this model by using the ribozyme. The results showed that ribozyme significantly suppressed the clonogenic growth and the expression of p210 protein in primary cells from CML patients, but did not affect the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. In the model of remission, ribozyme eliminated the proliferation and the expression of bcr-abl mRNA in residual K562 cells, but did not affect the expression of abl mRNA.

The viral load obtained by the real-time PCR assay closely paralleled the number of antigen-positive cells obtained with the antigenemia assay. Real-time PCR revealed that a large number of DNA copies could be present even in samples assessed as negative or low in antigen-positive cells (0 to 10 antigen-positive cells/50,000 cells) by antigenemia assay. CMV copy numbers did not differ between the negative and low-antigen-positive groups. When the input concentration for real-time PCR assay was 2,500 to 5,000 copies/ml, the positivity rate for the nested PCR assay was 47.3%, while the positivity rate was more than 90% at an input concentration of >/=50,000 copies/ml. Real-time PCR is more sensitive than the antigenemia and nested PCR assays. Moreover, real-time PCR was able to detect CMV reactivation earlier than the antigenemia and nested PCR assays through the use of longitudinal analysis in four ATL patients with CMV pneumonia. In longitudinal assessments, analysis of the results suggested that a cutoff level of 5,000 copies/ml might be used to initiate treatment. Real-time PCR is more suitable for monitoring CMV reactivation in ATL patients than the antigenemia and nested PCR assays. CMV viral loads of 5,000 copies/ml are proposed as the cutoff for initiating antiviral therapy in ATL patients.","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Oita Medical University, Oita, Japan. ikewaki@oita-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six weeks after MI, IL-6-/- and WT had similar mortality rates, MI sizes, LV remodeling, and LV dysfunction in vivo, determined by catheterization.

Further stratification in patients born before and after January 1996 (approximate time of Health Canada recommendation for folic acid supplement in pregnancy) revealed that the protective effect of MTHFR variants is accentuated and present only in children born before 1996. Similar results were obtained when a transmission disequilibrium test was performed on a subset of children (n = 95) in a family-based study.

Here, we describe a novel chemical series designed against the RRM prototype, CD437. This includes molecules with apoptotic effects in acute promyelocytic leukemia and other myelogenous leukemia cell lines, as well as ST2065, an RRM with antagonistic properties. The most interesting apoptotic agent is ST1926, a compound more powerful than CD437 in vitro and orally active in vivo on severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice that received transplants of NB4 cells. ST1926 has the same mechanism of action of CD437, as indicated by the ability to trans-activate retinoic acid receptor gamma, to induce the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, and to down-regulate the expression of many genes negatively modulated by CD437. ST1926 causes an immediate increase in the cytosolic levels of calcium that are directly related to the apoptotic potential of the RRMs considered. The intracellular calcium elevation is predominantly the result of an inhibition of the mitochondrial calcium uptake. The phenomenon is blocked by the ST2065 antagonist, the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA (1,2 bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester), and by high concentrations of calcium blockers of the dihydropyridine type, compounds that suppress ST1926-induced apoptosis.","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri,"" Milano, Italy. egarattini@marionegri.it']",,,,,20030904,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of the ATM or TP53 gene is frequent in B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and leads to aggressive disease. Although the ATM and p53 pathways overlap, they are not congruent, and it is unclear how the mechanism of tumor progression differs between ATM- and p53-deficient tumors. Using microarray analysis of ATM-mutant, TP53-mutant, and ATM/TP53 wild-type B-CLLs, we show that after exposure to DNA damage transcriptional responses are entirely dependent on ATM function. The p53 proapoptotic responses comprise only a part of ATM-regulated transcription; additionally, ATM regulates prosurvival responses independently of p53. Consequently, the greater severity of the TP53-mutant B-CLLs compared with ATM-mutant B-CLLs is consistent with the additive effect of defective apoptotic and elevated survival responses after DNA damage in these tumors. We also show that transcription expression profiles of ATM-deficient, TP53-deficient, and wild-type B-CLLs are indistinguishable before irradiation. Therefore, damage-induced transcriptional fingerprinting can be used to stratify tumors according to their biologic differences and simultaneously identify potential targets for treating refractory tumors.","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom. t.stankovic@bham.ac.uk']",,,,,20030904,,,,,,,,

Fewer patients in the post-ULR group received HLA-matched platelets (14% vs 5%, P <.001). Alloimmunization and alloimmune refractoriness in the 318 patients who were previously pregnant and/or transfused were also reduced after ULR (P =.023 and P =.005, respectively).

When leukemia relapses after allogeneic SCT, donor lymphocyte transfusions (DLTs) can induce sustained remissions in some patients. This review summarizes the current status on clinical use of DLT, the basis of GVL reactions, problems associated with this therapy, and new strategies to improve DLT. Several multicenter surveys demonstrated that the GVL effect of DLT is most effective in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), whereas it is less pronounced in acute leukemia and myeloma. Cytokine stimulation to induce differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells or to up-regulate costimulatory molecules on tumor cells may improve the efficacy of DLT. Infections and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are major complications of DLT. Control of GVHD may be improved using suicide gene-modified T cells for DLT, allowing T-cell elimination if severe GVHD develops. Hopefully, in the future, GVL effect can be separated from GVHD through adoptive transfer of selected T cells that recognize leukemia-specific antigens or minor histocompatibility antigens, which are expressed predominantly on hematopoietic cells, thereby precluding attack of normal tissues. In patients with leukemia and lymphomas with fast progression, tumor growth may outpace development of effector T cells. Here it may be preferable to select stem cell transplant donors with HLA-mismatches that allow alloreactive natural killer cells, which appear early after transplantation, to retain their cytolytic function. New approaches for adoptive immune therapy of leukemia, which promise a better prognosis for these patients, are being developed.","['Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Dept of Medicine III, Clinical University of Munich-Grosshadern, Marchioninistr 15, 81377 Munich, Germany. hans.kolb@med.uni-muenchen.de']",,125,,,20030904,,,,,,,,

It is well established that estrogen and progesterone are the critical endocrine determinants of endometrial functions. However the precise delineation of hormone driven events and their interaction is yet to be ascertained. Several attempts have been made to understand these cascades, however most of these studies have been conducted in vitro using one or the other component of endometrial tissues.

The results coincided with those observed in the endometrium of the other model, bonnet monkeys presenting normal hypothalamus-ovarian-pituitary function but displaying retarded endometrial growth due to blocked progesterone receptor. A significant decline was observed in the expression of transforming growth factor beta, transforming growth factor beta receptor, leukaemia inhibitory factor, whereas no remarkable changes were observed in the expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptors in response to neutralization of progesterone synthesis/function in these two animal models.

It is thought to play an antimutagenic role by preventing the incorporation of promutagenic 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA. As found in our previous investigations, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-diphosphate (8-oxo-dGDP) strongly inhibited 8-oxo-dGTPase activity of MTH1. Following this finding, in the present study we have tested the canonical ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates (NDPs and dNDPs) for possible inhibition of 8-oxo-dGTP hydrolysis by hMTH1 extracted from CCRF-CEM cells (a human leukemia cell line). Among them, the strongest inhibitors appeared to be dGDP (Ki=74 microM), dADP (Ki=147 microM), and GDP (Ki=502 microM). Other dNDPs and NDPs, such as dCDP, dTDP, ADP, CDP, and UDP were much weaker inhibitors, with Ki in the millimolar range. Based on the present results and published data, we estimate that the strongest inhibitors, dGDP and dADP, at physiological concentrations not exceeding 5 microM and GDP at mean concentration of 30 microM, taken together, can decrease the cellular hMTH1 enzymatic activity vs. 8-oxo-dGTP (expected to remain below 500 pM) by up to 15%. The other five NDPs and dNDPs tested cannot markedly affect this activity.","['Laboratory of Comparative Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD, USA. karolb@amb.bydgoszcz.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an assay in which the ability of T cells to antigen specifically inhibit the in vitro growth of leukemic progenitor cells in the presence of cytokines can be measured. This assay allows the evaluation of the cytolytic or suppressive potential of leukemia reactive T cells for prolonged periods of time. The assay is based on inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation by the leukemic progenitor cells induced by multiple hematopoietic growth factors. T cell clones with a known specificity were used to compare the analytic potential of the new assay with those of other cytotoxicity assays. Based on the results of the T cell clones, a modification of a limiting dilution assay was developed to identify anti-leukemic allogeneic T cells in HLA identical donor-recipient combinations selected on their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of CML or AML progenitor cells, to be used for the generation of leukemia-reactive CTL lines for clinical use.","['Laboratory of Translational Research, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center C2-R, P.O.

We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: <or=2 Gy, 2.1-5 Gy, and >5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines. RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.","['Department of Radiation Therapy, Centre Oscar Lambret, Lille, France. y-belkacemi@o-lambret.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Foam cell model was established by incubating the human monoblastic leukemia (U937) cells with ox-LDL. Each protein samples in U937 control cells and U937 foam cells were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). After the gels were stained by silver staining method, the images were analyzed by PDquest 2D-image-analysis software (Bio-Rad). Some of the spots were available via the Internet with links to the U937 proteomic map provided from the ExPASy Proteomics server. RESULTS: Using 2-DE, the overall protein map was obtained, in which 150 spots were matched with the control gel (match ratio: 75 %). Compared with U937 cells, 37 spots significantly changed in the foam cells (P<0.05), among which the expression levels in 28 spots increased and those in 9 spots decreased. Especially, 8 spots in U937 cells were absent in the foam cells, while 11 spots in the foam cells were absent in the control cells. CONCLUSION: The changed protein profiles induced by ox-LDL in U937 foam cells were established to support the functional studies on the macrophage-derived foam cells in atherosclerotic pathological states.","['Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An attempt was also made to investigate the relationship between the cytotoxic activity of berberine and its molecular mechanism of action. Cytotoxicity was measured in-vitro using a primary biochemical screening according to Oyama and Eagle, and the growth inhibition assay. The in-vitro cytotoxic techniques were complemented by cell cycle analysis and determination of apoptotic DNA fragmentation in L1210 cells. Berberine acted cytotoxically on both tumour cell lines. The sensitivity of leukemia L1210 cells to the berberine was higher than that of HeLa cells. The IC(100) was below 100 microg mL(-1) for HeLa cells and approached a 10 microg mL(-1) limit for the leukemia L1210 cells. For both cell lines the IC(50) was found to be less than 4 microg mL(-1), a limit put forward by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for classification of the compound as a potential anticancer drug. In L1210 cells treated with 10-50 microg mL(-1) berberine, G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest was observed. Furthermore, a concentration-dependent decrease of cells in S phase and increase in G(2)/M phase was detected. In addition, apoptosis detected as sub-G(0) cell population in cell cycle measurement was proved in 25-100 microg mL(-1) berberine-treated cells by monitoring the apoptotic DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder) using agarose gel electrophoresis.","['Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, SK-81237 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. jantova@chtf.stuba.sk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known, however, about the significance of this phenomenon in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). We evaluated various morphometric characteristics of microvessels, highlighted by means of anti-CD34 immunohistochemistry, in the bone marrow of 44 patients with typical HCL, before and after treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Overall, bone marrow from 103 HCL patients and 20 controls was examined. Microvessel density (MVD) and several size- and shape-related parameters were quantified in the region of most intense vascularization using image analysis. MVD, size-related parameters and the percentage of branching microvessels were higher in HCL than in controls. Likewise, perimeter counts were higher in partial/non-responders than in complete responders. Achievement of complete response was accompanied by smaller calibre microvessels. IFN-alpha induced a decrease in MVD and branching values in cases with diffuse marrow involvement. In univariate analysis, progression-free survival was adversely affected by MVD, branching and major axis length. Multivariate analysis indicated that MVD/branching independently affected progression-free survival and the likelihood of complete response. Our data suggest that the generation of bone marrow microvessels indicated an increased risk of progression and IFN-alpha treatment failure in HCL. Furthermore, the prognostic significance of angiogenesis requires the concomitant assessment of MVD and the complexity of the microvascular network.","['Department of Pathology, First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. pkorko@cc.uoa.gr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

High rates of complete remission can be achieved with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Treosulfan is an alkylating substance that has been used in the treatment of ovarian carcinomas for many years. It has a favourable side-effect profile even at high-dose protocols. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of treosulfan on myeloma cells. The treatment of the myeloma cell lines, NCI-H929 and U266, with treosulfan led to apoptosis in both cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by cleavage of caspases -3 and -9 as well as downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and upregulation of the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p21WAF1/CIP1. Furthermore, 100 micro mol/l treosulfan was capable of inducing cell death in 63.6 +/- 23.9% of primary myeloma cells, whereas treatment with the same concentration of melphalan showed 59.7 +/- 26% cell death. These in vitro concentrations were at least 10-fold lower than achievable plasma levels, even at conventional doses of treosulfan. Our results suggest that treosulfan might be an appropriate candidate for novel treatment protocols for patients with multiple myeloma.","['Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Medizinische Klinik - Innenstadt, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Laboratory of Molecular Hematology and Oncology, Munich, Germany. geroldmeinhardt@yahoo.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skin scrapings were negative and the eruption worsened despite the completion of chemotherapy and the use of topical corticosteroids. Pustules developed on the face and around the eyelids, associated with bilateral blepharitis and lower lid chalazia. Skin biopsy then revealed heavy infestation with Demodex folliculorum. The child was treated with a combination of topical permethrin and oral ivermectin, with a total of four doses of ivermectin given over 6 weeks. The facial eruption had completely resolved 3 months after initiation of this combined treatment. COMMENT: Demodex infestation can cause dramatic facial and eyelid inflammation in immunocompromised patients. Oral ivermectin, in combination with topical permethrin, can be a safe and effective treatment for severe demodicosis.","[""Department of Medicine (Dermatology), University of Sydney, and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney. diona@canc.rpa.cs.nsw.gov.au""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of FLK/BLV cells with low concentrations of H2O2 (2.5 to 10 microM) induced a marked enhancement of BLV p24 synthesis and an activation of the long terminal repeat (LTR). Higher concentrations resulted in a decrease of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and in a decrease of BLV synthesis. Furthermore, in both cell lines H2O2 treatment led to the activation of NF-kappaB. Pretreatment of cells with antioxidants abrogated the H2O2-induced BLV expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that oxidative stress stimulates BLV expression via activation of NF-kappaB, raising the possibility that biological sources of H2O2, such as stimulated phagocytes, may influence BLV expression.","['Department of Veterinary Biochemistry, Free University of Berlin, Oertzenweg 19b, D-14163 Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rituximab is a genetically engineered, chimeric anti-CD20 mAb with mouse variable and human constant regions. Consecutive clinical trials conducted in the United States, Europe, and Japan have revealed that rituximab is an effective agent, with acceptable toxicities, in the treatment of indolent and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs). A recent European phase III study in elderly patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma suggested that rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) chemotherapy is superior to CHOP chemotherapy alone in terms of complete response rate and event-free and overall survivals. Lymphoma is inherently a radiosensitive tumor. The aim of radioimmunotherapy is to use the mAb to target radiation to lymphoma tissue while minimizing toxicity to normal cells. Clinical trials of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and (131)I-tositumomab showed that they have definitive efficacy in relapsed indolent B-NHL, with acceptable toxicities. A recent comparative study in relapsed indolent B-NHL showed that (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan produced a higher response rate than rituximab. In addition, BL22, a recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin, showed significant efficacy in patients with chemotherapy-resistant hairy cell leukemia.

From the results obtained to date, two clear conclusions can be drawn: First, whatever the age of the patient, phlebotomy must be used to avoid the menace of vascular complications before the institution of basic treatment, but it cannot be used as the sole form of treatment. Second, 32P treatment retains an important role at least when chemotherapy fails and in elderly patients (>70 years).","['UPRES EA No. 27-10 and Nuclear Medicine Department, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. viola@igr.fr']",,,,,20030903,,,,,,,,

IDA is known to be less sensitive towards multidrug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This phenotype is a major impediment to successful antineoplastic treatment, but P-gp is also expressed on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). METHODS: We investigated the pharmacokinetics of IDA and etoposide (ETO) in seven previously untreated patients with aggressive NHL. The patients received a CHOP-derived protocol (CIVEP) in which doxorubicin (DOX) was substituted by IDA 11-16 mg/m(2) and ETO 3 x 100 mg/m(2) was added. Furthermore, we evaluated in vitro the impact of P-gp expression on the cytotoxicity of DOX and IDA in cells from three parental chemosensitive leukemia and lymphoma cell lines (HL60, U937, CCRF) and their resistant sublines, as well as in CD34-positive HSC. RESULTS: The peak plasma levels (C(max)), terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)) and area under the concentration curve (AUC) both for IDA and for ETO did not differ from published data. In cell line models the numbers of viable cells in a P-gp-expressing resistant CCRF-VCR100 subline were significantly more reduced by IDA ( P<0.001), but there was no difference in the cytotoxicities of IDA and DOX in chemosensitive CCRF cells and in the (non-P-gp-expressing) resistant U937 and HL60 sublines. Cytotoxicity against HSC was more pronounced after incubation with IDA than after treatment with DOX ( P=0.014), even when a tenfold higher concentration of DOX than of IDA was used. The addition of cyclosporin A increased the cytotoxic effect of DOX but not that of IDA in HSC. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of IDA and its main metabolite idarubicinol in CHOP-derived protocols were not different from data obtained with other combinations or monotherapy. The increased myelotoxicity of IDA may be a consequence of P-gp expression in CD34-positive HSC.","['1st Medical Department, Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany. kroschinsky@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",,,,,20030903,,,,,,,,

Epub 2003 Sep 3.,['10.1007/s00280-003-0699-4 [doi]'],,,"PURPOSE: Troxacitabine (BCH-4556, l-(-)-OddC, Troxatyl) is a novel beta- l-nucleoside analogue with potent antineoplastic activity both in vitro and in several tumor models in vivo, and is presently in phase II clinical trials. The combination of the cytosine analogues troxacitabine and araC (1-beta- d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, cytarabine) has shown promising activity in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. To further examine the interactions between these two analogues, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of their combination against a human leukemia cell line, CCRF-CEM. METHODS: . The in vitro cytotoxic effect of the combination of troxacitabine and araC on the survival of CCRF-CEM cells was measured using a standard MTT assay and combination indices were generated with the CalcuSyn software. For in vivo studies, we evaluated the effect of both drugs, alone and in combination, on survival of CCRF-CEM tumor-bearing animals. Mechanistic studies addressed recovery of DNA synthesis, intracellular levels of araC metabolites, feedback inhibition by triphosphate species and pharmacokinetics of both drugs. RESULTS: The combination of troxacitabine and araC in vitro was synergistic with combination indices between 0.1 and 0.7. This appeared to be related to the impact of the combination on DNA synthesis recovery, which was significantly delayed following exposure to the combination of troxacitabine and araC compared to either agent alone. Analysis of the effect of troxacitabine on the intracellular metabolites of araC revealed that troxacitabine did not inhibit araC deamination and caused a slight decrease in the overall intracellular accumulation of araCTP. The lower accumulation of araCTP could not be attributed to feedback inhibition caused by troxacitabine triphosphate on dCK. Furthermore, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of araC and troxacitabine was better at slowing down the progression of leukemia in SCID mice than either agent used alone without additive toxicities. Injections of 10 mg/kg troxacitabine i.p. daily for 5 days in combination with araC at 10 mg/kg led to an increase in median survival time of 58 days compared to 49.5 and 53.5 days for araC and troxacitabine, respectively, given as single agents. This represents an increase in life span of 17%, respectively when compared to araC alone. A pharmacokinetic study revealed that troxacitabine did not influence the disposition of araC when coadministered. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results show that the antileukemic activity of troxacitabine and araC is complementary when the two nucleoside analogues are combined in vivo. These effects appear to be related to their interaction at the level of DNA repair rather than to pharmacokinetic interactions. These results encourage the use of troxacitabine and araC in combination in patients with acute leukemia.","['Shire BioChem Inc., 275 Armand-Frappier Blvd., Laval, Quebec, H7V 4A7, Canada.']",,,,,20030903,,,,,,,,

The tumor was partially removed by bilateral frontotemporal craniotomy and a diagnosis of primary granulocytic sarcoma was made from the surgical specimen. Progressive deterioration of visual acuity was seen and chemotherapy started on the 11th postoperative day followed by local cranium irradiation (24 Gy). The patient has been in complete remission for 37 months. The visual acuity recovered partially and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed a significant decrease in the size of the tumor. DISCUSSION: Radiological diagnosis of primary intracranial granulocytic sarcoma is difficult. Surgical removal may be an option for progressive neurological deterioration but chemotherapy is more important for both neurological stabilization and induction of remission.","['Department of Neurosurgery and Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, 650-0017 Chuo-ku, Kobe, Japan.']",,,,,20030731,,,,,,,,

We found that the p53 family members were functionally associated with Daxx, which was described originally as a cytoplasmic mediator of Fas signaling, but has been identified recently as a nuclear protein that co-localizes with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and regulates transcription. Extensive yeast two-hybrid assays indicated a physical interaction between a region including the oligomerization domain (OD) of p73alpha (amino acids 345-380) or p53 (amino acids 319-360) and amino acids 161-311 and 667-740 (C-terminal S/P/T-rich domain) of hDaxx, which is the common binding region of Fas, ASK1 and PML. This interaction was further confirmed by in vitro GST pull-down and in vivo immunoprecipitation assays. Both Daxx and p73/p53 co-localized in nuclear dot-like structures, which are probably nuclear PML oncogenic domains (PODs) or the nuclear domain NB10. Transient co-expression of Daxx resulted in strong inhibition of p73- and p53-mediated transcriptional activation of the synthetic p53-responsive and p21WAF1 promoters. Consequently, Gal4-Daxx repressed basal transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with trichostatin A, which is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, or PML over-expression relieved Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression of p53. The mechanism underlying PML-mediated derepression appears to be competitive binding between Daxx, p53 and PML. Taken together, these findings delineate a transcriptional regulatory network that is modulated by differential Daxx-p53-PML interactions in the nuclear PODs. Therefore, Daxx is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of p53 and possibly its family members.","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology/Institute of Bioscience, Sejong University, 98 Kunja-dong, Kwangjin-gu, Seoul 143-747, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies indicated that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) play a role in Ca2+ mobilization during T lymphocyte activation. However, the role of VDCCs in otherwise nonexcitable cells is still poorly understood. We used RT-PCR to identify a transcript encoding the pore-forming alpha1F-subunit of an L-type Ca2+ channel in T lymphocytes. Its identity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To further investigate the contribution of Ca2+ influx through VDCCs, we assessed the effects of the 1,4-dihydropyridine L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, (+/-) Bay K 8644, and antagonist, nifedipine, on the human Jurkat T cell leukemia line, human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and mouse splenocytes. We found that treatment of T lymphocytes with (+/-) Bay K 8644 increased intracellular Ca2+ and induced the activation of phosphoextracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), whereas nifedipine blocked Ca2+ influx, the activity of Erk1/2 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, and IL-2 receptor expression. Nifedipine also significantly suppressed splenocyte proliferation in an in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction and the proliferation of male antigen (H-Y)-specific T cell receptor-transgenic CD8+ T cells in transplanted male mice in vivo. Taken together these novel findings indicate that an L-type Ca2+ channel plays a significant role in the Ca2+ influx pathways mediating T lymphocyte activation and proliferation in vitro and in vivo.","['Biomedical Research Centre, the Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia, 2222 Health Sciences Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.']",,,,,20030903,,,,,,,,

Minimally invasive biopsy techniques have been used for initial diagnosis of these disorders but their role has not been systematically evaluated in disease progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the yield of computed tomography (CT)-guided core needle biopsy in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and suspected disease progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of patients with known lymphoproliferative disorders who underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy during the course of their disease, between 1990 and 2002. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (91 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 21 with Hodgkin's disease, 10 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, six with combined malignancies and two with Castleman's disease) underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy 4.7 +/- 5.1 (standard deviation) (range 0-40) years after initial diagnosis. The procedure was diagnostic in 98 cases (75.4%). In 22 patients (17%) a subsequent open biopsy was performed, and in 10 (7.6%) the final diagnosis remained unconfirmed. Histological transformation was found in 20 cases (15.4%), of which 19 were suspected clinically. A new diagnosis (malignant and non-malignant) was apparent in 18 cases (13.9%) and relapsed or ongoing evidence of the original disease was found in 82 (63%). CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided core needle biopsy is a reliable procedure in patients with suspected histological transformation of lymphoproliferative disorders, and should be used as the initial tool for pathological re-evaluation.","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transient expression studies, negative regulation was reported to be conferred by coexpression of the transcription factor YY1, which binds to a motif in the upstream conserved region (UCR). To address the function of the UCR and its YY1-motif in an in vivo model of MLV-host interactions we introduced six consecutive triple basepair mutations into this region of the potent T-lymphomagenic SL3-3 MLV. We report that all mutants have retained their replication competence and that they all, like the SL3-3 wild type (wt), induce T-cell lymphomas when injected into newborn mice of the SWR strain. However, all mutants induced disease with slightly shorter latency periods than the wt SL3-3, suggesting that the YY1 motif as well as its immediate context in the UCR have a negative effect on the pathogenicity of the virus. This result may have implications for the design of retroviral vectors.","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biotech. 18 (2000), 176; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 300 (2003), 115). To help understand this nonhomologous DNA recombination event, we constructed another vector, AdELP-luc, with 2.7 kb of MoMLV elements identically placed into an E1-deleted adenovirus type 5 backbone upstream of a luciferase cDNA reporter gene. Unlike AdLTR-luc, no MoMLV elements were placed downstream of the expression cassette. AdELP-luc readily infected epithelial cells in vitro. Southern hybridizations with DNA from cloned cells showed that disruption of the MoMLV sequences occurred. One cell clone, grown in vitro without any special selection medium for 9 months, exhibited stable vector integration and luciferase activity. Importantly, both Southern hybridization and FISH analyses showed that in addition to the MoMLV elements and expression cassette, substantial adenoviral sequence downstream of the luciferase cDNA was genomically integrated. These results suggest that the 2.7 kb of MoMLV sequence included in AdELP-luc have cis-acting functions and mediates an unusual integration event.","['Gene Therapy and Therapeutics Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1190, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An examination of the serum levels and the activities of proteins C and S demonstrated a slight decrease in the protein C level but an undetectable protein C activity. The patient received the diagnosis of homozygous protein C deficiency, because both parents were found to have heterozygous protein C activity. Treatment of the patient's leukemia included induction chemotherapy (Ara-C and idarubicin) with concomitant administration of low molecular weight heparin for his homozygous protein C deficiency. He achieved a complete remission without expressing any thrombosis during the course of chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case ever described in which acute myeloid leukemia was complicated with homozygous protein C deficiency.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. shimamtt@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 156 patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or very severe AA treated with ISA (antithymocyte globulin [ATG] or ATG plus cyclosporine), 46.8% showed complete or partial response and 7.1% had relapses. After long-term follow-up, 1 case each of acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria developed. The 6-year survival rate was 69%. Response to ISA, disease severity, and low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (< or = 200/mm3) were associated with poor survival.

Twenty (31.3%) of the patients developed grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 12 (18.8%) of the patients developed chronic GVHD. The 6-year survival rate was 79%. Patient age and sex, disease severity, etiology, ANC, initial platelet count, and treatment regimen did not affect survival. Survival of 83 AA patients, aged 14 to 40 years, treated with ISA was not statistically significant from that of 61 adult AA patients who underwent BMT (6-year survival rate, 65% and 79%, respectively). However, BMT in adult AA achieved long-term engraftment and a lower relapse rate than ISA. These results suggest that ISA can achieve a high response rate and long-term survival among patients with adult AA, regardless of disease severity.

Four transcription factors control B-cell differentiation into plasma cells. The B-cell transcription factor pax-5 is mainly responsible for a B-cell phenotype, and bcl-6 represses the plasma cell transcription factor blimp-1 and plasma cell differentiation. bcl-6 expression is triggered by CD40 and IL-4 activation. A lack of CD40 and IL-4 activation yields a down-regulation of bcl-6 expression, and IL-6 stimulation yields an up-regulation of blimp-1, mainly through STAT3 activation. Blimp-1 further down-regulates bcl-6 and pax-5 expression and makes plasma cell differentiation possible. IL-6 as well as IL-10 up-regulate XBP-1. XBP-1 is another transcription factor that is involved in plasma cell differentiation and whose gene expression is shut down by pax-5. The plasma cell transcription factors blimp-1 and XBP-1 are up-regulated, and the B-cell transcription factors bcl-6 and pax-5 are down-regulated, in malignant cells compared to B-cells. Apart from the recent identification of these 4 transcription factors, the factors involved in normal plasma cell generation are mostly unknown. Regarding malignant plasma cells, 3 categories of growth factors have been identified: (1) the IL-6 family cytokines, IL-10, and interferon alpha that activate the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways; (2) growth factors activating the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase/AKT and MAP kinase pathways, unlike the JAK/STAT pathway (insulin-like growth factor 1, hepatocyte growth factor, and members of the epidermal growth factor family able to bind syndecan-1 proteoglycan); and (3) B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) or proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) that activate the nuclear factor KB and PI-3 kinase/AKT pathways. BAFF and APRIL bind to BAFF receptor and TACI and are major B-cell survival factors. Recent data indicate that these various growth factors may cooperate to provide optimum signaling because they are localized together and with cytoplasmic transduction elements in caveolinlinked membrane caveolae. The identification of these myeloma cell growth factors and of the associated transduction pathways should provide novel therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.","['INSERM U475 and Unit for Cellular and Gene Therapy, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France. klein@montp.inserm.fr']",,81,,,,,,,['HALMS130900'],,,,

The gene mutated in this disease, ATRX, encodes a plant homeodomain-like finger and a SWI2/SNF2-like ATPase motif, both of which are often found in chromatin-remodeling enzymes, but ATRX has not been characterized biochemically. By immunoprecipitation from HeLa extract, we found that ATRX is in a complex with transcription cofactor Daxx. The following evidence supports that ATRX and Daxx are components of an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex: (i) Daxx and ATRX can be coimmunoisolated by antibodies specific for each protein; (ii) a proportion of Daxx cofractionates with ATRX as a complex of 1 MDa by gel-filtration analysis; (iii) in extract from cells of a patient with ATRX syndrome, the level of the Daxx-ATRX complex is correspondingly reduced; (iv) a proportion of ATRX and Daxx colocalize in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, with which Daxx had previously been located; and (v) the ATRX complex displays ATP-dependent activities that resemble those of other chromatin-remodeling complexes, including triple-helix DNA displacement and alteration of mononucleosome disruption patterns. But unlike the previously described SWI/SNF or NURD complexes, the ATRX complex does not randomize DNA phasing of the mononucleosomes, suggesting that it may remodel chromatin differently. Taken together, the results suggest that ATRX functions in conjunction with Daxx in a novel chromatin-remodeling complex.

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we found that GBS infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) induced a highly specific and coordinate set of genes including IL-8, Groalpha, Grobeta, IL-6, GM-CSF, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1), and ICAM-1, which act to orchestrate neutrophil recruitment, activation, and enhanced survival. Most strikingly, infection with a GBS strain lacking beta-h/c resulted in a marked reduction in expression of genes involved in the immune response, while the unencapsulated strain generally induced similar or greater expression levels for the same subset of genes. Cell-free bacterial supernatants containing beta-h/c activity induced IL-8 release, identifying this toxin as a principal provocative factor for BBB activation. These findings were further substantiated in vitro and in vivo. Neutrophil migration across polar HBMEC monolayers was stimulated by GBS and its beta-h/c through a process involving IL-8 and ICAM-1.

We demonstrate here that primary myeloid progenitors immortalized by various MLL oncoproteins exhibit a characteristic Hoxa gene cluster expression profile, which reflects that preferentially expressed in the myeloid clonogenic progenitor fraction of normal bone marrow. Continued maintenance of this MLL-dependent Hoxa gene expression profile is associated with conditional MLL-associated myeloid immortalization. Moreover, Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 were specifically required for efficient in vitro myeloid immortalization by an MLL fusion protein but not other leukemogenic fusion proteins.

Thus, a genetic reliance on Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 in MLL-mediated transformation demonstrates a gain-of-function mechanism for MLL oncoproteins as upstream constitutive activators that promote myeloid transformation via a Hox-dependent mechanism.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA055029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,20030902,,,,,,,,

This is thought to be due to apoptosis of hematopoietic bone marrow cells, resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) B1 is involved in pre-mRNA processing and binds to telomeric cDNA repeats. The hnRNP B1 is a marker for early cancer. The aim of our study was to clarify the relationships between prognosis and apoptosis, telomerase activity (TA) and hnRNP expression in the bone marrow. The subjects were 51 patients with MDS, including patients with refractory anemia (RA) (n = 32), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (n = 1), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n = 7), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) (n = 8) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) (n = 3). We also studied 6 cases with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) arising from MDS (AML-MDS) and 10 control subjects. Bone marrow biopsies were stained immunohistochemically for caspase-3 (marker of apoptotic activity) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and hnRNP B1. Fatal pancytopenia was the cause of death in 19 of the 51 patients. The caspase-3 positive cell rate was higher in MDS (16.3%) than in controls (4.4%) and AML-MDS (0.5%). The percentage of hnRNP B1-positive cells was higher in MDS (15.3%) and AML-MDS (56.3%) than in controls (5.6%). In MDS, hnRNP B1 levels were higher in RAEB and RAEB-t subtypes than in RA and RARS. The percentage of hTERT-positive cells was higher in AML-MDS (50.0%) than in controls (20.2%) and MDS (23.6%). Our findings suggest that activation of apoptosis occurs in MDS in the absence of hTERT expression, implicating high apoptosis in the absence of high TA with ineffective hematopoiesis. Poor prognosis correlated with higher caspase-3 and lower hTERT rates. In MDS, hnRNP B1 activity may be associated with leukemic transformation.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonanku, Fukuoka 814-01, Japan. ohshima@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and twelve patients were analysed using FISH with LSI bcr-abl dual ES color probes, at the moment of the diagnosis when possible or, if not, on a sample with a strong rate of Ph+ metaphases evaluated by conventional cytogenetics. When the deletion was highlighted in a patient, we performed an hybridization on all the samples available during the follow-up. The deletion of the 5' region of the gene abl was detected among 9 patients. When the deletion was found in a patient, it was present in all the Ph+ metaphases and nuclei and in all the samples studied at diagnosis and during follow up. In these patients, we never identified cells carrying the Ph chromosome translocation without the deletion. None of the patients with the deletion had a major cytogenetic response to treatment with interferon. The deletion of the 5'abl region on der(9), present in approximately 9% of the CML, takes place at the same time as the formation of the Ph chromosome translocation and seems of worse prognosis. The detection of this deletion could thus constitute an argument to start STI treatment in first intent for these patients.","[""Laboratoire d'Histologie, Embryologie et Cyotgenetique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of recipients were children with an average weight of 20kg, however, more than 500 UCB transplantations (UCBT) have already been performed in adults. The ""naive"" nature of UCB lymphocytes may explain the lower incidence and severity of graft vs. host disease (GvHD) encountered in UCBT compared to the allogeneic transplant setting. Furthermore, UCB is rich in primitive CD16-CD56++ NK cells, which possess significant proliferative and cytotoxic capacities and can be expanded using IL-12 or IL-15, so as to mount a substantial graft vs. leukemia (GvL) effect. The major disadvantage of UCB is the low yield of stem cells, resulting in higher rates of engraftment failure and slower time to engraftment compared to bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

The clinical course of this disease is heterogeneous, with some patients progressing rapidly with early death whilst others exhibit a more stable, possibly, non-progressing disease lasting many years. Despite progress in therapy, relapse invariably occurs and the disease remains incurable. The clinical management of CLL is therefore challenging and considerable effort has been directed towards novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the disease relapse rate. Recent insights into the role of dendritic cells as the pivotal antigen-presenting cells that initiate immune responses may provide the basis for generating more effective antitumor immune responses. Consequently, dendritic cells constitute an attractive approach in the context of CLL. However, understanding the relation between dendritic cells and the cellular immune response is crucial to elucidation of how to manipulate immune responses. After summarizing general properties of dendritic cells, this review focus on the approaches exploiting monocyte-derived dendritic cells in CLL, which should help design of novel treatment strategies in this disease.","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris Cedex 15, France. vuillier@pasteur.fr""]",,58,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, MDS evolves from an early phase of accelerated apoptosis resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis to a later phase of increasing proliferation with maturation arrest. Afflicted patients experience a deteriorating course characterized by peripheral cytopenia(s) with consequent infection and hemorrhage and, in some cases, progression to acute leukemia. The classification of MDS has been a matter of some controversy, perhaps allied to our largely unsatisfactory insights into the pathobiology of the disease. Recently, however, new concepts have emerged to explain the etiology and pathogenesis of MDS that invoke a model for step-wise genetic progression with modulation by the immune system and the marrow microenvironment. From these insights into its cellular and molecular pathogenesis have emerged new strategies for both diagnosis and treatment. With the implementation of these strategies, it is anticipated that a more rational and objective approach to the diagnosis and classification of MDS may be achieved, affording the use of more effective targeted therapy.","['Dept of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 7.103 Founders Pavilion, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4283, USA.']",,153,,,,,,,,,,,

Five monoclonal antibodies--rituximab, trastuzumab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, alemtuzumab, and ibritumomab tiuxetan--are available for clinical use. Rituximab is active against indolent lymphomas, providing a valuable alternative for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP) increased survival over CHOP alone in patients with high-grade lymphomas. Trastuzumab has significant activity against HER-2-positive breast cancer, especially in combination with paclitaxel or an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an active second-line therapy in older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, but its role in combination regimens is unclear. Alemtuzumab is a valuable option for salvage therapy of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibritumomab tiuxetan delivers radioactive isotopes to tumor cells and is active against indolent lymphomas in patients who have relapsed after chemotherapy or rituximab therapy. The most common adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies are myelosuppression, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Rituximab may cause tumor lysis syndrome, arrhythmias, and pulmonary dysfunction. Alemtuzumab causes immunosuppression, increasing the risk of infection. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin may cause hepatotoxicity, and trastuzumab may cause significant pulmonary or cardiac toxicity. Investigational monoclonal antibodies include edrecolomab and tositumomab.

Case 1 was a male patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for which initial right hepatectomy was followed by left hepatectomy 5 months later for recurrent HCC. The postoperative course following second surgery was complicated by severe methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis, mild azotaemia and subacute cholestatic liver failure. MARS was used thrice in this patient. Case 2 was a female patient with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) acute haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) secondary to cyclosporin A (Cy A), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, severe nosocomial pneumonia, acute renal failure (ARF) treated with continuous haemofiltration and acute veno-occlusive disease resulting in Budd-Chiari syndrome. The latter precipitated ALF. MARS was instituted twice. Case 3 was a male patient with advanced, refractory Hodgkin's disease previously treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy. ALF developed secondary to acute viral hepatitis B flare. He was given a trial of MARS once in the ICU. All the three patients eventually died. RESULTS: Mean MARS intradialytic systemic pressures were as follows: systolic pressure range was 95 +/- 17 to 128 +/- 17 mmHg and diastolic pressure range was 51 +/- 5 to 67 +/- 7 mmHg. Pressure at albumin dialysate exit point from dialyser 1 (Ae) ranged from 253 +/- 11 to 339 +/- 15 mmHg and that at albumin dialysate entry point into dialyser 1 (Aa) ranged from 142 +/- 11 to 210 +/- 6 mmHg. Ultrafiltration (UF) was 633 +/- 622 mL over mean treatment duration of 6.3 +/- 0.9 h with a total heparin dose of 1583 +/- 817 IU. Coagulation status pre- and 6-h post-MARS was similar: aPTT (P=0.116) and platelet count (P=0.753). There were no bleeding complications or circuit thromboses. MARS had a significant de-uraemization effect (pre- and post-MARS serum creatinine and urea: P=0.046 and 0.028, respectively) but did not significantly attenuate blood lactate, ammonia or total bilirubin levels. Albumin dialysate (Ae - Aa) urea and creatinine concentrations appeared to be sharply attenuated after 6 h of MARS. In contrast, the removal of total bilirubin by albumin dialysate from the blood compartment appeared to plateau after 4 h of continuous MARS operation. CONCLUSIONS: MARS was well-tolerated in critically ill patients with advanced and complicated cancer. Low-dose heparin was safe and did not compromise MARS circuit integrity. Although MARS had a significant de-uraemization effect, this appeared to be limited by the duration of MARS operation. Our data suggested that such a limit was reached earlier for total bilirubin. More data are needed to confirm the present findings and further delineate the saturation limit of MARS for different toxins that accumulate in ALF. This would affect the optimal duration of MARS therapy.","['Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. hankhim@lycos.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of non-C. albicans fungemia decreased from 63 (33.3%) during the first 5 years (1991-1995) to 31 (16.4%) episodes during the second 5 years. Moreover, no fungemia due to C. glabrata and C. krusei were observed during the last 3 years. Overall, during the years of the study, a decreasing incidence of yeast fungemia was observed. Fungemia occurred more frequently in patients with leukemia (24%), prematurity (16%), postsurgery (10.6%), and lymphoma (9.5%). Patients with respiratory infections and preterm infants more often had C. albicans fungemia, whereas C. tropicalis predominated in patients with hepatic disorders and leukemia.

Theoretically, the number of (pre-meiotic) mitotic cell divisions during spermatogenesis and their remarkable increase with ageing compared with oogenesis would be in favour of genetic risks for the offspring of older men. But for numerical and structural chromosomal anomalies, such an influence of paternal age has not been found. However, in several autosomal dominant disorders affecting three specific genes (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and 3, RET proto-oncogene) the risk for a child to be affected increases with paternal age at time of birth. For other autosomal dominant -X chromosomal dominant or recessive disorders, the available data are sufficient to support the concept of a positive relationship between paternal age and de novo gene mutations. Studies analysing gene sequences of affected children and their parents would allow further evaluation of this topic. The impact of paternal age on disorders with a complex genetic background, however, is a matter of debate. A significant effect of paternal age could not be shown for nonfamilial Alzheimer's disease, congenital heart defects, nonfamilial schizophrenia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or prostate cancer.","['Centre of Dermatology and Andrology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.

RESULTS: The study identified 44 patients with T-cell LGLL and 14 with natural killer-cell LGLL. The two disorders were similar in sex and age distribution of patients; peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts; and incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Among the two groups, patients with the T-cell LGLL presented with significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations (P < 0.04) and a higher frequency of palpable splenomegaly (P < 0.01).

From October 1997 to November 2001, 51 consecutive, previously untreated patients with stage IIA (bulky), IIB, III, and IV disease were treated with a modified baseline BEACOPP regimen with the etoposide administered i.v. on day 1 and orally at a dose of 100 mg/m2, on days 2 and 3. Each patient was scheduled to receive eight courses of BEACOPP with consolidation radiotherapy to bulky (> or =5 cm) or residual disease. There were 25 males and 26 females with a median age of 32 yr (16-65 yr); 80.3% of the patients had nodular sclerosis HD, 41% had bulky disease (> or =5 cm), 10 were in stage IIA (bulky > or =10 cm), 15 in stage IIB, 19 in stage III, and seven in stage IV. Thirty-seven patients (72.5%) achieved a complete response and 17.6% partial response. No significant difference in overall response rate was observed between patients with: (i) 0-2 vs. > or =3 negative prognostic factors, (ii) in stage II vs. stages III/IV, LDH level, and bulky disease. With a median follow up period of 39.5 months, actuarial 3-yr survival rate is 82% and time to progression rate 72.5%. Treatment with this combination was well tolerated. Grades 3 and 4 leukopenia and neutropenia occured in 26% and 28% of the patients, respectively, whereas in 16.3% of the patients infection was observed. Support with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given to 59% of the patients. No case of secondary MDS/leukemia has been observed. The results of the present study demonstrate that the modified baseline BEACOPP regimen with radiotherapy used in our patients was well tolerated and effective therapy for intermediate and advanced stage HD. Further follow up time is required to evaluate long-term toxicity.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine - Propaedeutic, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens University, Athens, Greece. economopoulosth@ath.forthnet.gr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of eight patients were enrolled, seven with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS) and one with large-cell transformation of MF. Seven patients had disease refractory to multiple previous therapies. Alemzumab (30 mg) was administered intravenously three times per week for 12 wk or until maximum response. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 38%, with three patients achieving partial remission, two patients with stable disease and three patients with progressive disease (PD) during treatment. The time to progression was short, with all patients developing PD within 4 months of starting alemtuzumab. Response duration in the three PR patients was also brief, with responses lasting less than 3 months in all three cases. Significant hematological and immunosuppressive toxicity was observed, with both grade 3-4 cytopenias and significant infectious complications occurring in a majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in heavily pretreated, refractory, advanced stage MF/SS, although alemtuzumab has biological activity, it is associated with significant toxicity and only modest clinical utility. As such, combination regimens incorporating alemtuzumab merit further investigation in this difficult to treat patient group.","['Haematology Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six of 15 (40%) informative cases had LOH in chromosome 17 in small cells, and eight (53%) showed LOH in large cells. Eleven of 19 informative cases (61.1%) showed LOH in chromosome 20 in large cells, and eight (42.1%) showed LOH in small cells. RS cases with LOH at chromosome 20 were associated with marginally shorter survival rates (P = 0.08). Our data suggest that there are significant molecular differences between large and small cells in patients with CLL. Further analysis of the genes on these chromosomes may provide new insight into our understanding of the transformation of small CLL cells to large (Richter) cells.","['Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

To study the mechanism underlying nucleotide selection, we synthesized four nucleotide analogues bearing the unnatural bases benzimidazole, 5-nitrobenzimidazole, 6-nitrobenzimidazole, and 5-nitroindole and analyzed their incorporation by three DNA polymerases. We have found that human DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (KF) incorporate all four nucleotide analogues opposite all four canonical bases up to 4000-fold more efficiently than an incorrect natural dNTP (i.e., rates that approach those of a correct, natural dNTP), even though the shape of any base pair formed between the analogue and the template likely does not resemble a normal base pair. While pol alpha preferentially incorporated the analogues opposite template pyrimidines, KF surprisingly preferred to polymerize them opposite template purines. Although neither pol alpha nor KF readily polymerized a natural dNTP opposite either 5- or 6-nitrobenzimidazole in the template strand, the enzymes did incorporate the analogues to generate novel base pairs. Both pol alpha and KF polymerized the analogues up to 140-fold more efficiently than dATP both across from abasic sites and as 3'-overhangs on blunt-ended templates. Although Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase did not measurably incorporate the analogues, this enzyme bound the analogues with K(I)'s only slightly higher than the K(m) for polymerization of the normal dNTP. The implications of these results with respect to how polymerases discriminate between correct and incorrect dNTPs are discussed.","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309, USA.']",,,['GM54194/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

As PML is important for controlling major cellular processes, such as growth and differentiation, it is believed that it plays an important role during human gestation. The human placenta is a critical organ for the maintenance of gestation, but the expression pattern and functional significance of PML in the placenta have not been documented. The present study has therefore investigated the expression of PML in the human placenta and in choriocarcinoma, and has observed the biological effects following the overexpression of PML in choriocarcinoma cell lines (BeWo and JEG-3). In the human placenta, PML expression was readily found in villous stromal fibroblasts, capillary endothelial cells, Hofbauer cells, and occasionally in amnion cells. Moreover, immunoblotting of placental lysates demonstrated increased PML expression with increasing gestation. Interestingly, PML expression was confined to intermediate trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells at the placental site (placental site giant cells) in the trophoblastic cell population. Intermediate trophoblasts at non-placental sites, and villous cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts consistently did not express PML. Further screening of PML expression in hydatidiform moles (n = 4) and choriocarcinomas (n = 7) also revealed selective PML expression in intermediate trophoblastic cells and syncytiotrophoblastic cells, but not in the cytotrophoblastic populations, which corresponds well with observations in the placental bed. Adenoviral transduction of PML resulted in a marked reduction in cell growth in both choriocarcinoma cell lines, which was associated with increased apoptosis. The findings of the present study strongly suggest that PML plays an important role in human placental development and growth, and in the pathobiology of trophoblasts and trophoblastic neoplasia.","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. cjkim@plaza.snu.ac.kr']","['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the future, diagnostic procedures may include oligonucleotide microarray analysis (MA) to detect expression patterns of large numbers of specific genes. METHODS: For comparison between methods, we performed FC and MA by using the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133A microarray in parallel and correlated protein expression levels and mRNA abundance of 39 relevant genes in 113 patients with newly diagnosed AML and ALL and four normal bone marrow samples. RESULTS: In 1,512 of 2,187 (69.1%) comparisons between methods, congruent results were obtained with regard to positivity or negativity of expression, respectively. Specifically, there was a significant correlation between protein expression and mRNA abundance for genes essential for diagnosing and subclassifying AML and ALL with regard to positivity and expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that protein expression is highly correlated to mRNA abundance in AML and ALL. Further, expression patterns of specific genes provide important information at diagnosis for patients with AML and ALL that may be used for the discrimination from other leukemias.","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, University Hospital Grosshadern, Department of Internal Medicine III, Munich, Germany. wolfgang.kern@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to evaluate whether the combined use of Syto16, the Pgp blocker PSC833, and 7-AAD allows simultaneous detection of all parameters, with emphasis on applications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Pgp negative/positive KB cell lines treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha/hyperthermia and frozen-thawed AML samples were used as apoptosis/Pgp models. RESULTS: For the accurate assessment of apoptosis in samples with unknown Pgp status, it was essential to include a sample with PSC833: in such samples, viable cells always show a Syto16(high) and apoptotic cells a Syto16(low) fluorescence. Apoptotic cells loose their Pgp activity early on; in Pgp-positive cells, the Syto16(low) apoptotic cells then colocalize with the Syto16(low) viable cells in the situation minus PSC833. We have developed a gating strategy that, apart from quantifying apoptosis, allowed gating out these apoptotic cells for proper Pgp assessment. By using this strategy, no differences in Pgp activity were found in the treated versus the untreated samples (KB cells: P = 0.779, n = 10; AML cells: P = 0.525, n = 45). CONCLUSIONS: The use of the combination Syto16/PSC833/7-AAD provides a sensitive multiparameter flow cytometry method that enables accurate assessment of both apoptosis, cell death, and Pgp function in clinical samples.","['Department of Hematology VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistently effective treatments have not been developed for this malignancy. The present report describes two elderly patients with widespread blastic NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma involving the skin, bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and viscera. In both cases the malignant cells were CD56+, CD2+, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) positive with no detectable T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma chain gene rearrangement. The cells also exhibited a low CD45 expression and strong CD99 (mic-2) expression, as seen in immature lymphoid malignancies. The above findings support the precursor NK-cell, rather than mature NK- or non-NK-cell, origin of the malignant cells. It is noteworthy that the two patients achieved complete responses to treatment with hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) alternating with high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine, a regimen currently utilized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and high-grade lymphoma. The complete remission (CR) was sustained for 24 months in one patient who received four cycles (eight courses) of the treatment. It lasted 9 months in the second patient, who received only two cycles (four courses). If similar results are obtained with future patients, a randomized study comparing the hyper-CVAD regimen to other therapeutic strategies may be warranted.","['Department of Dermatology, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania Health System, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['R01-CA89194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The concordance of diagnosis for DIC by ISTH and JMHW was significantly high in patients with trauma or acute promyelocytic leukemia. About 70% of DIC or overt DIC patients had more than 1 point in the scoring system for prothrombin time, but >50% of those patients had 0 point for plasma fibrinogen level. Abnormal fibrin and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) levels and platelet counts were observed in >88% of DIC and overt DIC patients but were observed in >50% of non-DIC patients, indicating that these parameters are sensitive markers but not specific markers for the diagnosis of DIC.

We conducted an observational study of the epidemiology, clinical presentation and significance of autoimmune complications of CLL/SLL in 132 patients from a large population (>45,000 veterans), in which at least 90% of patients with CLL/SLL have been previously identified. Over a period of 12.5 years, 12 patients (9.1%) had autoimmune complications; of these, 6 (4.5%) had autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), 5 (3.8%) had immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and 1 (0.8%) had pure red blood cell aplasia (PRBA). All 6 cases of AIHA had a positive direct immunoglobulin test for IgG and C3d. In 6 patients, CLL/SLL was an incidental finding at the time of presentation with autoimmune cytopenia. Nine out of 10 patients responded to immunosuppressive therapy, which was complicated by serious infection in 7 cases, one of which was fatal. The major cause of mortality in patients with autoimmune complications of CLL/SLL was secondary malignancy. Survival of patients with immune cytopenia was not significantly different from CLL/SLL patients without immune cytopenia. Among patients with anemia or thrombocytopenia, mortality was significantly higher in those with bone marrow failure compared to an autoimmune etiology. We show that in a non-referred population with a high incidence of CLL/SLL, autoimmune cytopenia can occur early in the natural history of the disease. These data suggest that the Rai and Binet classifications for CLL need to be modified for patients with autoimmune cytopenia. .","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional design. SETTING: Two pediatric oncology treatment centers. SAMPLE: 47 children and adolescents who had been receiving ALL therapy for at least one year or who were off therapy for no more than three years and their parents and teachers. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) data were available on a subset of 17 subjects. METHODS: Parent, teacher, and self-report Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC) ratings were used to measure behavioral adjustment. WISC-R measured cognitive abilities, and WRAT-R measured academic abilities. Demographic, family, and treatment-related data also were collected. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Behavioral adjustment and cognitive and academic abilities. FINDINGS: At least 20% of teacher ratings for somatization, learning problems, leadership, and study skills; parent ratings for somatization, adaptability, attention problems, withdrawal, anxiety, social skills, and depression; and self-report ratings for anxiety and attitude to school were in the at-risk range (i.e., presence of significant problems that require treatment). The majority of teacher BASC ratings were correlated significantly with WISC-R and WRAT-R scores. Self-report depression and social stress ratings were correlated significantly with some WISC-R and WRAT-R scores. Treatment-related experiences such as body image alterations and mental and emotional problems were associated with problematic behaviors, including depression, somatization, withdrawal, and social stress. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with ALL are at risk for some behavioral adjustment problems, particularly anxiety, somatization, adaptability, attention, and withdrawal. Cognitive and academic abilities are associated with some dimensions of behavioral adjustment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings suggest the need for ongoing assessment of behavioral adjustment and cognitive and academic abilities of children with ALL. Behavioral interventions that target at-risk mannerisms, such as somatization, depression, anxiety, and social stress, are needed. Central nervous system treatment may contribute to behavioral adjustment problems, as well as to cognitive and academic problems. Strategies to improve academic abilities also may have a positive effect on behavioral adjustment.","['Division of Nursing Practice for the College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA. kmoore@nursing.arizona.edu']",,,"['HD37816/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'NR02557/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'NR04905/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Their cellular target is the beta-tubulin subunit of alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimers, and they act to inhibit cell division by disrupting microtubule dynamics. Despite the effectiveness of these agents, drug resistance is a major clinical problem. To identify the underlying mechanisms behind vinca alkaloid resistance, we have performed high resolution differential proteome analysis. Treatment of drug-sensitive human leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) with vincristine identified numerous proteins involved in the cellular response to vincristine. In addition, differential protein expression was analyzed in leukemia cell lines selected for resistance to vincristine (CEM/VCR R) and vinblastine (CEM/VLB100). This combined proteomic approach identified 10 proteins altered in both vinca alkaloid response and resistance: beta-tubulin, alpha-tubulin, actin, heat shock protein 90beta, 14-3-3tau, 14-3-3epsilon, L-plastin, lamin B1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-F, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-K. Several of these proteins have not previously been associated with drug resistance and are thus novel targets for elucidation of resistance mechanisms. In addition, seven of these proteins are associated with the tubulin and/or actin cytoskeletons. This study provides novel insights into the interrelationship between the microtubule and microfilament systems in vinca alkaloid resistance.","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, High St. (P.

PTP-oc has been assumed to be a truncated variant of GLEPP1, resulting from alternative splicing. However, the 5'-untranslated region sequence of PTP-oc mRNA contains 217 bp from an intron of GLEPP1. There are no splicing acceptor sites at the PTP-oc transcription site. The intronic sequence flanking the 5' end of the PTP-oc transcription start site contains potential promoter elements essential for transcriptional initiation. To test the hypothesis that the PTP-oc gene has an alternative, tissue-specific, intronic promoter, the promoter activity of a 1.3-kb PCR fragment covering the 5'-flanking region of the PTP-oc gene was measured. The putative PTP-oc promoter fragment showed strong promoter activity in U937 cells. Mutation of the putative TATA box within the PTP-oc promoter abolished 60-90% of its promoter activity. The PTP-oc promoter fragment showed strong promoter activity in cells that express PTP-oc (U937 cells and RAW264.7 cells) but not in cells that do not express the enzyme (skin fibroblasts, TE85 cells, and HEK293 cells). These findings strongly support the conclusion that the 1.3-kb intronic fragment contains the tissue-specific, PTP-oc proximal promoter. Deletion and functional analyses indicate that the proximal 5' sequence flanking the TATA box of the PTP-oc contains potential repressor elements. The removal of the putative repressor elements led to the apparent loss of tissue specificity. In summary, we conclude that an intronic promoter within the GLEPP1 gene drives the expression of the PTP-oc in a cell type-specific manner. This GLEPP1/PTP-oc gene system is one of the very few systems in which two important tissue-specific enzymes are derived from the same gene by the use of alternative intronic promoters.","['Musculoskeletal Disease Center, Jerry L.

PERC exposure was assessed by collecting breathing zone samples on two consecutive days of a typical work week. PERC levels were measured in blood drawn on the morning of the second day of breathing zone sample collection in dry cleaners and before a typical workday in launderers. Blood PERC levels were two orders of magnitude higher in dry cleaners compared to launderers. A significant correlation was noted between time weighted average (TWA) PERC and blood PERC in dry cleaners (r=0.7355, P<0.002). 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), ng/mg deoxyguanosine (dG) in leukocyte nuclear DNA was used as an index of steady-state oxidative DNA damage.

Hypermethylation of calcitonin gene frequently implies malignancy transformation and is probably related to the progress of hematological malignancy tumors. However, studies on the significance of hypermethylation of calcitonin gene in the diagnosis and treatment of myelogenous leukemia were rarely reported. This study was designed to investigate the value of analyzing hypermethylation of the calcitonin gene for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) and monitoring disease evolution in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia(CML). METHODS: Digestion of DNA with Hpa II in combination with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine the methylation patterns of the calcitonin gene in 31 cases with AML, 45 cases with CML (including 33 patients in chronic phase, 2 in accelerated phase, and 10 in blast crisis), and 14 healthy adults (used as control). RESULTS: The hypermethylation of calcitonin gene was found in 25 of 31 cases with AML (80.6%), 0 of 14 healthy adults (0%) (P< 0.01). Follow-up study of 5 cases with AML showed that 4 cases who appeared hypermethylation of calcitonin gene at both diagnosis and complete remission relapsed 3, 5, 6, and 14 months respectively after complete remission; the other case without hypermethylation of calcitonin gene did not relapse 25 months after complete remission. Among 45 cases with CML, 3 of 33 in chronic phase, 2 of 2 in accelerated phase and 8 of 10 in blast crisis showed hypermethylation of calcitonin gene; there were significant differences between chronic phase group and blast crisis group (including accelerated phase) (P< 0.01); three cases with CML in chronic phase developed into blast crisis 10, 12, and 13 months after hypermethylation of calcitonin gene were detected. CONCLUSION: Analyzing hypermethylation of calcitonin gene may be useful in assessing the prognosis of AML and monitoring disease evolution in CML.","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China. xhxlyy@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to explore the sensitivity and specificity of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) technique in monitoring the tumor load of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during treatment. METHODS: Ten cases of normal bone marrow cells were examined using I-FISH technique to define the normal cut-off value. Bone marrow cells from 20 CML patients in treatment were assayed with I-FISH, conventional cytogenetic G-banding (CCG) analysis, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The tumor load was monitored in a quantitative way. RESULTS: The false-positive bone marrow cells were 0.6%-2.0% in control group by I-FISH; the normal cut-off value was 2.45%. Among 20 CML patients after being treated with IFN-alpha or bone marrow transplantation, Ph(+) clone were detected in 9 cases by CGG with positive cell rate ranging from 16.7% to 100%. However, combining with the cutoff value, bcr-abl(+) cells were found in 16/20(80%) cases by I-FISH with positive cell rate ranging from 2.8% to 99.6%. These 16 patients were assayed with RT-PCR, and 13(81.3%) among them showed bcr-abl mRNA positive. CONCLUSION: I-FISH can be used as a sensitive and specific tool to monitor the change of tumor load in CML during treatment; meanwhile, the results acquired from I-FISH would be more accurate than that from CCG and RT-PCR.","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, The First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Drug resistance profiles were determined in 202 children (aged 1 to 18 years) with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated according to the German Cooperative Study Group for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (COALL)-92 protocol. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 6.2 years (range, 4.1 to 9.3 years), the 5-year disease-free survival probability (pDFS) rate +/- SE was 69% +/- 7.0%, 83% +/- 4.4%, and 84% +/- 6.8% for patients with resistant (PVA score 7 to 9), intermediate-sensitive (PVA score 5 to 6), and sensitive (SPVA score 3 to 4) profiles, respectively (sensitive and intermediate-sensitive v resistant, P </=.05). Resistant patients were at increased risk of an early event (nonresponse or relapse within 2.5 years of diagnosis) compared with sensitive and intermediate-sensitive patients (P =.03). The profile did not identify patients at higher risk of late relapse, which was also observed for DCLSG ALL-VII/VIII patients now analyzed at a median of 7.5 years of follow-up (range, 4.4 to 10.8 years). Despite being nondiscriminative for late relapses, the resistant profile was still the strongest prognostic factor for COALL-92 patients in a multivariate analysis including known risk factors (P =.07). CONCLUSION: Drug resistance profiles identify patients at higher risk of early treatment failures and may, therefore, be used to improve risk-group stratification of children with ALL.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, PO Box 2060, 3000 CB Rotterdam, The Netherlands. m.l.denboer@erasmusmc.nl.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 42%, all original Ig and/or TCR sequences were conserved. In 24%, one original sequence was preserved but the other lost, and in 14% the original sequences were conserved with new sequences identified at relapse.

When overexpressed in primary erythroblasts, FLI-1 converts erythropoietin (Epo)-induced terminal differentiation into a proliferative response. We found that SLAP, a gene encoding a recently described negative regulator of T-cell antigen receptor function during thymocyte development, is up-regulated both at the RNA and protein levels in FLI-1-transformed erythroblasts. Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) was found in a specific complex with erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), a cytokine receptor essential to erythroid differentiation. Constitutive expression of SLAP severely impairs hemoglobinization and late survival during Epo-induced terminal differentiation of erythroblasts. This impairment is associated with the specific inhibition of several critical Epo-dependent signaling events, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation and up-regulation of the expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-X gene. Our data support a model by which FLI-1 inhibits normal erythroid differentiation through the deregulation of genes encoding adaptors/effectors that modify the signaling output of cytokine receptors normally required for terminal differentiation.","['Institut Curie, Bat 110, Centre Universitaire, 91405 Orsay, France.']",,,,,20030828,,,,,,,,

These therapies target specific tumor cell receptors or signaling events that are critical to tumor progression while reducing toxicity to normal cells. DATA SOURCES: The purpose of this review is to highlight several examples of novel targeted therapeutics that are currently approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with cancer. Rituxan is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD20 antigen present on B cell lymphomas and is currently approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade CD20 positive follicular lymphoma. The humanized anti-HER-2/neu herceptin is approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer that demonstrates overexpression of HER-2/neu. Finally, Gleevec is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits abl-specific phosphorylation and is approved for use in select patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia that is refractory to interferon therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned from the use of these therapeutics will add to the growing knowledge of mechanistic approaches to the treatment of patients with cancer based upon targeted therapies, and herald a bright future that will improve the lives of patients with cancer.","['Department of General Surgery and Center for Cancer Drug Discovery and Development, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Desk A80, 9500 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. kimj@ccf.org']",,32,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective evidence of a myeloid stem cell neoplasm in the form of a clonal cytogenetic abnormality is provided in only 30% to 40% of the non-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) chronic MPDs (non-CML MPDs) and in a similar percentage of the MDSs. OBJECTIVE: To identify normal patterns of antigen expression during myeloid maturation and to determine whether flow cytometric evaluation of myeloid maturation represents an additional objective way to assess the likelihood of a stem cell neoplasm. DESIGN: We retrospectively evaluated 4-color flow cytometry data from more than 400 bone marrow aspirates obtained since 1998 from patients suspected of having a non-CML MPD or an MDS. RESULTS: Reproducible patterns of antigen expression were seen in normal myeloid maturation as well as in benign reactive settings such as marrow regeneration. In addition, we summarize data, presented in detail elsewhere, from a retrospective comparison of the sensitivity of flow cytometry with conventional cytogenetics for a large number of bone marrow aspirates on which both types of studies were performed. These data indicate that more than 90% of non-CML MPD and MDS cases with a clonal cytogenetic abnormality will be identified as abnormal by 4-color flow cytometry, and they therefore validate the use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In experienced laboratories, 4-color flow cytometry represents a valuable addition to the workup of non-CML MPDs and MDSs.","['University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seattle, Wash, USA. skussick@u.washington.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we examined the role of these antigenic regions on the proliferative response induced by hG-CSF on a myeloid leukaemia cell line. Both mAbs significantly inhibited the hG-CSF-induced cell growing, although epitope 8C2 but not 6E3 remained exposed in hG-CSF:cell receptor complexes. When cytokine:receptor complexes already formed at 4 degrees C were incubated 1 h at 37 degrees C under conditions preventing the internalization, a significant reduction in the amount of accessible 8C2 epitopes was evident. However, this effect was not observed when mAb 8C2:hG-CSF complexes previously bound to cells were incubated at 37 degrees C. Thus, results suggest that a receptor oligomerization process could account for the temperature-induced epitope 8C2 masking. The identification of epitope 8C2 accomplished by synthesis of overlapping octapeptides, revealed that it is formed by sequences 39-52 and 155-164, both in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of the hG-CSF molecule. Since part of this region has been proposed as a second binding site to receptors, we infer that the change of epitope 8C2 accessibility could be the result of either receptor aggregation or epitope binding to another receptor. In addition, our data support the hypothesis that a ligand-induced receptor oligomerization is required for transduction of cytokine signals.","['Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Instituto de Quimica y Fisicoquimica Biologicas (UBA-CONICET), Junin 956, 1113 Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this case-control study, associations were explored between specific medications as recorded in the medical records of 243 mothers of infants who were diagnosed with leukemia at < 18 months of age and 393 mothers ol infants without leukemia identified through random digit dialing. Cases included 157 acute lymphoblastic (ALL), 77 acute myeloid (AML), and nine other leukemias. A total of 27 different drugs that were prescribed for at least six women were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, non-statistically significant negative associations (Odds ratios, OR < 0.5) were observed with amoxicillin, nystatin, clomiphene, levothyroxine, cefaclor, and trimethobenzamide HCL. When cases were restricted to either myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia, cotrimoxazole was prescribed for five ALL case mothers and no matched controls; no association with cotrimoxazole was observed with AML. CONCLUSIONS: Given the number of comparisons, chance cannot be ruled out for any of the associations found here. However, a strength of this study is the lack of recall bias. The disparate data observed between AML and ALL in some instances may indicate areas of interest; they will be explored further in a case-control study of infant leukemia that is currently underway.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, USA. ross@epi.umn.edu']",,,"['R01 CA42479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA79940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not clear so far if these effects reflect a physiological function of the endogenous cytokines. Using fimbria-fornix transection as a model, we examined whether responses of GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons to axotomy are altered in mice lacking CNTF. In addition, we studied the cellular expression of CNTF, LIF and related cytokine receptor components in the septal complex following lesion. Degeneration of septohippocampal GABAergic neurons in the medial septum as indicated by the loss of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons was accelerated and permanently enhanced in CNTF(-/-) mice as compared to wild-type animals. Unexpectedly, the number of axotomized cholinergic MS neurons was significantly higher in CNTF-deficient mice during the first 2 weeks postlesion. Both in wild-type and in CNTF(-/-) mutants, expression of mRNA for the CNTF-specific alpha-subunit of the cytokine receptor complex was specifically upregulated in axotomized GABAergic septal neurons, whereas enhanced expression of the LIF-binding beta-subunit was specifically observed in axotomized cholinergic neurons. Following lesion, CNTF expression in wild-type mice was induced in activated astrocytes surrounding the axotomized neurons and at the lesion site. Expression of LIF mRNA was localized in the GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons. These results strongly indicate that endogenous CNTF, supplied by reactive glia cells, acts as a neuroprotective factor for axotomized CNS neurons. In the septum, endogenous CNTF specifically supports lesioned GABAergic projection neurons, whereas LIF may play a similar role for the cholinergic counterparts.","['Institute of Anatomy, University of Freiburg, Germany.

However, the miliary small nodule pattern commonly observed in low-grade B-cell lymphomas is practically never seen. In hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia, the pattern of splenic involvement is rather stereotyped, with diffuse red pulp infiltration and preservation of the sinus/pulp cord architecture, and without formation of nodules. The pattern of involvement is variable from case to case in peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified, and there can be associated prominent hemophagocytosis or a masking component of epithelioid granulomas. Aggressive NK cell leukemia and extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma show predominatly red pulp involvement, although the tumor cell density can vary from field to field; blood vessel walls are commonly infiltrated and there can be areas of necrosis.","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong, SAR, China. jkcchan@ha.org.hk']",,73,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was a clinical assessment of motor dexterity and sensory disturbances, as well as electroneurographic evaluation of sensory and motor fibers in the selected peripheral nerves and electromyographic assessment of patients after completed ALL treatment. MATERIAL: The study included 30 patients aged 6-23 years (17 girls and 13 boys), in whom ALL treatment employing the New York or BFM protocols had been terminated 0.3-11 years earlier. METHODS: Each patient was subjected to a neurological examination in the course of treatment and to a follow-up neurological assessment after therapy completion. Electro-neurography (ENG) and electromyography (EMG) were also performed in all subjects. RESULTS: Clinical signs of polyneuropathy associated with chemotherapy were noted in 13 patients (43.3%) and in 11 subject (36.7%) in follow-up. Only three patients did not manifest any abnormal electro-neurophysiological signs. Electroneurographic and electromyographic abnormalities were more intense following the New York protocol in comparison to the BFM protocol and in the majority of patients were dependent on the cumulated vincristine dose. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical signs of polyneuropathy were seen in 43.3% of children on chemotherapy for ALL and in 36.7% of subjects in follow-up. Ninety per cent of patients demonstrated abnormal electroneuro-physiological signs in consequence of ALL therapy. In all patients with abnormal EMG (63.3%) muscle reinnervation was detected.","['Klinika Neurologii Dzieciecej CM UJ 30-663 Krakow, ul. Wielicka 265. neupedkr@cm-uj.krakow.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify proteins specifically expressed in leukemias, here we isolated AC133(+) hematopoietic stem cell-like fractions from the bone marrow of 13 individuals with various leukemic disorders, and compared their protein profiles by two-dimensional electrophoresis. A total of 11 differentially expressed protein spots corresponding to 10 independent proteins were detected, and peptide fingerprinting combined with mass spectrometry of these proteins revealed them to include NuMA (nuclear protein that associates with the mitotic apparatus), heat shock proteins, and redox regulators. The abundance of NuMA in the leukemic blasts was significantly related to the presence of complex karyotype anomalies. Conditional expression of NuMA in a mouse myeloid cell line resulted in the induction of aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest in G(2)-M phases, and apoptosis. These results demonstrate the potential of proteome analysis with background-matched cell fractions obtained from fresh clinical specimens to provide insight into the mechanism of human leukemogenesis.","['Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical School, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we report elevated c-jun mRNA expression in AML patient bone marrow cells with t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16), and a high correlation in mRNA expression levels of AML1-ETO and c-jun within t(8;21)-positive AML patient cells. In myeloid U937 cells, c-jun mRNA and protein expression increase upon inducible expression of AML1-ETO. AML1-ETO transactivates the human c-jun promoter through the proximal activator protein (AP-1) site by activating the JNK pathway. Overexpression of JNK-inhibitor JIP-1 and chemical JNK inhibitors reduce the transactivation capacity of AML1-ETO on the c-jun promoter and the proapoptotic function of AML1-ETO in U937 cells. An autocrine mechanism involving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) might participate in AML1-ETO mediated JNK-signaling, because AML1-ETO induces G-CSF and G-CSF-R expression, and G-CSF-R-neutralizing antibodies reduce AML1-ETO-induced JNK phosphorylation. These data suggest a model in which AML1-ETO induces proto-oncogene c-jun expression via the proximal AP-1 site of the c-jun promoter in a JNK-dependent manner.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany.']",,,['CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The quantitative analysis reveals that mitochondrial aggregation is not inhibited by caspase-3 inhibitor ZEVD. Furthermore, bcl-x(L) transfection cannot suppress mitochondrial aggregation. However, overexpression of bcl-x(L) inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Therefore, mitochondrial aggregation is an event upstream of cytochrome c release during apoptosis. This mitochondrial aggregation was not observed in human leukemia H9 cells where apoptosis occurs in a mitochondria-independent fashion. Our studies imply that changes in the localization of mitochondria participate in the regulation of apoptosis through cytochrome c release.","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The c-fos SRE is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of ternary complex factor (TCF) but is also regulated by a RhoA-dependent pathway. The mechanism of this pathway is unclear. Since MKL1 (also known as MAL, BSAC, and MRTF-A) is broadly expressed, we assessed its role in serum induction of c-fos and other SRE-regulated genes with a dominant negative MKL1 mutant (DN-MKL1) and RNA interference (RNAi). We found that DN-MKL1 and RNAi specifically blocked SRE-dependent reporter gene activation by serum and RhoA. Complete inhibition by RNAi required the additional inhibition of the related factor MKL2 (MRTF-B), showing the redundancy of these factors. DN-MKL1 reduced the late stage of serum induction of endogenous c-fos expression, suggesting that the TCF- and RhoA-dependent pathways contribute to temporally distinct phases of c-fos expression. Furthermore, serum induction of two TCF-independent SRE target genes, SRF and vinculin, was nearly completely blocked by DN-MKL1. Finally, the RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein formed by the t(1;22) translocation of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia had a markedly increased ability to activate SRE reporter genes, suggesting that its activation of SRF target genes may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, 1212 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027, USA.']",,,"['R01 CA050329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 50329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 87064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Three clones of CEM cells were compared: C7-14, C1-15 and C1-6. C7-14 and C1-15 are subclones from the original clones C7 (sensitive to apoptosis by glucocorticoids) and C1 (resistant). C1-6 is a spontaneous revertant to sensitivity from the C1 clone. Previously we presented data on the sets of genes whose expression is altered in these cell clones after 20 h exposure to dexamethasone (Dex). The two sensitive clones, which respond by undergoing apoptosis starting about 24h after Dex is added, both showed >2.5-fold induction of 39 genes and 2-fold reduction of expressed levels from 21 genes. C1-15, the resistant clone, showed alterations in a separate set of genes. In this paper, we present further analysis of the data on genes regulated in these cell clones after 20 h Dex and compare them with the genes regulated after 12h Dex. Some, but not all the genes found altered at 20 h are altered at 12h, consistent with our hypothesis that sequential gene regulation eventually provokes full apoptosis. We also compare the levels of basal gene expression in the three clones. At the basal level no single gene stands out, but small sets of genes differ >2-fold in basal expression between the two sensitive and the resistant clone.

To study the effect of genetic background on HTLV-1 proviral load, we employed a mouse model of HTLV-1 infection that we had established. Here we analyzed nine strains of mice and found there is a great variation of proviral load among mouse strains that is not necessarily dependent on major histocompatibility complex. The antibody response is also different among these strains. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the importance of the genetic background other than major histocompatibility complex controlling the HTLV-1 proviral load.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Oncology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba Science City, Ibaraki, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial diagnosis of NK-cell malignancies can be difficult because of the lack of immunophenotypic clonality markers, morphologic heterogeneity, and a poor correlation between cytomorphology and prognosis. Therapeutic recommendations for NK-cell malignancies are derived from retrospective studies or case reports. Immature NK-cell malignancies often have aggressive behavior with poor prognosis, despite administration of acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia induction chemotherapy. The use of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue resulted in a prolonged survival in a small series of patients. NK-cell malignancies originating from cells with mature phenotypes form a spectrum of diseases with distinct prognosis. Patients with aggressive NK-cell leukemia invariably die within several months. Nasal and nasal-like NK/T-cell lymphomas with limited stage disease often respond to radiation therapy alone or combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with 5-year disease-free survival rates ranging from 30% to 75%. Patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia or chronic NK-cell lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes can have an indolent clinical course with long survival without therapy. However, approximately 66% of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia require low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate or cyclophosphamide or immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticosteroids or cyclosporine A for symptomatic cytopenias during the course of their disease.","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers (OSCC) case-control study of foetal exposure to diagnostic X-rays and from the cohort studies of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were used, together with associated dose estimates. Excess relative risk and excess absolute risk coefficients were compared, fully taking into consideration the various sources of uncertainty. RESULTS: The excess relative risk coefficient for childhood (< 15 years of age) cancer obtained from the OSCC was around 50 Gy(-1), leading to an excess absolute risk coefficient for incident cases of about 8% Gy(-1). However, the statistical, dosimetry, modelling and other uncertainties associated with these risk estimates are appreciable, and there is reason to believe that these coefficients could be systematic overestimates. When these uncertainties and those associated with the equivalent risk coefficients derived from the Japanese cohort exposed in utero are taken into account, the risk estimates for childhood cancer obtained from these two sources are compatible. These coefficients are consistent with the high relative risk of childhood leukaemia among the Japanese survivors exposed as children. The absence of cases of childhood solid tumours among the Japanese children irradiated after birth in contrast to the significant excesses found in both intrauterine exposure studies might be explained by the cells from which these cancers originate being predominantly sensitive only to exposure in utero. CONCLUSIONS: The consistency of the childhood cancer risk coefficients derived from the Oxford Survey and from the Japanese cohort irradiated in utero supports a causal explanation of the association between childhood cancer and an antenatal X-ray examination found in case-control studies. This implies that doses to the foetus in utero of the order of 10 mSv discernibly increase the risk of childhood cancer. However, uncertainties in risk estimates are such that it is difficult to conclude reliably from these epidemiological data what the level of risk at these low doses might be, beyond the inference that the risk is not zero or has been grossly underestimated.","['BNFL, Risley, Warrington WA3 6AS, UK. r.wakeford@bnfl.com']",,33,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a high probability that in the future, MS/MS or a similar technology will be applied to screening for many additional disorders, both metabolic and non-metabolic. The ability to examine DNA in the Guthrie specimen, currently used in second-tier screening, has opened up opportunities for primary screening of a huge array of potential disorders that previously could not be identified in the newborn. Among the possibilities under current discussion are type I diabetes, severe combined immunodeficiency, fragile X syndrome, hereditary hemochromatosis, and lymphoblastic leukemia. The major problems with these considerations, however, are that preventive treatment is not yet possible for most of these disorders, and for many, the abnormal finding determines only susceptibility for and not certainty of disease. Our experiences in the past with such newborn screening as that for histidinemia, which was found not to produce disease, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, which was not medically beneficial and had negative psychological effects, are lessons that must be taken seriously when considering new avenues of screening. Beyond further application to the Guthrie blood specimen and testing in a centralized laboratory is the broader concept of newborn screening exemplified by universal screening for hearing impairment. This screening is conducted directly on the newborn in the newborn nursery. This type of in-hospital universal screening may have wider application in the future. Much activity is underway to develop a consensus on appropriate newborn screening. This activity has been led by the Genetic Disease Branch of the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics and, currently, in collaboration with the American College of Medical Genetics through a committee to promulgate criteria for inclusion in newborn screening. The aphorism, ""good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment,"" may be applied to newborn screening. Our challenge now is to use the experience we have from the previous bad judgements to guarantee future good judgements.","[""Division of Genetics, Children's Hospital Boston, Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the LIF doses used improved the development of parthenogenetic mouse embryos at the preimplantation stages and increased the amount of blastocysts by 16%, on average, as compared to the control.

The data we obtained suggest that exogenous LIF can improve pre- and postimplantation development of parthenogenetic mouse embryos due, possibly, to increased survival rate of embryonic stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts. LIF improves not only the development of the parthenogenetic embryo per se, but also the formation of its extraembryonic envelopes, which leads to the development of a larger placenta in LIF-treated parthenogenetic embryos, as compared to the control.","['Institute of Genetics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, 1113 Bulgaria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase that converts uric acid (UA) into the soluble compound allantoin, has been shown to control hyperuricemia faster and more reliably than allopurinol.(1) METHODS: A compassionate use trial, running from January 1999 to December 2001, provided access to rasburicase for patients in nine countries who were at risk for TLS during the initiation of chemotherapy. Of the 280 patients enrolled in the study, 278 received rasburicase and were included in the analysis. A total of 166 pediatric patients who had leukemia (approximately 74%), lymphoma (approximately 24%), or solid tumors (approximately 3%) were treated with rasburicase. One hundred twelve adults with either leukemia (68%) or lymphoma (30%) also were treated. Rasburicase (0.20 mg/kg) was administered intravenously once a day for 1 to 7 days, at the investigator's discretion. Two doses daily could be administered during the first 3 days. A response was defined as a reduction in UA level or maintenance of a UA level less than 7.5 mg/dL (or less than 6.5 mg/dL, for children age < 13 years). RESULTS: UA levels at 24-48 hours after administration of the last dose of rasburicase were available for 122 pediatric patients and 97 adult patients. The mean UA level in 29 hyperuricemic children decreased from 15.1 mg/dL to 0.4 mg/dL, whereas in 27 hyperuricemic adults, the mean level decreased from 14.2 mg/dL to 0.5 mg/dL. Prophylactic administration of rasburicase to prevent TLS during chemotherapy reduced UA levels from a mean of 4.4 mg/dL to 0.8 mg/dL in 93 nonhyperuricemic children and from 4.8 mg/dL to 0.4 mg/dL in 70 nonhyperuricemic adults (for all reductions in UA levels, P < 0.001).

METHODS: In the current prospective randomized clinical trial at a university-affiliated tertiary cancer center, adult patients with cancer who had fever (> or = 38.3 degrees C or > or = 38.0 degrees C for > 2 hours) and neutropenia (< or = 500/mm(3) or < 1000/mm(3) but declining) requiring hospitalization were randomized to receive either cefepime or imipenem. Vancomycin or amikacin was added on suspicion of gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial infection, respectively. RESULTS: Patients who received an imipenem regimen or a cefepime regimen were comparable in terms of age, gender, underlying malignancy, prior transplantation, degree and trend of neutropenia, and presence of central venous catheters (P > or = 0.3). An intent-to-treat analysis showed a 68% response rate to the imipenem regimen, compared with a 75% response rate to the cefepime regimen (P = 0.2). The rates of antibiotic-related adverse events and superinfections also were comparable (P = 0.6). There was no difference in response among patients who received imipenem or cefepime alone compared with patients who also received vancomycin or amikacin (P = 1.0). Leukemia was the only independent risk factor associated with a poor outcome (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-10.7; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem and cefepime had similar efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of adult cancer patients with fever and neutropenia who required hospitalization.

The goals of the current study were to evaluate the efficacy of the triple combination regimen with IFN-alpha, ara-C, and HHT in newly diagnosed Ph-positive CML and to assess the impact of the added sequential therapy with imatinib on overall prognosis. METHODS: Ninety patients with Ph-positive CML in early chronic phase received the triple regimen. Therapy consisted of 5 million units (MU)/m(2) IFN-alpha subcutaneously (s.c. daily, ara-C 10 mg s.c. daily, and HHT 2.5 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily x 5 every month. After a median duration of 16.5 months of therapy, 78 patients had their therapy changed to 400 mg orally administered imatinib daily. RESULTS: With the triple regimen, 85 patients (94%) achieved complete hematologic response and 67 patients (74%) had a cytogenetic response (Ph suppression to < or = 90%) which was complete (Ph 0%) in 20 patients (22%) and major in 42 patients (46%). Myelosuppression was significant, resulting in considerable reductions in the dose schedules. After 12 months of therapy, the median IFN-alpha dose was 1.6 MU/m(2) daily, the median ara-C dose was 1.85 mg daily, and the median number of HHT days was 2 every month. Only three patients developed blastic phase while receiving the triple regimen. With the change to imatinib therapy, currently 57 patients (63%) are in complete cytogenetic response and 69 patients (76%) in major cytogenetic response. With a median follow-up time of 46 months for the total study group, the estimated 5-year survival rate was 88%, and only 8 patients (9%) to date have developed blastic phase. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of IFN-alpha, ara-C, and HHT followed by imatinib (imposed by the discovery of the latter drug) resulted in an estimated 5-year survival rate of 88%. This finding suggests that imatinib combination regimens may improve the prognosis in CML.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M. D.

Morphological and phenotypical analyses of the established AML-I cells demonstrated that they belong to a preadipocyte cell line as indicated by their storage of lipid droplets and expression of surface antigens similar to those found on bone marrow stromal cells (MSC). Through cell culture under adipogenic conditions, effective differentiation of AML-I cells into adipocytes was induced by an adipogenesis inducing cocktail (INC) made up of a mixture of methylisobutylxanthine, hydrocortisone, and indomethacin. By contrast, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma), which plays a key role in lipids metabolism and is highly expressed in AML-I cells, decreased the number of lipid droplets in AML-I cells. Here we report the establishment of a unique human derived-preadipocyte cell line, AML-I, and its bi-directional adipogenic response to different type stimulation, i.e., one is a refractory response to troglitazone, a well-known adipogenic stimulator, and a positive response to INC, an adipogenesis induction cocktail. These results suggest that, based on the adipogenic response, there might be some distinct lineages in human adipocytes and that the unique differentiation of AML-I cells should be useful for analyzing both the differentiation and regulation of human preadipocytes.","['Department of Pathology, 1st Unit, Shimane Medical University, Izumo, Japan. ikuko@shimane-med.ac.jp']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

GVL effects were induced with donor spleen cells from mice immunized across MHC or mHgs barriers with BCL/1 cells or normal BALB/c spleen cells. Our data suggest that spleen cells from donor mice immunized against murine B-cell leukemia of BALB/c origin, or to a lesser extent against normal host alloantigens, induce better therapeutic GVL effects with less great-versus-host disease (GVHD) across both mHgs and MHC. The cytokine profile of effector cells inducing predominantly GVL effects with reduced GVHD across MHC and mHg barriers consisted preferentially of upregulated IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 in donors, implying a Th-1 to Th-2 cytokine shift.

Characterization of leukemias by immunotyping is particularly helpful when the morphology is difficult to interpret. The major advantage of using immune markers by flow cytometry is the identification of particular leukemia subtype, not recognized by morphologic criteria, which may have prognostic significance. Current literature suggests when peripheral blood (PB) is consisted of 30% blasts or higher diagnosis of acute leukemia is most likely. However, bone marrow aspiration may also be performed as a confirmatory diagnosis. Immunotyping of PB and BM in leukemias not only determine the decision making for a specific therapeutic regimen, but also is a practical prognostic indicator. MATERIAL/METHODS: We evaluated 18 patients with acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) and 13 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). In all cases, the amount of blasts in PB was 30% or higher. Two ml PB and BM samples from each patient was collected. Following the preparation process, expression of markers was detected by using flow cytometry. The panel of monoclonal antibodies used in this study were consisted of CD3, CD7, CD5 (for T lymphocytes lineage); CD19, CD22, CD20, CD10 (for B lymphocytes lineage); CD13, CD14, CD33 (for myeloid subsets); and TDT, HLA-DR, CD45 (non lineage restricted). Expression levels of PB and BM markers were compared by using statistical analysis. RESULTS: The results showed apparent discrepancies for some markers in ALL group. However, in AML patients most of the selected markers have shown considerable correlation between PB and BM samples. Only four markers (CD13, CD14, CD45, and HLA-DR) showed positive correlation. In contrast, most markers (CD3, CD5, CD13, CD14, CD19, CD45, HLA-DR, and TdT) showed strong correlation between PB and BM samples in AML group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggests that targeted gating strategy for blast population as well as selection of a suitable panel of monoclonal antibodies may be essential for diagnosis of leukemia resulting in similar immunotyping pattern in PB and BM. Although our results are preliminary, this can minimize the necessity of BM aspiration for leukemia patients.","['Depertment of Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. rezaei@mui.ac.ir']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that a functional, soluble form of the HTLV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein, gp46, fused to an immunoglobulin Fc region (gp46-Fc) binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on mammalian cells. Substantial binding of gp46-Fc to HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells that express HSPGs was detected, whereas binding to the sister CHO lines 2244, which expresses no HSPGs, and 2241, which expresses no glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), was much reduced. Enzymatic removal of HSPGs from HeLa and CHO K1 cells also reduced gp46-Fc binding. Dextran sulfate inhibited gp46-Fc binding to HSPG-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas chondroitin sulfate was less effective. By contrast, dextran sulfate inhibited gp46-Fc binding to GAG-negative cells such as CHO 2244, CHO 2241, and Jurkat T cells weakly or not at all. Dextran sulfate inhibited HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-pseudotyped virus infection of permissive, HSPG-expressing target cells and blocked syncytium formation between HTLV-1 Env-expressing cells and HSPG-expressing permissive target cells. Finally, HSPG-expressing cells were more permissive for HTLV-1 Env-pseudotyped virus infection than HSPG-negative cells. Thus, similar to other pathogenic viruses, HTLV-1 may have evolved to use HSPGs as cellular attachment receptors to facilitate its propagation.","['Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee University, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomic instability is usually associated with disease progression, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia or a poor prognosis as observed in hallmark Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is unclear whether the phenotype of genomic instability is a primary consequence of Bcr/Abl expression or if it is secondarily acquired in the multistep process of tumor evolution. To address this issue, we measured the frequency of insertions and deletions in P190(BCR/ABL) transgenic mice. These mice ubiquitously express Bcr/Abl for an average of 3 months before developing B-cell type lymphoma/leukemia. Genome scanning for insertions and deletions in samples of DNA extracted from kidney and spleen tissues taken from preleukemic animals was performed using the inter-simple sequence repeat PCR. We observed an increased frequency of insertions and deletions in the tissues of preleukemic animals, which could be partially reversed with the c-Abl specific inhibitor STI571. These results suggest that the expression of Bcr/Abl can directly induce a mutator phenotype that antedates overt neoplastic transformation, and that STI571 appears to be capable of reversing this effect.","['Department of Medicine and the Division of Hematology and Molecular Oncology Group, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the R* state, GPCRs activate G-proteins. Agonist-independent R/R* isomerization is referred to as constitutive activity and results in an increase in basal G-protein activity, i.e. GDP/GTP exchange. Agonists stabilize the R* state and further increase, whereas inverse agonists stabilize the R state and decrease, basal G-protein activity. Constitutive activity is observed in numerous wild-type GPCRs and disease-causing GPCR mutants with increased constitutive activity. The human formyl peptide receptor (FPR) exists in several isoforms (FPR-26, FPR-98 and FPR-G6) and activates chemotaxis and cytotoxic cell functions of phagocytes through G(i)-proteins. Studies in HL-60 leukemia cell membranes demonstrated inhibitory effects of Na(+) and pertussis toxin on basal G(i)-protein activity, suggesting that the FPR is constitutively active. However, since HL-60 cells express several constitutively active chemoattractant receptors, analysis of constitutive FPR activity was difficult. Sf9 insect cells do not express chemoattractant receptors and G(i)-proteins and provide a sensitive reconstitution system for FPR/G(i)-protein coupling. Such expression studies showed that FPR-26 is much more constitutively active than FPR-98 and FPR-G6 as assessed by the relative inhibitory effects of Na(+) and of the inverse agonist cyclosporin H on basal G(i)-protein activity. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the E346A exchange in the C-terminus critically determines dimerization and constitutive activity of FPR. Moreover, N-glycosylation of the N-terminus seems to be important for constitutive FPR activity.

In this report, we studied the changes in Mcl-1 protein and mRNA expression induced by staurosporine and aspirin. Both drugs induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells and reduced the levels of Mcl-1 protein. The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 partially protected Mcl-1 from decay, indicating that both caspase-dependent and proteasome pathways are involved during apoptosis. Staurosporine also reduced Mcl-1 mRNA levels and this reduction was mostly caspase-dependent. In addition, staurosporine reduced the transcriptional activity of the Mcl-1 promoter fused to a luciferase gene reporter more than actinomycin D, a general inhibitor of transcription. Thus, we conclude that staurosporine down-regulates Mcl-1 mRNA levels by inhibiting transcription in a caspase-dependent manner and reduces Mcl-1 protein levels by a caspase-independent post-transcriptional mechanism. In contrast aspirin, at doses and times that induced loss of viability and decay of Mcl-1 protein, had no effect on Mcl-1 mRNA levels. Aspirin rapidly inhibited de novo protein synthesis before caspase activation. Moreover, the translational factor eIF2alpha was transiently phosphorylated and therefore inhibited very soon after aspirin treatment. Aspirin also inhibited the luciferase reporter activity of several attached promoter constructs, but it did not affect the luciferase activity of a construct containing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in its mRNA 5(')UTR. We conclude that staurosporine inhibits transcription and translation, whereas aspirin only inhibits cap-dependent translation. Treatment with cycloheximide, at doses that inhibit protein synthesis without affecting cell viability, also induced Mcl-1 protein decay. Mcl-1 disappearance might be necessary but not sufficient for the induction of apoptosis by staurosporine and aspirin. A model for the control of Mcl-1 during drug-induced apoptosis is presented.","[""Unitat de Bioquimica, Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, E-08907 L'Hospitalet, Spain.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 3 x 10(7) bone marrow cells mixed with 1 x 10(7) spleen cells from the same BALB/c mouse were transplanted into the nonablative irradiated inbred 615 mouse which received a single subcutaneous injection of 1 x 10(6) L615 leukemia cells three days before. The experiments were designed as follows (ten mice in each group): myeloablative BMT control group (group A), nonmyeloablative conditioning without BMT group (group B), nonmyeloablative BMT group (group C), and nonmyeloablative BMT + DLI group (group D). GVL effects were assessed by survival time, white blood cell count and L615 cells in peripheral blood and histologic changes. GVHD was assessed by signs of weight loss, ruffled fur, diarrhea and histologic changes of skin, liver and small intestines. Chimerism was detected by cytogenetic analysis and PCR technique. RESULTS: The survival time of group A, B, C and D was (20.3 +/- 13.4), (15.9 +/- 1.1), (21.6 +/- 1.7) and (37.8 +/- 2.0) days, respectively, being no significant difference between group A and group C (P > 0.05). The survival time of group C was longer than that of group B (P < 0.01). And among group B, C and D, group D had the longest survival time (P < 0.01). GVHD signs and histologic changes were observed in 60% of control group mice at + 14 day, but none of group C and group D. 40% of mice in group A died of treatment associated morbidity within two weeks, but none in group C and group D. Allogeneic chimerism was kept in group A, but excluded gradually in group C. CONCLUSION: GVL effect seems preserved in nonmyeloablative BMT mice, but weaker than that in myeloablative BMT mice. GVL effect seems to be enhanced by DLI after nonmyeloablative BMT.

METHODS: AML cells were cultured in either presence or absence of cytokine cocktails. DC were studied for morphology, and cytochemical and immunofluorescent staining. Functions of DC were examined by MLC, FITC-conjugated dextran uptake test, and LDH release assay. RT-PCR and FISH were used to analyze the specific fusion genes of culture-derived DC. RESULTS: Classical DC morphological changes occurred in all 15 cultured AML cells. DC-associated surface molecules such as CD(1a), CD(80), CD(86), CD(106), CD(83) and HLA-DR were upregulated (P < 0.05). The allostimulatory abilities of culture-derived DC were significantly higher than those of AML cells uncultured or cultured in the absence of cytokines (P < 0.05). Culture-derived DC only in the presence of GM-CSF + IL-4 have phagocytotic activities. CTL assay was performed in 5 of the 15 samples. At effector/target ratio of 20:1, auto-T lymphocytes primed with the culture-derived DC exhibited no more killing activity to auto-AML cells than those stimulated by IL-2 or uncultured AML cells. Culture-derived DC presenced the native AML-specific aberrant karyotype and related fusion gene. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine cocktails could in vitro induce AML cells into DC with classical morphology, immunophenotype and function. DC maturity induced by different cytokine cocktails could be variable. Culture-derived DC were originated from the native AML cells.

The b2a2 transcript patients in blastic crisis were 52.6% (10/19) for lymphoblastic and 33.3% (30/90) for myeloblastic (P > 0.05). The platelet count of untreated patients with b3a2 isoform [(485.9 +/- 333.8) x 10(9)/L, n = 125] was distinctly higher than those with b2a2 isoform [(380.5 +/- 321.9) x 10(9)/L, n = 62] (P < 0.05). 66.0% (31/47) and 64.4% (29/45) of the patients in CP and AP/BP respectively co-expressed M- and m-bcr/abl transcripts (P > 0.05). One patient expressed only m-bcr/abl transcript was of typical acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Both two micro -bcr/abl(+) patients were of typical CML. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all typical CML patients express M-bcr/abl transcripts, most of them coexpress M-bcr/abl and m-bcr/abl transcripts, a few possesses only micro -bcr/abl fusion gene. m-bcr/abl(+) are usually associated with AML or CML in myeloblastic crisis besides acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with b3a2 isoform are prone to higher platelet count before treatment.","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intensity of centromere fluorescence, shown by indirect immunofluorescence staining, decreased with HT treatment. Western blot showed that the anti-centromere antibody (ACA) serum used in this study recognized 8 proteins with different molecular weights: 140, 80, 70, 56, 37, 34, 32 and 17 kD. The amounts of some of these proteins were reduced to different extents by HT treatment. The ACA antibodies that recognized the 17, 80 and 140 kD proteins in L1210 cells also cross-reacted with 3 proteins with similar molecular weights which are known to be CenpA, CenpB and CenpC, respectively. Northern and Dot blot analyses revealed that the level of CenpB mRNA in HT-treated cells was markedly lower than that in the untreated cells. These results suggest that HT may cause a decrease in the intracellular level of some centromere proteins, probably by inhibiting mRNA expression of corresponding genes. Moreover, it is possible that the cell-killing and appotosis-inducing effects of HT may be mediated by the inhibition of the expression of CenpB and other centromere protein genes.","['College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here a study based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of the translocation breakpoints in seven patients and detailed molecular studies using Southern blotting on two of these patients. The FISH studies have shown a cluster of breakpoints within a cosmid contig proximal to the HLXB9 gene.

To determine whether recurrent genomic imbalances are a feature of HL, CD30-positive HRS cells were laser-microdissected from 20 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs) and four HL-derived cells lines and subjected to analyses by comparative genomic hybridization. In primary tumors, the most frequently involved chromosomal gains were 17q (70%), 2p (40%), 12q (40%), 17p (40%), 22q (35%), 9p (30%), 14q (30%), and 16p (30%), with minimal overlapping regions at 17q21, 2p23-13, 12q24, 17p13, 22q13, 9p24-23, 14q32, 16p13.3, and 16p11.2.

Statistical analysis revealed significantly more gains of 2p and 14q in the older adult cases; loss of 13q was associated with a poor outcome. The results suggest that there is a set of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities associated with cHL and provide further evidence that cHL is genetically distinct from nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Abnormalities of 17q are infrequent in other lymphomas or NLPHL; this finding, coupled with current knowledge of gene expression in cHL, suggests that genes present on 17q may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cHL.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Virus Centre, Institute of Comparative Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom. dtychui@aol.com']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, effects of As(2)O(3) in normal peripheral blood T cells have not been studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether As(2)O(3) would induce apoptosis in normal T cells and therefore may have immunosuppressive side effects. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay, caspase activation by flow cytometry and colorimetric assay, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) by flow cytometry. The release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria was measured by confocal microscopy, and the expression of molecules regulating apoptosis was measured by Western blotting. As(2)O(3), at clinically achievable therapeutic concentrations, induces apoptosis in peripheral blood T cells. As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis was associated with reduced deltapsi(m), enhanced generation of intracellular ROS, decreased levels of intracellular GSH, release of cytochrome c and AIF from the mitochondria, activation of caspases, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), and up-regulation of Bax expression. In addition, exogenous GSH protected lymphocytes from As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis and blocked depolarization of deltapsi(m), generation of ROS, and release of both cytochrome c and AIF. These data indicate that As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis in T cells by enhancing oxidative stress and that Bcl-2 appears to play a major role in As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis.","['Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA. sgupta@uci.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacological basis of this interaction has been elucidated by crystallographic studies. Imatinib mesylate binds to the amino acids of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase ATP binding site and stabilizes the inactive, non-ATP-binding form of BCR-ABL, thereby preventing tyrosine autophosphorylation, and in turn, phosphorylation of its substrates. This process ultimately results in a ""switch-off"" of the downstream signaling pathways that promote leukemogenesis. Despite high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses to imatinib therapy, the emergence of resistance to imatinib has been recognized as a major problem in the treatment of Ph-positive leukemia. Considerable progress has been made in developing therapeutic agents that are effective against molecular targets specifically expressed in CML cells. It is important to emphasize that BCR-ABL is the ideal target for therapy even at relapse; at least one general mechanism of resistance involves maintenance of an active BCR-ABL kinase inside leukemic cells. It is also notable that the high frequency of BCR-ABL mutations and amplifications represents the high degree of heterogeneity in patients with advanced CML, in whom multiple leukemic clones may exist. For these reasons, a single inhibitor is unlikely to be able to block all mutants described so far.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan.']",,12,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mortality and illness absence data were extracted from the Shell Oil Company's health surveillance system (HSS). The standardised mortality ratio was used as a measure of mortality risk. Morbidity frequency and duration of absence were calculated by age, sex, and four health risk factors (cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolaemia, and obesity). RESULTS: Male employees experienced a significant deficit in mortality for all causes of death, all cancers, lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease compared with the corresponding US population. Brain cancer was non-significantly increased, with six observed and five expected deaths; mortality from leukaemia was consistently lower than expected. The majority of employees had no illness absences of six days or longer during the 10 year study period. The loss of productivity (in terms of days of absence) was greater for employees with health risk factors. Ever smoking male employees had a 79% increase of heart disease and more than 50% higher rates of respiratory disease and musculoskeletal disorders compared to non-smokers. Smokers were absent 2.9 and 1.6 more days than non-smokers and ex-smokers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the comparison population, significantly fewer deaths were seen for all causes combined, all cancers, lung cancer, heart disease, or non-malignant respiratory disease.

Tax is also able to induce cellular transformation of T lymphocytes probably by modulating transcriptional activity of cellular factors, including nuclear factor-kappaB, E2F, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and p53. Recently, we characterized in HTLV-I-infected cells the presence of a novel viral protein, HBZ, encoded by the complementary strand of the HTLV-I RNA genome (Gaudray, G., Gachon, F., Basbous, J., Biard-Piechaczyk, M., Devaux, C., and Mesnard, J.-M. (2002) J. Virol. 76, 12813-12822). HBZ is a nuclear basic leucine zipper protein that down-regulates Tax-dependent viral transcription by inhibiting the binding of cAMP-response element-binding protein-2 to the HTLV-I promoter. In searching for other cellular targets of HBZ, we identified two members of the Jun family, JunB and c-Jun. Co-immunoprecipitation and cellular colocalization confirmed that HBZ interacts in vivo with JunB and c-Jun. When transiently introduced into CEM cells with a reporter gene containing the AP-1 site from the collagenase promoter, HBZ suppressed transactivation by c-Jun. On the other hand, the combination of HBZ with Jun-B had higher transcriptional activity than JunB alone. Consistent with the structure of its basic domain, we demonstrate that HBZ decreases the DNA-binding activity of c-Jun and JunB. Last, we show that c-Jun is no longer capable of activating the basal expression of the HTLV-I promoter in the presence of HBZ in vivo. Our results support the hypothesis that HBZ could be a negative modulator of the Tax effect by controlling Tax expression at the transcriptional level and by attenuating activation of AP-1 by Tax.","['Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CNRS/Universite Montpellier I, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5121/Institut Federatif de Recherche 122, Institut de Biologie, 4 Boulevard Henri IV, 34960 Montpellier Cedex 2, France.']",,,,,20030822,,,,,,,,

Recently it was formally demonstrated that such malignancies do, in fact, develop from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), according to immunophenotypic and functional criteria. The clinico-biological features of this neoplasm were moreover recently summarized from a large series of 23 patients. INFORMATION SOURCES: The main symptoms at presentation were cutaneous lesions and bone marrow failure, due to invasion by blastic cells, all of which were EBV negative and agranular. Most patients were initially sensitive to chemotherapy regimens, but they rapidly relapsed and died within 3 years. Only 2 allotransplanted patients were long survivors. Recurrent chromosomal aberrations involving chromosomes 5q, 6q, 12p, 13q, 15q and 9 were described and it was characteristic that these were associated in the same cell. In the present review we compared these findings to those in the literature. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: The concordant characteristics led us to confirm that this neoplasm actually represents a new entity, that we propose to rename early pDC leukemia/lymphoma. The diagnosis is primarily based on a characteristic immunophenotypic profile i.e. CD4+ CD56+ CD3- CD13- CD33- CD19-. Complementary analyses assessing the expression of more specific pDC-related markers showed the cells to be HLA-DR+, CD123high, CD116low, CD45RA+, BDCA-2+ or BDCA-4+. Such complementary investigations are necessary only in the case of an atypical phenotype, in order to confirm a pDC origin and exclude another hematologic disease. This presently regards the expression of CD33 or cytoplasmic CD3e (cyCD3e) and the negativity of CD56.","['EFS Rhone-Alpes, Dept. of Cellular Immunology, Grenoble, France. marie-christine.jacob@efs.sante.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD10 is not normally expressed on the surface of B-CLL cells. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether B-CLL cells, induced into apoptosis, expressed surface CD10, since a correlation between apoptosis and CD10 expression has been demonstrated. DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood cells from 31 untreated B-CLL patients were induced into apoptosis by etoposide, fludarabine or Ga(mu)-Ab treatment and tested for CD10 expression by flow cytometry. Normal CD5+ B cells were also induced into apoptosis and tested for CD10 expression. RESULTS: CD10 positive cells were absent in B-CLL cell suspensions, but were detected following in vitro culture, and their appearance paralleled that of apoptotic cells. Treatment with etoposide, fludarabine or Ga(mu)-Ab enhanced both apoptosis and CD10 expression. Inhibition of apoptosis by VAD-fmk or Ga(delta)-Ab prevented CD10 expression. Cell separation tests following induction of apoptosis demonstrated that CD10+ cells were apoptotic. CD10+ cells were observed in the peripheral blood of two patients within a few hours following fludarabine infusion. In another patient, who failed to respond, no CD10+ cells were seen. Expression of CD10 was observed also in normal CD5+ B cells when these were induced into apoptosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that B-CLL cells, as well as normal CD5+ B cells, become CD10+ following apoptosis induction in vitro. Some of the data obtained also suggest a use for CD10 to monitor apoptosis of B-CLL in a clinical setting.","['Dipartimento di Ematologia Azienda, Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino, Reggio Calabria, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emergence of resistance to IM warrants the exploration of novel well-tolerated anticancer agents. We intended to evaluate the effect of PS-341 on proliferation, survival, and cellular events in Bcr/Abl-positive cells sensitive and resistant to IM, and to investigate the effect of PS-341 and IM in conjunction. DESIGN AND METHODS: Bcr/Abl-positive cell lines sensitive (p210Bcr/Abl KBM5, p210Bcr/Abl KBM7, and p190Bcr/Abl Z-119) or resistant (KBM5-R) to IM were treated with PS-341 alone or in combination with IM. The effect on cell growth was determined using the MTT assay. Cell-cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was evaluated by measurement of sub-G1 DNA content, annexin V binding, and caspase 3 activity assays. Levels of apoptotic proteins, P-IkBalpha, Bcr/Abl, and phosphorylated Bcr/Abl were determined by western blotting. NF-kappaB activity was evaluated by electromobility gel shift assays. RESULTS: PS-341 exerted growth inhibition effects in IM-sensitive and -resistant cells. This phenomenon correlated with accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of cell cycle; transient downregulation of NFkappaB DNA binding activity; downregulation of Bcl-xL; activation of caspase 3, induction of apoptosis; inhibition of expression and phosphorylation of Bcr/Abl. Sequential combination of PS-341 followed by IM demonstrated a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect in IM-sensitive cells; concomitant exposure was antagonistic. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: PS-341 suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in Bcr/Abl-positive cells sensitive and resistant to IM. The use of PS-341 should be explored in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to IM. Trials of combinations of PS-341 and IM require cautious design.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-operative group and single-institution studies which include large numbers of patients with relatively long follow-up demonstrate that, with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the majority of newly-diagnosed patients appear cured of their disease. The 5-year disease-free survival rates range from 75 to 85%. Early death is still observed in approximately 10% of patients and remains a difficult obstacle to increasing the cure rate. Prognostic factors which identify patients at high risk for recurrence are becoming increasingly recognized. Older age (over age 55-60 years), elevated white blood cell count at presentation (higher than 5,000-10,000/microl), and expression of CD56 unfavourably influence outcome. The treatment of such patients remains a challenge, although it is important to note that APL is the only type of AML in which a significant proportion of older patients may be cured. Because more patients are cured of their disease, potential long-term consequences may become increasingly recognized.

Encouraging results have been reported recently using less-intensive chemotherapy with anthracyclines alone, leading to a significant reduction in treatment-related toxicity during the consolidation phase and a high degree of compliance. Some ongoing risk-adapted protocols are now exploring the potential synergistic effect of ATRA and chemotherapy given simultaneously in consolidation. Preliminary data suggest that higher molecular remission rates post-consolidation and improved outcome may be obtained through this strategy. Persistence or recurrence of molecular disease at the end of consolidation is strongly associated with impending relapse and poor prognosis, indicating the need for further aggressive therapy. As for maintenance therapy, once demonstrated, the advantage of using ATRA with or without low-dose methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine has encouraged most groups to incorporate such treatment into their protocols for APL.","['Haematology Service, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain. msanz@uv.es']",,57,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 98% of cases of APL are associated with t(15;17) chromosomal translocation and fusion of the PML gene to that encoding RARalpha to yield an abnormal receptor with the capability of de-regulating gene expression in the haematopoietic cell, causing differentiation block and eventually the development of leukaemia. Since this original discovery, four other translocations were described in APL. In each of these the RARalpha gene is fused to different partner genes, all yielding aberrant nuclear receptors. These fusion proteins share in common the ability to repress rather than activate retinoic acid targets, one so strongly that the result is an ATRA-resistant form of the disease. In addition each of the partner proteins is important for normal cell growth and development. In this chapter we explore the biology of the RARalpha, the fusion proteins created in APL and the normal forms of the partner proteins. Through continued study of this disease it is hoped that novel treatments, potentially more applicable to other forms of leukaemia, may arise.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Box 1130, One Gustave L.

In other words, FAB M3 is interchangeable with a unique marker profile. More precisely, we have finally recognized a surrogate marker profile for leukaemia derived from the (15;17) translocation and expressing PML/RARalpha transcripts. To present this as a new development may come as a surprise to many. After all, the antigen expression pattern of AML-M3 was well recognized for many years: absence or weak expression of HLA-DR, CD117, CD15, CD11b and CD34 in the context of a myeloid phenotype (CD33 and CD13 expression) and frequently associated with moderate to high side-scatter appearance upon flow cytometric evaluation, depending upon the degree of granularity of the leukaemic cells. While partially correct, this established APL phenotype is both flawed and limited in its ability to distinguish APL from other AML subtypes, such as natural-killer-cell AML. Given the availability of phenotype-specific therapy for APL, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, failing to diagnose APL or misdiagnosing a case of AML with an APL-like phenotype will result in serious clinical consequences. Faced with this dilemma, we have recently performed a comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis of APL patients entered on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trials. Our results give diagnostic power to only three antigens, HLA-DR, CD11a and CD18, all of which are characteristically expressed at low levels by APL cells.

However, descriptive epidemiological reports on AML consider the disease as a single entity. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is an example of a truly unique AML subtype that has an easy-to-recognize morphology associated uniformly with distinct chromosomal and gene rearrangement aberration. Thus, APL is amenable to epidemiological studies as a model of human AML with a specific and well-characterized chromosomal and molecular abnormality. This chapter shows that epidemiological characteristics of APL are different from those of non-APL AML using data from the Los Angeles tumour registry and other sources. The principal distinct APL epidemiological features that so far have been described are the constant incidence with age after age 20, equal incidence in males and females and higher frequency among patients originating in Latin America. The APL-specific PML/RARalpha gene rearrangement is different in Latinos and non-Latinos. Therapy-related APL has the same response to treatment and outcome as de novo APL. It is therefore likely that aetiological factors for APL are different from those of other AML subtypes. So far no environmental and/or occupational risk factors have been found for APL. Future molecular studies of the APL-specific fusion gene combined with epidemiological and environmental investigations might lead to better understanding of specific aetiological factors in APL patients.","['Division of Haematology, Norris Cancer Centre, University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, 1441 Eastlake Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. douer_d@norris.hsc.usc.edu']",,56,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoma and leukemic cell lines failed to migrate towards laminin-4, -9, -11, moved poorly in response to laminin-1, -2/4, -5 and the renal laminin complex, but markedly locomoted towards the subendothelial laminin-8 and -10. The motility-promoting interaction with these latter laminins was interchangeably mediated by the alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins. Lymphocyte locomotion on laminins assayed in the presence of cytokines was either reduced or enhanced suggesting that local cytokine milieu could further influence motility response.","['Divisione di Oncologia Sperimentale 2, CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, CRO-IRCCS, Aviano, Aviano 3081, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective, open-label, parallel pharmacokinetic study in which 29 subjects were given 90 mg/m (2) i.v. liposomal (L)-ATRA (16 subjects) every other day or 45 mg/m (2) oral ATRA (13 subjects) daily over 15 days. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed on days 1, 9, and 15. RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects (11 in each group) completed the study and were evaluated. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0, infinity)] and maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) of ATRA did not decrease during the 15 days of L-ATRA treatment. However, the oral ATRA regimen resulted in a significant decrease in the AUC(0, infinity) and C(max) of 45.3% and 31.8%, respectively, on day 9 as compared with that to day 1 (p< 0.05). In addition, the mean AUC(0, infinity) was 13- and 22-fold greater for L-ATRA than for oral ATRA on days 1 and 9, respectively. Despite the significantly higher plasma concentrations after L-ATRA treatment, the side effects of each formulation were similar, except for dermal exfoliation, which was seen in 31% of the subjects after L-ATRA dosing, and abnormal liver function tests that were seen in 23% of the subjects after oral ATRA administration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that i.v. administration of L-ATRA maintains higher and stable plasma ATRA concentrations than oral ATRA in healthy subjects after repetitive administration. L-ATRA with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile may have potential advantages over oral ATRA and may be more efficacious in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia or other retinoid-responsive cancers.","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, Section of Immunobiology and Drug Carriers, The University of Texas M.

A new canarypox-based recombinant vaccine is the canarypox-feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) vaccine (EURIFEL FeLV; Merial) that expresses the FeLV env and gag protective genes. This paper describes experiments which demonstrate that it is effective against any oronasal FeLV challenge. The protection was shown to be solid against an oronasal challenge one year after the initial vaccination, and was effective against a very severe 'in-contact' challenge.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial was carried out in 33 patients with acute leukemia at different stages of chemotherapy, 20 patients subjected to transplantation of autologic hemopoietic cells and 21 patients who had received transplantation of allogenic hemopoietic cells. To study the dynamics of the CMV infection markers, enzyme immunoassay of the titer of the specific immunoglobulins M and G was made, detection of the viral antigen in immunofluorescence reaction and cultivation with fibroblast cell culture and determination of the cytomegalovirus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Before chemotherapy, up to 90% patients with acute leukemia were infected with cytomegalovirus (similar rate of infection was observed in healthy donors of hemopoietic cells). By the time of transplantation all the patients were infected with cytomegalovirus. During chemotherapy of acute leukemia, the primary infection and reactivation of latent infection occurred in 30% patients, whereas CMV disease developed in 18% patients. In case of transplantation of autologic hemopoietic cells the rate of reactivation of CMV infection (15%) was one-half of that value in patients with acute leukemia (30%). Similar trend was observed in case of development of CMV disease (5% and 18%, respectively). In case of transplantation of allogenic hemopoietic cells the incidence of reactivation of CMV infection was three times higher than in case of transplantation of autologic hemopoietic cells (47.6% and 15%, respectively, p = 0.02). The incidence of development of CMV disease in case of transplantation of allogenic hemopoietic cells was also significantly higher than in case of transplantation of autologic hemopoietic cells (28.6% and 5%, respectively, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cytomegalovirus is an infection agent responsible for severe complications of chemotherapy of acute leukemia and transplantation of hemopoietic cells in patients with hemoblastoses. Among hematological patients, the group of the highest risk of development of this complication includes recipients of transplantation of allogenic hemopoietic cells, particularly from seronegative donors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 206 BCCLL patients (mean age 55.5 years, male/female = 1.66) entered the study conducted by Hematological Research Center in 1992-2000. RESULTS: Nine patients under 35 years of age did not survive 5 years except one female who achieved a complete remission on fludarabin. The type of bone marrow infiltration (diffuse vs interstitial and nodular), the time of lymphocyte count doubling (under or over 12 months) discriminate the patients by prognosis in the group of intermediate risk: medians of overall survival 65 months vs 148 months and 72 vs 133 months, respectively (p < 0.005 for both curves, log-rank criterion). Survival medians in groups with low (< 50% cells) and high (> 50% cells) expression of CD38+ cells in the group of intermediate BCCLL risk comprise 55 and 106 months (p = 0.005). The type of bone marrow infiltration and time of doubling of lymphocyte count overlap: > 70% patients with a diffuse type of bone marrow infiltration have the time of doubling under 12 months and vice versa while expression of CD38 do not overlap with these values. Combination of two signs (type of bone marrow infiltration and CD38 expression or time og lymphocyte count doubling and CD38 expression) allows more precise identification of prognostically unfavourable groups. Medians of survival for combination of the first two signs (two positive against two negative) comprise 51 months vs 169 months (p < 0.0001), for combination of the latter two signs 55 months vs 106 months was not reached (p < 0.001). Although most patients with a tumor form of BCCLL are referred to stage II, the prognosis in this form is much worse than in stage II, survival medians are 44 and 69 months, respectively (p < 0.05). A mutation status of the genes of a variable region of immunoglobulins enable identification of the group of patients with a relatively benign course of BCCLL (survival medians 61 and 289 months, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In patients under 35 years of age BCCLL runs unfavourably and seems to require intensive polychemotherapy. Usage of a combination of the signs (CD38, time of doubling of lymphocyte count and type of bone marrow infiltration) is a simple and reliable method of identification of prognostically different categories of patients in the group of an intermediate BCCLL risk. Prognosis in patients with a tumor form of BCCLL is unfavourable: medians of survival in patients with a tumor form and stage III-IV are comparable. Mutational status of the genes of immunoglobulin variable region may serve a marker of a long-term prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 11 patients received TBM in low-intensity regimen in Hematological Research Center in 1999-2001. All the patients were from a high risk group. Conditioning was based on the combination of fludarabin with busulfan. The transplanted precursor cells were taken from the bone marrow and/or peripheral donor blood. The retention was controlled by differential agglutination of erythrocytes and amplification of hypervariable sites of DNA. Minimal residual disease was controlled by standard cytogenetical tests, fluorescent in situ hybridization or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All the patients tolerated pretransplantation conditioning well. By chimerism, signs of retention of donor bone marrow on day +30 after TBM were observed in 9 patients of 11. Acute graft versus host reaction developed in 5 patients. This reaction was treated conventionally with methylprednisone and cyclosporin A, in 4 cases with a good effect. A complete remission persists in 5 patients. Mean follow-up lasted for 241 days. CONCLUSION: Thus, transplantation was successful in 50% patients with an unfavourable prognosis who are still in a complete remission.

The panel of monoclonal antibodies to T- and B-cell, myeloid antigens was used. The residual cells were estimated in 20 patients in remission. RESULTS: 78% cases were diagnosed to have an anomalous immunophenotype including coexpression of lymphoid and myeloid antigens, asynchronous expression of myeloid antigens. In the first remission the residual cells were detected in 20 patients due to aberrant antigen expression. The presence of MRD was stated if bone marrow contained more than 0.12% leukemic cells. The duration of the first remission and MRD correlated. 8 patients with MRD had remission for 3 to 6 months (median 4.7 months). 12 patients free of MRD were in remission for more than 6 months (for 8 to 26 months, median 19.7 months). The threshold level of the residual cells (0.12%) was confirmed statistically using the three-parameter probability model. CONCLUSION: This study confirms feasibility of using flow cytometry for detection of residual cells. MRD and duration of the first remission correlate.

Regarding hematopoiesis, it is believed that it can be influenced by connexin expression, but the exact role of GJ in cell death and proliferation is not clear. Using flow cytometry, we monitored the division rate of leukemic cell lines, communicating and not communicating with stromal cell line through GJ. We found that GJ-coupled cells (i) did not proliferate; (ii) were kept in G0; and (iii) were protected from drug-induced apoptosis when compared to either total or uncoupled cell population. We conclude that GJ coupling between stroma and leukemic lymphoblasts prevents proliferation, keeping cells in a quiescent state, thus increasing their resistance to antimitotic drugs. Since GJ are particularly abundant in the sub-endosteal environment, which harbors blood stem cells, we also asked which cells within the normal human BM communicate with the stroma. Using a primary BM stroma cell culture, our results show that 80% of CD34+ progenitors communicate through GJ. We propose that blood cell progenitors might be retained in the low-cycling state by GJ-mediated communication with the hematopoietic stroma.","['Centro de Transplante de Medula Ossea, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this data researchers are tackling problems ranging from the identification of 'cancer genes' to the formidable task of adding functional annotations to our rapidly growing gene databases. Specific research questions suggest patterns of gene expression that are interesting and informative: for instance, genes with large variance or groups of genes that are highly correlated. Cluster analysis and related techniques are proving to be very useful. However, such exploratory methods alone do not provide the opportunity to engage in statistical inference. Given the high dimensionality (thousands of genes) and small sample sizes (often <30) encountered in these datasets, an honest assessment of sampling variability is crucial and can prevent the over-interpretation of spurious results. We describe a statistical framework that encompasses many of the analytical goals in gene expression analysis; our framework is completely compatible with many of the current approaches and, in fact, can increase their utility. We propose the use of a deterministic rule, applied to the parameters of the gene expression distribution, to select a target subset of genes that are of biological interest. In addition to subset membership, the target subset can include information about relationships between genes, such as clustering. This target subset presents an interesting parameter that we can estimate by applying the rule to the sample statistics of microarray data. The parametric bootstrap, based on a multivariate normal model, is used to estimate the distribution of these estimated subsets and relevant summary measures of this sampling distribution are proposed. We focus on rules that operate on the mean and covariance. Using Bernstein's Inequality, we obtain consistency of the subset estimates, under the assumption that the sample size converges faster to infinity than the logarithm of the number of genes. We also provide a conservative sample size formula guaranteeing that the sample mean and sample covariance matrix are uniformly within a distance epsilon > 0 of the population mean and covariance. The practical performance of the method using a cluster-based subset rule is illustrated with a simulation study. The method is illustrated with an analysis of a publicly available leukemia data set.","['Division of Biostatistics, University of California, Earl Warren Hall 7360, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of the recipient's serologic status is paramount. However, the importance of the donor's serologic status in CMV-seropositive recipients is controversial. We analyzed the influence of the donor's CMV status in a large cohort of patients. A total of 7018 patients seropositive for CMV reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) were included; 5910 patients had undergone HLA-identical sibling SCT and 1108 patients had undergone unrelated donor SCT. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models were constructed for survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse incidence. Patients receiving grafts from CMV-seropositive HLA-identical sibling donors had the same survival as patients grafted from seronegative donors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; P =.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.14). However, unrelated donor stem cell (SC) transplant recipients receiving grafts from CMV-seropositive donors had an improved 5-year survival (35% versus 27%; HR = 0.8; P =.006), an improved event-free survival (30% versus 22%; HR = 0.8; P =.01), and a reduced transplant-related mortality (49% versus 62%; HR = 0.7; P <.001). There was no influence on the relapse incidence. The effects of donor CMV status remained in multivariate analyses. The effect of donor status was different among different disease categories. In patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), T-cell depletion abrogated the beneficial effect of donor status, suggesting that the effect is mediated through transfer of donor immunity. Our data suggest that donor CMV status influences outcome of unrelated SCT. For a CMV-seropositive patient, a seropositive donor might be preferable.","['Department of Hematology, Huddinge University Hospital, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.

ICSBP-/- mice develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like syndrome. Several observations on patients and mouse models have implicated ICSBP in the pathogenesis of CML. In this paper, we investigated whether ICSBP modulates the growth-promoting activity of Bcr/Abl, the causal oncoprotein for CML. When transformed with p210 Bcr/Abl, ICSBP-/- myeloid progenitor cells lost growth factor dependence and grew in the absence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. When ICSBP was ectopically expressed, Bcr/Abl-transformed cells underwent complete growth arrest and differentiated into mature, functional macrophages without inhibiting the kinase activity of Bcr/Abl. Providing a mechanistic basis for the growth arrest, ICSBP markedly repressed c-Myc messenger RNA (mRNA)-expression, a downstream target of Bcr/Abl. A further analysis with the ICSBP/estrogen receptor chimera showed that ICSBP repression of c-Myc is indirect and is mediated by another gene(s). We identified Blimp-1 and METS/PE1, potent c-Myc repressors, as direct targets of ICSBP activated in these cells. Consistent with this, ectopic Blimp-1 repressed c-Myc expression and inhibited cell growth. These results indicate that ICSBP inhibits growth of Bcr/Abl-transformed myeloid progenitor cells by activating several genes that interfere with the c-Myc pathway.","['Bldg 6, Rm 2A01, Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, 6 Center Dr MSC 2753, Bethesda, MD 20892-2753, USA.']",,,,,20030821,,,,,,,,

While responses in chronic-phase CML are generally durable, resistance develops in many patients with advanced disease. We evaluated novel antileukemic agents for their potential to overcome resistance in various imatinib-resistant cell lines. Using cell proliferation assays, we investigated whether different mechanisms of resistance to imatinib would alter the efficacy of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine) alone and in combination with imatinib. Our results indicate that resistance to imatinib induced by Bcr-Abl overexpression or by engineered expression of clinically relevant Bcr-Abl mutants does not induce cross-resistance to As2O3 or decitabine. Combined treatment with these agents and imatinib is beneficial in cell lines that have residual sensitivity to imatinib monotherapy, with synergistic growth inhibition achieved only at doses of imatinib that overcome resistance. In some imatinib-resistant cell lines, combination treatments that use low doses of imatinib lead to antagonism. Apoptosis studies suggest that this can be explained in part by the reduced proapoptotic activity of imatinib in resistant cell lines. These data underline the importance of resistance testing and provide a rational approach for dose-adjusted administration of imatinib when combined with other agents.","['Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",,,,,20030821,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed the presence of mRNA for both the MCR and the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel, a member of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (ASSC) superfamily, in human CD41(+) megacaryoblastic cells derived from cultured bone marrow CD34(+) isolates, as well as in the human erythromegakaryoblastic leukemia (HEL) cell line. Immunofluorescence also revealed the presence of both the MCR and ASSC in circulating CD34(+) and medullar CD41(+) megacaryoblastic cells, the former as a nucleocytoplasmic protein and the latter as a membrane-bound protein, as expected from earlier studies using MCR-specific targets. In a selective medium, the formation of erythrocyte burst-forming units, and of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, by circulating CD34(+) cells was influenced by the agonists deoxycorticosterone and aldosterone, as well as by the antagonists RU 26752 and ZK 91587, targeted for the MCR. The multiplication of the leukemic HEL progeny, derived from CD41(+) cells, was similarly altered by these steroids targeted for the MCR. In contrast, in the optimal growth medium, the multiplication, and colony formation by bone marrow CD34(+) progenitor cells were not altered by either aldosterone or ZK 91587. These and other studies reveal that the receptor-mediated action of mineralocorticoids may influence the functional maturation of the hematopoietic progenitor lineage, contrary to the classical notion where the mineralotropic effect would be a unique feature of the epithelial cell.","['INSERM and CNRS, Paris, France. massoud.mirshahi@bhdc.jussieu.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Significant increase in leukemia risk was observed in chemical manufacturing industry workers (OR=3.1, 95% CI=1.0-9.8). Increased risks for leukemia were observed from self-reported exposures to benzene (OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.6), radioactive materials (OR=3.7, 95% CI=1.3-10.2), synthetic fiber dust (OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.2-3.5), and toluene (OR=1.6, 95% CI=1.0-2.5). Dose-response relations of leukemia risk was observed with the duration of exposure to benzene (OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.6-6.9 for >or=15 years exposure; p for trend<0.01), radioactive materials (OR=5.2, 95% CI=1.1-24.7 for >or=15 years exposure; p for trend=0.02), paints (OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.2-4.7 for >or=15 years exposure; p for trend=0.09), and toluene (OR=2.9, 95% CI=1.3-6.7 for >or=15 years exposure; p for trend=0.02).

In contrast to other cell surface components such as lectins or proteoglycans that influence infections indirectly by enhancing virus adsorption onto specific cells, the true receptors induce conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoproteins that are essential for infection. One surprise is that all of the cell surface receptors for gamma-retroviruses are proteins that have multiple transmembrane (TM) sequences, compatible with their identification in known instances as transporters for important solutes. In striking contrast, almost all other animal viruses use receptors that exclusively have single TM sequences, with the sole proven exception we know of being the coreceptors used by lentiviruses. This evidence strongly suggests that virus genera have been prevented because of their previous evolutionary adaptations from switching their specificities between single-TM and multi-TM receptors. This evidence also implies that gamma-retroviruses formed by divergent evolution from a common origin millions of years ago and that individual viruses have occasionally jumped between species (zoonoses) while retaining their commitment to using the orthologous receptor of the new host. Another surprise is that many gamma-retroviruses use not just one receptor but pairs of closely related receptors as alternatives. This appears to have enhanced viral survival by severely limiting the likelihood of host escape mutations. All of the receptors used by gamma-retroviruses contain hypervariable regions that are often heavily glycosylated and that control the viral host range properties, consistent with the idea that these sequences are battlegrounds of virus-host coevolution. However, in contrast to previous assumptions, we propose that gamma-retroviruses have become adapted to recognize conserved sites that are important for the receptor's natural function and that the hypervariable sequences have been elaborated by the hosts as defense bulwarks that surround the conserved viral attachment sites. Previously, it was believed that binding to receptors directly triggers a series of conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoproteins that culminate in fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. However, new evidence suggests that gamma-retroviral association with receptors triggers an obligatory interaction or cross-talk between envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface. If this intermediate step is prevented, infection fails. Conversely, in several circumstances this cross-talk can be induced in the absence of a cell surface receptor for the virus, in which case infection can proceed efficiently. This new evidence strongly implies that the role of cell surface receptors in infections of gamma-retroviruses (and perhaps of other enveloped animal viruses) is more complex and interesting than was previously imagined. Recently, another gammaretroviral receptor with multiple transmembrane sequences was cloned. See Prassolov, Y., Zhang, D., Ivanov, D., Lohler, J., Ross, S.R., and Stocking, C.

In the setting of autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), prophylactic use of acyclovir, immunoglobulin and ST was not routine and was reduced in duration, if used at all, as compared with allogeneic SCT.

This review will discuss the anticipated results from allogeneic HSCT by summarizing outcomes in aplastic anemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia as well as a brief description of Seattle's experience with allogeneic HSCT in the first two patients with systemic sclerosis.","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D1-100, PO Box 19024, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']",,18,['HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

High hyperdiploidy is the most common genetic abnormality in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Evidence for an in utero initiation of this important genetic event in ALL is available from blood spots but remains limited. Twin children with hyperdiploid ALL have not hitherto been reported. We describe a pair of 2-year-old monozygotic twins with concordant B-cell precursor ALL and hyperdiploid karyotypes. One twin's leukemic cells had two rearranged TCRD alleles and one of these was a clonotypic Vdelta2-Ddelta3 sequence shared with leukemic cells of the other twin. The twins' leukemic cells had several different IGH V(H)-J(H) rearrangements but shared two common D(H)-J(H) 'stem' sequences. We conclude that ALL in these twins is likely to have originated prenatally in one fetus before spreading to the other via intraplacental anastomoses. It is likely that one or more additional postnatal genetic events was required for overt leukemogenesis.,"['Chester Beatty Laboratories, Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a small molecule (HA14-1) was reported to bind the surface pocket of Bcl-2 that mediates antiapoptotic interactions, triggering apoptosis in a Bcl-2-transfected cell line. We investigated the activity of this compound in a panel of malignant hematopoietic cell lines. Consistent with its proposed role as a Bcl-2 inhibitor, HA14-1 was most cytotoxic in lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2. In addition, at lower concentrations (5-12.5 muM), the compound predominantly triggered apoptosis. However, at concentrations two-fold higher than this and above, increasing primary necrosis was observed, suggesting the onset of interactions supplementary to Bcl-2 inhibition. In experiments on primary cells, 25 muM HA14-1 induced extensive apoptosis in acute leukemic blasts, but also suppressed normal hematopoietic colony formation to <50% of baseline. Importantly, low-concentration HA14-1 (5 muM) was nontoxic to normal colony-forming cells, whereas it enhanced the cytotoxicity of the antileukemia drug cytarabine in Bcl-2-positive lymphoblastic leukemia cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that HA14-1 at low concentration selectively triggers apoptosis in malignant hematopoietic cells that overexpress Bcl-2. Agents of this class may have particular utility in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs.","['Leukaemia Foundation Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidence of bacteremia was 25% (95% CI 17-33%), occurring at a median of 67 (range 7-172) days, while patients had recovered a full neutrophil count.

In multivariate analysis, stem cell source (bone marrow; P=0.0002) was significantly associated with the risk of positive CMV antigenemia, while higher doses of prednisone (>2 mg/kg) represented the major risk factor for bacteremia (P=0.0001). Infectious-related mortality was 5% (95% CI 1-9%), with aspergillosis being the principal cause.

We demonstrate that in normal monocytic cells, protein kinase C (PKC)-induced p21 gene activation, which is nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) independent, results in predominantly cytoplasmic localized p21 protein. In acute monocytic leukaemia (M4, M5), monocytic blasts (N=12) show constitutive cytoplasmic p21 expression in 75% of the cases, while in myeloid leukaemic blasts (N=10), low nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of p21 could be detected, which is also PKC dependent. Constitutive p21 expression in monocytic leukaemia might have important antiapoptotic functions. This is supported by the finding that in U937 cells overexpressing p21, VP16-induced apoptosis is significantly reduced (20.0+/-0.9 vs 55.8+/-3.8%, P<0.01, N=5), reflected by a reduced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Similarly, AML blasts with high cytoplasmic p21 were less sensitive to VP16-induced apoptosis as compared to AML cases with low or undetectable p21 expression (42.25 vs 12.3%, P<0.01). Moreover, complex formation between p21 and ASK1 could be demonstrated in AML cells, by means of coimmunoprecipitation. In summary, these results indicate that p21 has an antiapoptotic role in monocytic leukaemia, and that p21 expression is regulated in a PKC-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent manner.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several laboratories have demonstrated that Akt inhibits transcriptional activation of a number of related forkhead transcription factors now referred to as FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4. Akt-regulated forkhead transcription factors are involved in the control of the expression of both the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27(Kip1) and proapoptotic Bim protein. Very little information is available concerning the importance of the PI3K/Akt pathway in HL60 human leukemia cells. Here, we present our findings showing that the PI3K/Akt axis regulates cell cycle progression of HL60 cells through multiple mechanisms also involving the control of FoxO1 and FoxO3. To this end, we took advantage of a HL60 cell clone (HL60AR cells) with a constitutively activated PI3K/Akt axis. When compared with parental (PT) HL60 cells, HL60AR cells displayed higher levels of phosphorylated FoxO1 and FoxO3. In AR cells forkhead factors localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas in PT cells they were mostly nuclear. AR cells proliferated faster than PT cells and showed a lower amount of the cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1), which was mainly found in the cytoplasm and was hyperphosphorylated on threonine residues. AR cells also displayed higher levels of cyclin D1 and phosphorylated p110 Retinoblastoma protein. The protein levels of cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 were not altered in HL60AR cells, whereas the activities of both ckd2 and cdk6 were higher in AR than in PT cells. These results show that in HL60 cells the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be involved in the control of the cell cycle progression most likely through mechanisms involving the activation of forkhead transcription factors.","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia, Cell Signalling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects in apoptosis pathways make important contributions to chemoresistance, suggesting a need to restore apoptosis sensitivity or to identify alternative pathways for apoptosis induction. Triterpenoids represent a class of naturally occurring and synthetic compounds with demonstrated antitumor activity, including 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and its methyl ester (CDDO-m). We explored the effects of CDDO and CDDO-m in vitro on established AML cell lines (HL-60, U937, AML-2) and on freshly isolated AML blasts. CDDO and CDDO-m reduced the viability of all AML cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner, with effective doses for killing 50% of cells (ED(50)) within 48 h of approximately 1 and 0.5 muM, respectively. CDDO or CDDO-m also induced substantial increases in cell death in five out of 10 samples of primary AML blasts. Cell death induced by CDDO and CDDO-m was attributed to apoptosis, based on characteristic cell morphology and evidence of caspase activation. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated proteolytic processing of caspase-3, -7, and -8, but not caspase-9, suggesting the involvement of the 'extrinsic' pathway, linked to apoptosis induction by TNF-family death receptors. Accordingly, CDDO and CDDO-m induced concentration-dependent reductions in the levels of FLIP protein, an endogenous antagonist of caspase-8, without altering the levels of several other apoptosis-relevant proteins. Reductions in FLIP were rapid, detectable within 3 h after exposure of AML cell lines to CDDO or CDDO-m. CDDO and CDDO-m also sensitized two of four leukemia lines to TRAIL, a TNF-family death ligand. The findings suggest that synthetic triterpenoids warrant further investigation in the treatment of AML, alone or in combination with TRAIL or other immune-based therapies.","['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis induced by 1 microM of As(2)O(3) in NKM-1 cells was accompanied by an increased cellular content of H(2)O(2), a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), and activation of caspase-3. C-Jun-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated only in NKM-1 cells and arsenic-sensitive NB4 cells, but not in arsenic-insensitive HL-60 cells. Activation of JNK in NKM-1 was sustained from 6 to 24 h after As(2)O(3) treatment, and preceded changes in cellular H(2)O(2), Deltapsim, and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, addition of a JNK inhibitor reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells after the As(2)O(3) treatment. Taken together, in the M2 cell line NKM-1, 1 microM of As(2)O(3) induced sustained activation of JNK and apoptosis.

This assay was applied to 108 marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCLs), including 72 extranodal MALT lymphomas, 17 nodal, and 19 splenic MZBCL. In 19 MALT lymphomas (26%), but in none of the nodal or splenic MZBCL, separated hybridization signals of the MLT/MALT1 flanking probes, were found.

The frequency at which these translocations occurred varied significantly with the primary location of disease.

For the p66/p51 and p66/p66 dimeric forms of HIV-1 RT, both the structural and functional target sizes corresponded to that of the dimeric protein, indicating that a primary ionization in one subunit of the HIV-1 RT enzyme results in the concomitant polymer scission of both subunits. In contrast to p66/p51 and p66/p66 RT, the individually isolated p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT inactivated as a monomer. However, in the presence of a DNA template/primer substrate, the radiation inactivation analyses of p51 yielded a structural target size corresponding to that of a dimeric protein. This would indicate that the DNA substrate acted as a scaffold or template for p51 RT homodimer formation. In light of this observation, radiation inactivation studies can readily be applied to other DNA polymerase enzymes, such as the murine leukemia virus RT, for which the functional form of the enzyme has yet to be determined.","['University of Pittsburgh, Department of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",,,"['R01 GM068406/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 GM068406-01 A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a multicenter randomized trial, we assigned patients (age range, 18 to 60 years) with newly diagnosed AML to receive cytarabine plus idarubicin (cycle 1) and cytarabine plus amsacrin (cycle 2) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (321 patients) or without G-CSF (319). G-CSF was given concurrently with chemotherapy only. Idarubicin and amsacrin were given at the end of a cycle to allow the cell-cycle-dependent cytotoxicity of cytarabine in the context of G-CSF to have a greater effect. The effect of G-CSF on disease-free survival was assessed in all patients and in cytogenetically distinct prognostic subgroups. RESULTS: After induction chemotherapy, the rates of response were not significantly different in the two groups. After a median follow-up of 55 months, patients in complete remission after induction chemotherapy plus G-CSF had a higher rate of disease-free survival than patients who did not receive G-CSF (42 percent vs. 33 percent at four years, P=0.02), owing to a reduced probability of relapse (relative risk, 0.77; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99; P=0.04). G-CSF did not significantly improve overall survival (P=0.16). Although G-CSF did not improve the outcome in the subgroup with an unfavorable prognosis, the 72 percent of patients with standard-risk AML benefited from G-CSF therapy (overall survival at four years, 45 percent, as compared with 35 percent in the group that did not receive G-CSF [relative risk of death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.95; P=0.02]; disease-free survival, 45 percent vs. 33 percent [relative risk, 0.70]; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.90; P=0.006).

In 23 consecutive children with ALL, a bone biopsy was taken from the crista iliaca posterior under ketamine anesthesia, together with the diagnostic marrow aspiration, before any treatment was given. Histomorphometric assessment was done of bone volume, bone area, trabecular thickness, osteoid volume, osteoid area, osteoid width, number of osteoblasts, erosion area, and number of osteoclasts. Data were analyzed in age groups under and over 10 y and compared with biopsies from 15 children, obtained during the work-up for other malignancies (only patients without bone marrow involvement were included). In ALL patients, bone volume and trabecular thickness were decreased in children <10 y. In patients >10 y, these parameters were not significantly different from the controls; bone densitometry showed no significant loss of bone in patients >10 y as well. Numbers of osteoblasts and osteoid surface occupied with osteoblasts were reduced in both age groups, as was the number of resorbing osteoclasts. No indications of osteomalacia were found. Childhood ALL results in a reduced number of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, with a subsequent reduced osteoid formation and reduced bone resorption. This leads to a reduced bone volume and trabecular thickness, especially in younger children. In adolescents, the disturbance of bone (re)modeling is less serious, probably because of the strong stimulus on bone formation of sex hormones. The skeletal impairment at diagnosis is potentially reversible.","[""Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Hospital Groningen, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands. j.a.leeuw@bkk.azg.nl""]",,,,,20030820,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Firstly, REDLK at C-terminus of Pseudomonas exotoxin PE40 was replaced with KDEL using point mutagenesis technology. Secondly, a cDNA encoding interleukin-6 devoid of N-terminal 24 amino acids [IL6D24] was fused to 5' terminus of PE40KDEL DNA by the method of gene splicing by overlap extension, which could generate recombinant IL6D24-PE40KDEL and IL6D24-Linker-PE40KDEL fusion genes. Thirdly, recombinant fusion genes IL6D24-PE40KDEL and IL6D24-Linker-PE40KDEL were ligated into the EcoR I and Sma I cloning sites in the pBV220 plasmids respectively and then transformed into E.coli HB101 cells. The expressed recombinant exotoxin fusion proteins were purified to electrophoresis purity by Mono Q column chromatography. Its selectively killing was tested by the MTS colorimetric method using both U937 and CEM cells lines. RESULTS: Recombinant exotoxin fusion proteins IL6D24-PE40KDEL was expressed as a form of inclusion bodies at higher level of 40% approximately of total proteins in bacterial cells.

The median time between first MRD detection and relapse was 5.5 (range 0.5-30) months. In 23 patients without MRD, six have relapsed to date: lower sensitivity, central nervous system relapse and clonal exchange of the leukaemic clone were factors that may explain the failure to detect MRD before relapse in these patients. In univariate analysis, factors associated with decreased risk of relapse were transplantation in first remission (P=0.02), the combination of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (P=0.03) and absence of MRD after SCT (P=0.005). In multivariate analysis, only MRD detection after SCT was significantly associated with increased risk of relapse (P=0.05).

Hierarchical clustering analysis segregated the EPCs from the remaining samples, and revealed an expression pattern associated with angiogenesis in the EPCs, involving higher expression of the genes TIE2, NOTCH3, CD31 and endoglin. Direct comparison of EPC samples with the MM samples identified 156 genes significantly upregulated and 85 genes significantly downregulated (P < 0.005, t-test) in the EPCs, including several genes involved in angiogenesis and adhesion that were upregulated (including angiopoietin 1, SPARC, Notch3 and fibronectin 1). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated CD31 and endoglin protein expression in the EPC tumour cells, which are both angiogenesis related and could confer malignant plasma cells with the ability to grow outside the normal bone marrow environment.

Thus, various strategies have been explored for the in vitro expansion of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-specific T cells. In a popular approach, AML blasts have been genetically modified to express co-stimulatory molecules essential for effective T cell priming. One such tactic has been the modification of AML cells to express the B7/CD80 co-stimulatory molecule that binds to CD28 on T cells initiating events that culminate in enhanced cytokine production, proliferation and development of effector functions by T cells. The success of these strategies has been limited by difficulties in attaining sufficient transduction efficiencies and associated high levels of CD80 expression. We demonstrate that these problems can be circumvented by using anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, we show that the synergistic relationship between CD80/CD28 pathway and interleukin 12 cytokine (IL-12), documented in the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) for solid tumours, also applies to AML. CD28/IL-12 synergy facilitated the proliferation of allogeneic T cells in response to stimulation with primary AML blasts.

To search for such predictive markers, we examined peripheral blood and stool samples of individuals infected with both S. stercoralis and HTLV-1 in Okinawa, Japan, an area in which both of these are endemic. The HTLV-1 proviral load and antibody titre were examined in relation to the S. stercoralis load as measured by the direct faecal smear method in patients infected with both S. stercoralis and HTLV-1. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibody titre was also measured in these patients in order to examine the relationship between host immunity and HTLV-1 proviral load or antibody titre. The direct faecal smear-positive group showed both a higher HTLV-1 proviral load and HTLV-1 antibody titre than the -negative group (P < 0.05). In contrast, inverse correlations of these parameters with the EBNA antibody titre were observed, especially for proviral load (rho = -0.387, P < 0.05). These results suggest that HTLV-1 proviral load and antibody titre influence the S. stercoralis load via disturbance of the host immunity, and that proviral load would be an especially useful predictive marker of the risk of development of strongyloidiasis in patients infected with both S. stercoralis and HTLV-1.","['Department of Medical Zoology, Saitama Medical School, Saitama, Izumizaki Hospital, Okinawa, Japan. satoma@saitama-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angelicin is structurally related to psoralens, a well-known chemical class of photosensitizers used for their antiproliferative activity in treatment of different skin diseases (i.e., psoriasis and vitiligo). To verify the activity of angelicin, we employed two experimental cell systems, the human leukemic K562 cell line and the two-phase liquid culture of human erythroid progenitors isolated from normal donors. The results of our investigation suggest that angelicin, compared with cytosine arabinoside, mithramycin and cisplatin, is a powerful inducer of erythroid differentiation and gamma-globin mRNA accumulation of human leukemia K562 cells. In addition, when normal human erythroid precursors were cultured in the presence of angelicin, increases of gamma-globin mRNA accumulation and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production, even higher than those obtained using hydroxyurea, were detected. These results could have practical relevance, as pharmacologically-mediated regulation of the expression of human gamma-globin genes, leading to HbF induction, is considered a potential therapeutic approach in hematological disorders, including beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data regarding FasL expression in normal or neoplastic tissues remain controversial. In the present study, we investigated the expression of FasL in normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes or malignant cells of the B-lymphocyte lineage to elucidate a possible immunologic counterattack mechanism. FasL gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in two non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) entities: the highly aggressive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and indolent NHL chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). FasL expression was found to be consistently negative in all BL cell lines and purified samples from patients with CLL. FasL is not constitutively expressed in normal peripheral blood or neoplastic B lymphocytes making the Fas counterattack, as described for gastrointestinal cancer, unlikely as a mechanism of immunologic escape of lymphoma cells.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Ludwigs University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that internal tandem duplications and specific D-835 point mutations of the Flt3 gene, as well as the angioregulatory phenotype represent additional adverse prognostic factors. The aim of the study was to investigate possible associations between genetic abnormalities, differentiation status and angioregulatory phenotype in native human AML blasts. METHOD: Native AML blasts derived from consecutive patients were cultured in vitro and concentrations of angioregulatory molecules determined in the supernatants. RESULTS: Most patients released at least two different angioregulatory mediators. Pro-angiogenic interleukin 8 (IL8) was released at relatively high levels for most patients, many of these patients showed additional release of pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). High release of anti-angiogenic IL12 was associated with high release of pro-angiogenic IL8 and VEGF. Furthermore, patients with D-835 mutations showed increased IL12 release, whereas patients with normal karyotype had decreased HGF release. Myelomonocytic differentiation was associated with IL18 release and CD34 expression with low IL12 release. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that native human AML blasts have a pro-angiogenic phenotype. Although the investigated genetic abnormalities are associated with variation in the in vitro release of angioregulators, these differences are relatively small and do not quantitatively involve the most important IL8 release. It therefore seems unlikely that this phenotypic variation can explain the prognostic impact of the genetic abnormalities.","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. nils.idar.glenjen@helse-bergen.no']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The induction chemotherapy consisted of 2-CdA 5 mg/m2, Ara-C2 g/m2, and G-CSF. In the case of partial remission (PR), a second CLAG was administered. Patients in complete remission (CR) received two consolidation courses based on HD Ara-C, mitoxantrone or idarubicine, with or without 2-CdA. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients from 11 centers were registered; 50 primary resistant and eight early relapsed (CR1 < 6 months). CR was achieved in 29 (50%) patients, 19 (33%) were refractory, and 10 (17%) died early. Forty of 50 primary resistant patients received daunorubicin (DNR) and Ara-C as the first-line induction therapy (DA-7), 10 received additional 2-CdA (DAC-7). The CR rates after CLAG were 58% and 10%, respectively in each group (P = 0.015). Five of six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML achieved CR. Hematologic toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The overall survival (OS, 1 yr) for the 58 patients as a whole, and the 29 patients in CR were 42% and 65%, respectively. Disease-free survival (DFS, 1 yr) was 29%. Only first-line induction treatment with DA-7 significantly influenced the probability of CR after CLAG. None of the analyzed factors significantly influenced DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: CLAG regimen has significant anti-leukemic activity and an acceptable toxicity in refractory AML. The addition of 2-CdA to the first-line induction treatment may worsen the results of salvage with CLAG.

Two of the most prevalent cytogenetic subtypes of adult primary AML, t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), are characterized by disruption of the AML1(CBFA2, RUNX1) and CBFbeta genes, respectively, which encode subunits of core binding factor (CBF), a regulator of normal hematopoiesis. At the molecular level, t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) result in the creation of novel fusion genes, AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11, respectively, which encode fusion transcripts readily detectable by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although the detection of t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16) in adult patients with primary AML represents a favorable independent prognostic indicator for achievement of cure following intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation, a substantial number of these patients (i.e. 40-50%) relapse and eventually die of their disease. Therefore, timely identification and therapeutic stratification of those patients deemed at high risk for disease relapse could ultimately result in a further improvement of clinical outcome within these cytogenetic subgroups of AML. As relapse is likely to occur as the result of failure of treatment to completely eradicate leukemic blasts, the detection of the AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts using sensitive RT-PCR assays has been utilized as a surrogate marker for resistant disease and, in turn, to predict disease recurrence during remission. The purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of this strategy to the clinical management of t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) primary AML, here collectively referred to as CBF AML.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, and Arthur G.

UVA-induced apoptosis of T helper cells is believed to underlie the UVA phototherapy for atopic dermatitis and other T cell-mediated inflammatory skin diseases. We have evaluated the involvement of the Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathway in rapid UVA-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. UVA-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by pretreatment with a neutralizing anti-Fas antibody, although the same UVA treatment initiated cleavage of caspase-8 and subsequent processing of Bid and caspase-3-like proteases. Inhibition of caspase-8 by Lle-Glu (OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone completely blocked caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis in UVA-treated cells, suggesting that apoptosis was initiated by the Fas pathway. This inference was supported by demonstrating that immunoprecipitates obtained from UVA-treated cells using anti-Fas antibody contained caspase-8 and Fas-associating protein with death domain (FADD). In addition, Fas clustering in response to UVA treatment was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. These data support a mechanism for rapid, UVA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells involving initial formation of the Fas-FADD-caspase-8 death complex in an FasL-independent manner.","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",,,['GM30755/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

TRs (c-crbA isoforms) are derived from two separate gene loci in mammals: a and beta. Through a series of knockout experiments in mice in which one or several of the TR isoforms were deleted, it has been demonstrated that the TR-beta isoforms control central regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Of these isoforms, TR-beta2 is the most important in mediating negative feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Further analysis of TR knockout animals revealed, however, that they exhibited a much milder overall phenotype than hypothyroid animals, indicating that receptor loss was not equivalent to ligand loss in vivo. To understand this apparent paradox, we generated animals expressing a non-T3 binding receptor (delta337T) from the TR-beta allele. These mice displayed a complete hypothyroid phenotype, demonstrating that the unliganded TR mediates the effect of hypothyroidism. Because this mutant TR constitutively binds to nuclear coreprssors, it also suggests that this class of proteins is essential for mediating hypothyroidism in vivo.","['Section of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. fwondisf@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",,30,,,,,,,,,10.1136/jim-51-04-22 [doi],,

Vitamin C itself had no antiproliferative effect on the fibroblasts, but increased the anticancer effect of 5-FU dose-dependently. In the case of the chemoresistant cell line, only a high concentration of vitamin C increased the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. A combination of 5-FU and vitamin C exerted a significantly enhanced apoptotic effect on the mouse lymphoma cell line, whereas for the HEp-2 cell line this effect was less marked and was achieved only at a high concentration of vitamin C. These findings suggest that the administration of a high dose of vitamin C in combination with 5-FU chemotherapy enhances the chemoresponsiveness of cancer cells and serves as a potential sensitizer, especially in chemo-resistant cell lines.

The most recent discovery is a new compound, imatinib mesylate, which has become commercially available. Currently, the standard of care for CML is this agent. This therapy has changed management strategies for treatment of patients with the diagnosis of CML. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Long-term observations and evaluations are needed for final determination of treatment effectiveness; thus, primary care providers will follow patients with CML in the community.

Etoposide-mitoxantrone-cytarabine (EMA) timed sequential chemotherapy including a first sequence combining mitoxantrone (12 mg/m(2) per day over 3 days) with cytarabine (500 mg/m(2) per day over the same period), and a second sequence consisting in etoposide (200 mg/m(2) per day for 3 days) and cytarabine as in the first sequence, has been proposed as a salvage regimen. Over a 10-year period, 66 primary resistant AML patients have been treated by EMA salvage chemotherapy. All patients displayed intermediate- or high-risk karyotypic abnormalities. Of the 66 patients, 24 [36%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 25-49%] achieved complete remission (CR). Thirty-eight patients were resistant to EMA chemotherapy and four patients died from toxicity during aplasia. After CR achievement, 18 patients received consolidation therapy. Five patients with an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), one patient received autologous SCT, two patients received a second course of EMA chemotherapy, and ten were scheduled for 6-monthly maintenance courses (mini-EMA). Median follow-up was 7.3 years. At the time of analysis, 21 of the 24 patients (87%) who achieved CR have relapsed. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 5 months (95% CI: 4.3-7.7 months). Median overall survival (OS) was 5 months (95% CI: 3.8-6.7 months). There were only two long-term remitters (3%). In the univariate analysis, CR achievement was mainly related to white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of starting salvage therapy with poorer outcome for patients with more aggressive leukemia (WBC count > or =10 x 10(9)/l) (CR rates: 50% vs 10%, p<0.001). Overall survival was also influence by WBC count (median OS: 7.2 months vs 2.8 months, respectively, for WBC <and > or =10 x 10(9)/l, p<0.0001). Initial karyotype was not a significant prognostic factor either for CR achievement or for DFS or OS when comparing patients with normal karyotype and those with chromosomal abnormality. In multivariate analysis, WBC count less than 10 x 10(9)/l with the absence of circulating blasts at the time of starting salvage therapy appeared to be of favorable prognostic value for CR achievement ( p=0.002), while WBC count less than 10 x 10(9)/l appeared to be of favorable prognostic value for survival ( p<0.0001). Using these two objective parameters of proven significance, we devised a prognostic system of immediate clinical utility for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapeutic choices. Patients with both factors (WBC count <10 x 10(9)/l and no circulating blasts) or with at least one at the time of starting salvage therapy had a CR rate of 50% and were therefore candidates for intensified post-remission therapy. All other patients displayed a very poor outcome and must be oriented after failure of first-line therapy to alternate therapeutic programs based on investigational drugs.","['Leukemia Unit, Hematology Department, Edouard Herriot Hospital, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03, France.']",,,,,20030819,,,,,,,,

We show that a majority of CFU-S12 multipotential progenitor cells can be transduced in vitro. Uniquely, transduction of TVA+ progenitors with a retrovirus encoding a puromycin resistance gene allows selection and expansion of a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor population that can be superinfected with high efficiency. Using this system we show for the first time that v-Myb oncoproteins expressed from avian viruses can induce a leukemic transformation in the mouse. The phenotype of the transformed cells is similar to that which is seen in the chicken and is likewise dependent on the particular structure of v-Myb.

Conversely, however, some leukemia cell lines including the Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi continuously uptake patches of autologous cell membranes. This intercellular transfer does not involve cytosol molecules or exosomes, but requires cell contact. In homotypic Daudi cell conjugates, this occurs through immunological synapses, involves constitutive protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase activity and strongly increases upon B cell receptor activation.

With this as a background, we performed cDNA microarray analyses on mouse bone marrow tissue during and after a 2-week benzene exposure by inhalation. Our goal was to clarify the mechanisms underlying the hematotoxicity and leukemogenicity induced by benzene at the level of altered multigene expression. Because a few researchers have postulated that the cell cycle regulation mediated by p53 is a critical event for benzene-induced hematotoxicity, the present study was carried out using p53-knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 mice. On the basis of the results of large-scale gene expression studies, we conclude the following: (a) Benzene induces DNA damage in cells at any phase of the cell cycle through myeloperoxidase and in the redox cycle, resulting in p53 expression through Raf-1 and cyclin D-interacting myb-like protein 1. (b) For G1/S cell cycle arrest, the p53-mediated pathway through p21 is involved, as well as the pRb gene-mediated pathway. (c) Alteration of cyclin G1 and Wee-1 kinase genes may be related to the G2/M arrest induced by benzene exposure. (d) DNA repair genes such as Rad50 and Rad51 are markedly downregulated in p53-KO mice. (e) p53-mediated caspase 11 activation, aside from p53-mediated Bax gene induction, may be an important pathway for cellular apoptosis after benzene exposure. Our results strongly suggest that the dysfunction of the p53 gene, possibly caused by strong and repeated genetic and epigenetic effects of benzene on candidate leukemia cells, may induce fatal problems such as those of cell cycle checkpoint, apoptosis, and the DNA repair system, finally resulting in hemopoietic malignancies. Our cDNA microarray data provide valuable information for future investigations of the mechanisms underlying the toxicity and leukemogenicity of benzene.","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,['Environ Health Perspect. 2003 Aug;111(11):A590-1.

However, with the exception of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), our current knowledge of factors such as inter-patient pharmacokinetic variability and cellular determinants of chemosensitivity has not been utilized in the design of integrated clinical studies. Recent pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of the topoisomerase I inhibitors topotecan and irinotecan has highlighted the potential importance of pharmacological factors in their effectiveness as cytotoxics. In this review, the clinical and cellular pharmacology of vincristine, actinomycin D, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide will be discussed in relation to the major paediatric solid tumours. For each disease type, knowledge of the clinical and cellular pharmacology of a candidate drug will be related to pharmacodynamic responses such as response, toxicity and prognosis. For diseases such as Wilms' tumour, osteogenic sarcoma and Ewing's tumour, histological response to initial induction chemotherapy is of prognostic significance, and the depth of response is increasingly recognised as an important determinant of prognosis for high-risk neuroblastoma. For several of these tumour types, the dose-intensity of chemotherapy may be an important variable in determining prognosis. However the relationship between pharmacokinetic variability, cellular pharmacology and the major determinants of chemosensitivity to those drugs employed in first line therapy is unknown. The study of these relationships, by means of up front window studies in children who present with high-risk disease, may be as important as the introduction of new agents. Indeed, the optimisation of current therapies may be required to allow a fully informed selection of those children for whom novel therapies are truly needed. Funding and international collaboration at the clinical and scientific level would be required to achieve these aims.","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Pendlebury, Manchester, M27 4HA, UK. eestlin@mch.srht.nwest.nhs.uk""]",,191,,,,,,,,,,,

The motivation for studying this problem came from an investigation into a new therapy for acute leukemia in children. The background to this study is discussed. There were two groups of patients: one group already received heavy prior therapy while the second group had received relatively much lighter prior therapy. It was therefore anticipated that the second group would have an MTD higher or at least as high as the first. Generally, likelihood methods or, equivalently, the use of noninformative Bayes priors, can be used to model the main aspects of the study, i.e., the MTD for one of the groups, reserving more informative Bayes modeling to be applied to the secondary features of the study. These secondary features may simply be the direction of the difference between the MTD levels for the two groups or, possibly, information on the potential gap between the two MTDs.","['Department of Biostatistics, Institut Curie, 75005 Paris, France. oquigley@galois.ucsd.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assume the statistical method provides us with a normally distributed estimate, theta, and an estimate of its variance sigma. We randomly select a data point from each cluster and apply our statistical method to this independent data. We repeat this multiple times, and use the average of the associated theta's as our estimate. An estimate of the variance is given by the average of the sigma2's minus the sample variance of the theta's. We call this procedure multiple outputation, as all ""excess"" data within each cluster is thrown out multiple times. Hoffman, Sen, and Weinberg (2001, Biometrika 88, 1121-1134) introduced this approach for generalized linear models when the cluster size is related to outcome. In this article, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the approach. Applications to angular data, p-values, vector parameters, Bayesian inference, genetics data, and random cluster sizes are discussed. In addition, asymptotic normality of estimates based on all possible outputations, as well as a finite number of outputations, is proven given weak conditions. Multiple outputation provides a simple and broadly applicable method for analyzing clustered data. It is especially suited to settings where methods for clustered data are impractical, but can also be applied generally as a quick and simple tool.","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 6700B Rockledge Drive MSC 7609, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. dfollmann@niaid.nih.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation of HL-60 cells exposed to carboplatin dropped down with increasing dose of the drug. This effect was slightly higher when carboplatin was used in combination with amifostine. The cytotoxic index (IC50) was estimated as 6.6 and 4.4 x 10(-4) M (after 24 h) and 3.3 and 2.5 x 10(-5) M (after 48 h) for carboplatin and carboplatin with amifostine, respectively. This effect was accompanied by induction of caspase 3 activity. HL-60 cells treated with carboplatin alone showed about 120-fold increase in caspase 3 activity. Combination of carboplatin with amifostine induced the enzyme activity up to 280 times. Furthermore, the expression of bcl-2, c-myc and bax genes involved in apoptosis as well as p65, which function in this process is unknown, were determined. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed a decrease in bcl-2 and an increase in bax, c-myc and p65 expression in HL-60 cells treated with carboplatin in combination with amifostine as compared to the cells treated only with carboplatin. We conclude that amifostine may potentiate carboplatin therapeutic efficiency towards human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Molecular Biology Laboratory, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, PL 90-151 Lodz, Poland. mirowski@ich.pharm.am.lodz.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report five cases of pediatric acute leukemia with hepatosplenic microabscesses in children aged 4 years to 18 years. These patients presented with prolonged fever and neutropenia after antineoplastic chemotherapy, followed by abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly and hepatic dysfunction. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated multiple small lesions compatible with hepatosplenic candidiasis in all of the patients. Cultures, including blood or stool cultures, were positive in only two cases. Treatment with intravenous antifungal agents, including amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, and/or fluconazole were successful in two cases. These two patients remained event-free and survived for more than 24 months (20 months and 22 months after infection was diagnosed). The duration of systemic antifungal medication administration ranged from 3 months to 22 months. The serial image examinations revealed drastic reductions in small residual lesions in the two patients who survived the longest. The major issues for these patients were how long the antifungal therapy should be administered for, and how to select the optimal drug and dosage to avoid hepatic and renal toxicity. Among our patients, alternative therapy with amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, and fluconazole was used according to the patients' conditions, and the duration of antifungal therapy was determined by clinical manifestations and imaging study changes.","['Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: FLT3 mutations were detected in 31% of patients, more frequently in patients < 60 years and at standard cytogenetic risk. Among 92% of patients MDR1-positive, 50% expressed high levels of mRNA. No significant correlation was found between FLT3 mutations and high levels of MDR1. FLT3 or MDR1 mutations failed to show any role concerning the CR achievement and OS. On the contrary, a significant disadvantage for DFS was found in the group of patients carrying FLT3/ITD.

Analysis at the mRNA level by RT-PCR showed the expression of six cell membrane-associated PGs: syndecan-1, -2 and -4, glypican-1, thrombomodulin and CD44. Cell extraction, ion-exchange chromatography and dot blot analysis of the isolated PG populations with monoclonal antibodies showed the presence of syndecan-1 and thrombomodulin; the other two syndecans were not detected in any of the isolated populations. The synthesis of matrix PGs was also studied. THP-1 monocytes were positive for the mRNA encoding for versican and perlecan, but not for those encoding for decorin, biglycan, betaglycan and fibromodulin. The mRNA encoding for two versican splice variants V0 (351 bp) and V1 (386 bp), but not for V2, were identified. Biochemical analysis showed the presence of perlecan and of two populations of versican in culture medium with protein cores of average molecular sizes similar to those of V0 and V1. The production of these large matrix PGs by THP-1 monocytes is reported for the first time and may be of importance in monocyte malignant transformation and differentiation.","['Department of Chemistry, Section of Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry & Natural Products, University of Patras, 26500 Patras, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we describe the effects of Ac-ESG on growth-related gene expression and cell cycle progression in two lymphoma cell lines, Ramos and Molt, representing B and T lymphocytes, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted from Molt and Ramos cells with or without the tripeptide treatment. Gene expression was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization, and cell cycle progression was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the Molt cells, p53 gene expression was increased following treatment while c-myc was decreased after treatment shorter than 24 hours; N-ras expression was significantly reduced at picomolar concentration for 24-hour treatment; cyclinD1 and cdk4 expression did not show any change; DNA flow cytometry demonstrated that Molt cells were arrested or delayed predominantly in G2-M. Untreated Ramos cells had higher gene expression levels of c-myc, N-Ras and cdk4 than Molt cells, but lower p53 expression. These cells were not sensitive to Ac-ESG. CONCLUSION: The tripeptide Ac-ESG alters the expression of several growth-related genes in the Molt cell line and brings about an arrest or delay of cells in G2-M.","['Institute of Pediatric Research, National Hospital, University of Oslo, N-0027 Oslo, Norway.

LMO4, the fourth member of this family, is overexpressed in more than 50% of sporadic breast cancers, suggesting a role in breast oncogenesis. We recently found that LMO4 interacts with the breast/ovarian tumor suppressor BRCA1 and that LMO4 can repress its transcriptional activity. Since proto-oncogene deregulation can result from activating mutations in their coding or regulatory sequences, we explored whether the LMO4 gene undergoes somatic mutagenesis in breast cancer. Mutation analysis of the coding and 3' untranslated regions of the LMO4 gene was performed on 82 primary breast and 22 tumor cell lines. A somatic mutation was detected in one primary breast cancer, at the 3' end of exon 2, but was not present in normal DNA derived from the same patient. This mutation causes a frame-shift and potentially results in a truncated LMO4 polypeptide, LIM1(mut), lacking the second LIM domain. This mutant protein could still bind Ldb1 but no longer associated with CtIP or BRCA1. Our results show that somatic mutations within the LMO4 gene do occur in breast cancer but at a very low frequency. Thus, the primary mechanism by which LMO4 is deregulated in breast cancers appears to reflect overexpression of the gene rather than the acquisition of activating genetic mutations.","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Parkville, Australia.']","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sharing a high level of genetic homology with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), it is etiologically linked to the development of simian T cell malignancies that closely resemble HTLV-1 associated leukemias and lymphomas and might thus constitute an interesting model of study. The precise nature of STLV-1 replication in vivo remains unknown. The STLV-1 circulating proviral load of 14 naturally infected Celebes macaques (Macaca tonkeana) was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The mean proportion of infected peripheral mononuclear cells was 7.9%, ranging from <0.4% to 38.9%. Values and distributions were closely reminiscent of those observed in symptomatic and asymptomatic HTLV-1 infected humans. Sequencing more than 32 kb of LTRs deriving from 2 animals with high proviral load showed an extremely low STLV-1 genetic variability (0.113%). This paradoxical combination of elevated proviral load and remarkable genetic stability was finally explained by the demonstration of a cell-associated dissemination of the virus in vivo. Inverse PCR (IPCR) amplification of STLV-1 integration sites evidenced clones of infected cells in all infected animals. The pattern of STLV-1 replication in these asymptomatic monkeys was indistinguishable from that of HTLV-1 in asymptomatic carriers or in patients with inflammatory diseases. We conclude that, as HTLV-1, STLV-1 mainly replicates by the clonal expansion of infected cells; accordingly, STLV-1 natural monkey infection constitutes an appropriate and promising model for the study of HTLV-1 associated leukemogenesis in vivo.","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Virale, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.""]","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that donor-derived CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells inhibit lethal GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II barriers in mice. Here we demonstrate that in host mice with leukemia and lymphoma, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress the early expansion of alloreactive donor T cells, their interleukin-2-receptor (IL-2R) alpha-chain expression and their capacity to induce GVHD without abrogating their GVT effector function, mediated primarily by the perforin lysis pathway.

Scapinin was down-regulated by differentiation in HL-60 cells.

These observations formed the basis for exploring the role of DLI first in relapsed allogeneic transplant patients with other hematologic malignancies, then as prophylaxis for patients at high risk for relapse and then as adjunctive therapy for transplant strategies utilizing non-myeloablative conditioning regimens.

In MRL/lpr mice, which are radiosensitive (<8.5 Gy) and are an animal model for autoimmune diseases, conventional BMT resulted in only transient effects; the manifestations of the autoimmune diseases recurred 3 months after BMT. Using MRL/lpr mice, we have very recently established a new strategy for allo BMT. We injected bone marrow cells (BMC) directly into the bone marrow cavity (intrabone marrow [IBM] injection) of recipients that had received fractionated irradiation. This 'IBM-BMT' was found to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases in radiation-sensitive and chimeric-resistant MRL/lpr mice. In addition, this strategy was found to be applicable for the transplantation of organs. We believe that these strategies for BMT and organ transplantation herald a new era in transplantation.","['First Department of Pathology, Transplantation Center, Regeneration Research Center for Intractable Diseases, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi City, Osaka, Japan. ikehara@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",,32,,,,,,,,,,,

This study illustrates how scFISH probes detect cryptic and subtle abnormalities and localize the sites of chromosome rearrangements. scFISH probes are substantially shorter than conventional recombinant DNA-derived probes, and C(o)t1 DNA is not required to suppress repetitive sequence hybridization. In this study, 74 single copy sequence probes (>1,500 bp) have been developed from >/=100 kb genomic intervals associated with either constitutional or acquired disorders. Applications of these probes include detection of congenital microdeletion syndromes on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 15, 17, 22 and submicroscopic deletions involving the imprinting center on chromosome 15q11.2q13. We demonstrate how hybridization with multiple combinations of probes derived from the Smith-Magenis syndrome interval on chromosome 17 identified a patient with an atypical, proximal deletion breakpoint. A similar multi-probe hybridization strategy has also been used to delineate the translocation breakpoint region on chromosome 9 in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Probes have also been designed to hybridize to multiple cis paralogs, both enhancing the chromosomal target size and detecting chromosome rearrangements, for example, by splitting and separating a family of related sequences flanking an inversion breakpoint on chromosome 16 in acute myelogenous leukemia. These novel strategies for rapid and precise characterization of cytogenetic abnormalities are feasible because of the sequence-defined properties and dense euchromatic organization of single copy probes.","[""Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, Missouri, USA. jknoll@cmh.edu""]","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['1 R21 CA095167-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with high resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry has been applied as a powerful approach for the analysis of cryoglobulins. While FT-ICR mass spectrometry has been shown to enable the high resolution identification and structure analysis of biopolymers using both electrospray (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), the recently developed MALDI-FT-ICR source is shown here to provide high (sub-ppm) mass determination accuracy and isotopic fine structure as particular advantages in the identification of proteins. The main protein components in a serum cryoprecipitate from a patient with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and presenting type II cryogobulinemia are immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG which were identified by MALDI-FT-ICR MS analysis after separation by 2-DE as mu- and gamma-heavy chains, kappa- and lambda-light chains, and J-chains. Furthermore, complementarity determining regions CDR1 and CDR2 from monoclonal IgM-RF variable region (V)L were directly identified using accurate mass determinations by FT-ICR-MS.

Here, we generated seven different genetically modified Ad vectors with RGD sequences inserted into the HI loop of fiber knob. All mutants bound and infected CAR and alphav integrin-positive epithelial cells with equal efficiencies. However, the Ads containing two additional cysteines, both N and C terminals of the RGD sequence (RGD-4C), were uniquely capable of transducing CAR-less hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic human tumor cell lines and primary melanoma cells. Both binding and transduction of RGD-4C Ad were blocked by soluble RGD peptides. Flow cytometry of cell surface integrins and virus binding to CAR-less cells in the presence of function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies indicated that the alphavbeta5 integrin, but not alphavbeta3, alphaIIbbeta3 or beta1,alpha5 or alpha6-containing integrins served as a functional transduction receptor of the RGD-4C Ads. However, in cells with low levels of alphavbeta5 integrin, the function-blocking anti-alphavbeta5 antibodies were not effective, unlike soluble RGD peptides. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the alphavbeta5 integrin is a functional transduction receptor of RGD-4C Ads in the absence of CAR, and that additional RGD receptors are targets of these viruses.

Our purpose was to develop multicolor cytofluorometric methods to evaluate intracellular TRACP enzymic activity using a fluorogenic cytochemical reaction in combination with immunochemical stains for distinct surface membrane antigens. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were the model TRACP-expressing cells studied. Intracellular TRACP activity was disclosed using naphthol-ASBI phosphate as substrate with fast red-violet LB salt as coupler for the reaction product. Before the TRACP enzymic reaction, surface antigens, CD86 and CD11c of DCs, were bound with specific fluorescent antibodies to test compatibility of surface labeling and intracellular staining. TRACP activity varied in DCs from donor to donor but was reproducible on repeated examinations of each sample. Samples could be stained for simultaneous analysis of surface antigens and intracellular TRACP activity, provided certain technical details were observed. The TRACP reaction time should not exceed 9 min and the cell number should not exceed 2 x 10(5)/100 micro l test. Fluorescent surface labels did not affect the intensity of the TRACP stain, but the intensity of some surface labels may be diminished by elution of low-affinity antibodies during the TRACP reaction. Readjustment of the threshold settings in triple-labeled cells is needed to compensate for this phenomenon. Intracellular TRACP activity can be quantitated in subpopulations of cells within mixed cell populations by flow cytofluorometry using simple cytochemical methods in combination with fluorescent antibodies to cell-surface and other differentiation antigens. The cytochemical method should be useful for basic investigations of differentiation, maturation, and function of macrophages, DCs, and osteoclasts, and for diagnosis and management of hairy cell leukemia.","['Special Hematology Laboratory, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky 40206, USA. anthony.Janckila@med.va.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The linear arrangement of the Hox genes on the chromosome correlates with the spatial distribution of HOX protein expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Most HOX proteins bind DNA cooperatively with members of the PBC family of TALE-type homeodomain proteins, which includes human Pbx1. Cooperative DNA binding between HOX and PBC proteins requires a residue N-terminal to the HOX homeodomain termed the hexapeptide, which differs significantly in sequence between anterior- and posterior-regulating HOX proteins. We report here the 1.9-A-resolution structure of a posterior HOX protein, HoxA9, complexed with Pbx1 and DNA, which reveals that the posterior Hox hexapeptide adopts an altered conformation as compared with that seen in previously determined anterior HOX/PBC structures. The additional nonspecific interactions and altered DNA conformation in this structure account for the stronger DNA-binding affinity and altered specificity observed for posterior HOX proteins when compared with anterior HOX proteins. DNA-binding studies of wild-type and mutant HoxA9 and HoxB1 show residues in the N-terminal arm of the homeodomains are critical for proper DNA sequence recognition despite lack of direct contact by these residues to the DNA bases. These results help shed light on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by HOX proteins and show how DNA-binding proteins may use indirect contacts to determine sequence specificity.","['Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205-2185, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,['PDB/1PUF'],,,

IDA and MEN 11079 were more active than DOXO in cytotoxicity tests (WST-1 assay). IDA and MEN 11079 ID(50) values were also significantly different from each other (K-562: P=0.038; MNCs: P=0.003). Moreover, the range was 0.002-4.300 microM for IDA and 0.002-0.670 microM for MEN 11079, in the MNCs. Therefore, the latter appeared to assure a smaller variability of response in the AML cells. Apoptosis assays (performed using Annexin-V assay and propidium iodide) and cell cycle studies demonstrated that the MEN 11079 effective concentration was 10-fold lower than the DOXO and IDA ones. MDR (Pgp and MRP1 proteins), as measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR, cytofluorimetric and functional analysis of proteins, was similarly elicited by IDA and MEN 11079. In conclusion, the response of the cells to the new anthracycline indicates that there is greater cytotoxic activity of this molecule than IDA and DOXO. Its narrower ID(50) range may allow for a more predictable response in the clinical setting.","['U.O.

Myelomonocytic differentiation was induced by phorbol ester (12-o-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, TPA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or interferon gamma (INFgamma), or their combination. Differentiation (with the exception of TNFalpha alone) was accompanied by inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with a decrease in the expression of cdc25A and cdc25B, cdk6 and Ki-67 genes, and with increased p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene expression, as measured by comparative RT-PCR. Expression of the following genes was not changed after induction of differentiation: cyclin A1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and p27(Kip1). Surprisingly, cyclin D1 expression was upregulated after induction by TPA, TNFalpha with IFNgamma or BA. Cyclin D2 was upregulated only after induction by BA. The results of the expression of the tested genes obtained by comparative RT-PCR were confirmed by quantitative real-time (RQ) RT-PCR and Western blotting. Quantitative RT-PCR showed as much as a 288-fold increase of cyclin D1 specific mRNA after a 24h induction by TPA. The upregulation of cyclin D1 in differentiating cells seems to be compensated by the upregulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1). These results, besides others, point to a strong correlation between the expression of cyclin D1 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) on the one hand and differentiation on the other hand in human myeloid leukemic cells and reflect a rather complicated network regulating proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic. ullman@uhkt.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been hypothesized that resistance of myeloblasts to VCR is related to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). We investigated the relationship between VCR degradation and MPO expression and serum HOCl concentrations in pediatric patients with ALL, lymphoma and solid tumors. We studied the sera from 43 children, of which 23 were newly diagnosed and as yet untreated cancer patients, 10 on chemotherapy and 10 healthy control subjects. Patients' sera were incubated with VCR alone or in the presence of taurine (T) or acetaminophen (APAP) and post-incubation VCR and HOCL concentrations were measured. Significant correlations between serum MPO expression, HOCl concentrations and VCR degradation were seen. In the chemotherapy group, MPO-positive patients produced high levels of HOCl and reciprocally low post-incubation VCR levels. HOCl and VCR concentrations in this group were significantly different than other groups studied. Both APAP and T inhibited VCR degradation in the sera of the chemotherapy group but not to the same degree. The effects seen here were consistent for both ALL and the lymphoma/solid tumor cases. Our results indicate that HOCl can increase VCR degradation in vitro in the serum and this effect is significantly more pronounced in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy.","['Department of Pediatrics, Inonu University Medical School, Malatya, Turkey. uozgen@inonu.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a positive correlation between the microvessel counts and the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow (r = 0.311, P < 0.01). The VEGF level in the bone marrow fluid in untreated AL patients (188.88 ng/L) was significantly higher than that in BMR AL patients (78.74 ng/L) and controls (79.52 ng/L) (P < 0.01), while the latter two groups had no difference between each other (P > 0.05). The VEGF level in the bone marrow fluid from ANLL group (270.12 ng/L) was enhanced significantly compared with that from ALL group (101.70 ng/L) (P < 0.01) and associated with the microvessel counts (r = 0.464, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Microvessel counts increased in the bone marrow in patients with different types of AL, suggesting that angiogenesis might play an important role in the pathology of AL. Testing the VEGF level in the bone marrow fluid from ANLL patients could reflect the degree of angiogenesis and disease condition.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China. jcai@mail.hz.zj.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old white woman with chronic myeloid leukemia who had been treated with hydroxyurea for 7 years was offered anagrelide to control thrombocytosis. She developed severe hypersensitivity pneumonitis soon after the drug was initiated and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated extensive multifocal ground glass attenuation and patchy alveolar consolidation involving both lungs. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a preponderance of lymphocytes, suggesting hypersensitivity phenomenon, but was otherwise negative for malignancy and other causes of interstitial pneumonitis. An objective causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug event was probable. Discontinuation of anagrelide and hydroxyurea, and institution of corticosteroid therapy resulted in dramatic improvement. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of severe hypersensitivity pneumonitis closely related to anagrelide therapy. Pulmonary infiltrates have rarely been noted in patients treated with anagrelide. Anagrelide does not depress white blood cell production, causes mild anemia, and is devoid of the leukemogenic potential characteristic of radioactive phosphorus and other alkylating agents. Common adverse effects to anagrelide include headache, nausea, diarrhea, peripheral edema, and palpitations. Frank congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy have occurred in a small number of patients, but severe pulmonary adverse effects have not emerged as a frequent problem. CONCLUSIONS: Vigilance is advised in patients who develop dyspnea while taking anagrelide and hydroxyurea. Healthcare providers need to be aware of the possibility of the development of serious life-threatening hypersensitivity pneumonitis. These patients may benefit from serial chest X-rays, pulmonary function testing, and echocardiography.","['Department of Critical Care Medicine, Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital, Johnstown, PA 15905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty-four patients with Ph + CML in chronic phase received oral administration of Imatinib 400 or 600 mg once a day for 18 months. RESULTS: In the early phase of Imatinib treatment, rates of severe leukopenia (leukocyte < 2.0 x 10(9) L-1), anemia (hemoglobin < 100 g.L-1) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet < 50 x 10(9) L-1) were 14.8%, 37.0% and 27.8%, respectively. Hemocytes recovered in most patients with continued therapy. Treatment was interrupted or dosage reduced in a few patients. The lower the hemoglobin and higher the platelet before the regime, the lower the nadir of leukocytes and hemoglobin counts during the treatment. The lower the platelet count before the regime, the lower the nadir of platelets during the treatment. Risk factors for severe leukopenia were thrombocytosis (> or = 500 x 10(9) L-1) and basophilia > or = 5% before the treatment. Risk factors for severe thrombocytopenia were thrombocytopenia (< 100 x 10(9) L-1) and basophilia > or = 5% before the treatment. During the 12-month treatment with Imatinib, the statistically significant lower probabilities of cytogenetic response were observed at all checked points in patients with severe leukopenia, at the end of 3 and 6 months in patients with anemia, at the end of 3 months in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Cytopenia is a common side effect in patients with CML in chronic phase treated with Imatinib mesylate. Severe leukopenia is associated with a sustained lower major cytogenetic response, whereas anemia and severe thrombocytopenia influence more for the first 6 months.","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. jhgo@sohu.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of hematologic malignancies in 607 patients diagnosed with cryoglobulinemia in a single institution. Clinical, histologic, and serologic characteristics of patients were recorded on a protocol form. Hematologic malignancies were diagnosed according to the Revised European-American Lymphoma/World Health Organization classification criteria. RESULTS: Of the total cohort of 607 patients with cryoglobulinemia, we retrospectively identified 27 patients (5%) in whom a hematologic malignancy was diagnosed, including 24 (89%) lymphoproliferative and 3 (11%) myeloid malignancies. Fifteen (56%) were men and 12 (44%) women, with a median age at diagnosis of hematologic malignancy of 67 years (range, 44 to 88 years). The identified hematologic malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 18), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), and 1 case each of multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Castleman disease, chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Of the 18 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there was a predilection for specific histologic types (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 8 cases and small lymphocytic lymphoma in 4) and a higher frequency of a primary extranodal origin in 6 (33%) cases. Conditions associated with hematologic malignancies were hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in 14 patients (52%) and systemic autoimmune diseases in 13 (48%), with both HCV and systemic autoimmune disease in 6 cases (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic neoplasia associated with cryoglobulinemia is defined by a clear predominance of lymphoproliferative disorders (mainly non-Hodgkin lymphoma), with substantial extranodal involvement and an elevated presence of immunologic markers.

We demonstrate here that cAMP causes a concomitant decline in the number of dividing non-neuronal cells, suggesting that inhibition of proliferation contributes to neuroprotection. Consistent with this hypothesis, a transient treatment with the antimitotic cytosine arabinoside, at concentrations that induce long-term repression of glial cell proliferation, mimicked the neuroprotective action of cAMP and also obviated the need for the cyclic nucleotide. Treatment with cAMP-elevating agents reduced the population of OX-42-positive microglial cells and the number of immature astrocytes expressing vimentin and low levels of the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The effect on the immature astrocytes, however, seemed essential for neuroprotection. Ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, which stimulate astrocyte differentiation without reducing cell proliferation, failed to reproduce the protective effects of the cyclic nucleotide. Cyclic AMP did not operate by counteracting the action of the astrocyte mitogen epidermal growth factor or by reducing activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. The neuroprotective and antiproliferative actions of cAMP, however, were closely mimicked by olomoucine and roscovitine, potent inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 that are structurally related to cAMP. Measurement of CDK1 activity confirmed that neuroprotection was closely correlated with inhibition of this kinase by cAMP. In summary, neuroprotection of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons by cAMP most probably requires the repression of presumptive astrocytes through inhibition of CDK1.","[""INSERM 289, Experimental Neurology and Therapeutics, Batiment Pharmacie, Hopital de la Salpetriere, 47 bd de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the underlying mechanisms of cellular drug resistance, the activation of various apoptotic parameters in leukemic cells from 50 children with ALL was studied after in vitro exposure with 4 important drugs in ALL therapy (prednisolone, vincristine, l-asparaginase, and daunorubicin). Exposure to each drug resulted in early induction of phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and mitochondrial transmembrane (Deltapsim) depolarization followed by caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inactivation in the majority of patients. For all 4 drugs, a significant inverse correlation was found between cellular drug resistance and (1) the percentage of cells with PS externalization (<.001 < P <.008) and (2) the percentage of cells with Deltapsim depolarization (.002 < P <.02). However, the percentage of cells with caspase-3 activation and the percentage of cells with PARP inactivation showed a significant inverse correlation with cellular resistance for prednisolone (P =.001; P =.001) and l-asparaginase (P =.01; P =.001) only. This suggests that caspase-3 activation and PARP inactivation are not essential for vincristine- and daunorubicin-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, resistance to 4 unrelated drugs is associated with defect(s) upstream or at the level of PS externalization and Deltapsim depolarization. This leads to decreased activation of apoptotic parameters in resistant cases of pediatric ALL.","[""Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Rm Sp2456, Dr Molewaterplein 60, PO Box 2060, 3000 CB Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,20030814,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the mechanism of action of adaphostin was investigated in greater detail in vitro. Initial studies demonstrated that adaphostin induced apoptosis in a variety of Bcr/abl- cells, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and cell lines as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples. Further study demonstrated that adaphostin caused intracellular peroxide production followed by DNA strand breaks and, in cells containing wild-type p53, a typical DNA damage response consisting of p53 phosphorylation and up-regulation. Importantly, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blunted these events, whereas glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) augmented them.

They were detected in all samples analyzed. However, no correlation was observed with cytogenetics, remission attainment, or overall survival of patients with AML. To investigate the importance of caspases in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in AML, we treated OCI-AML3 cells with Ara-C, doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel, which induced caspase cleavage and apoptosis. Blocking of caspase activation by pan-caspase inhibitor abolished poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase cleavage and DNA fragmentation but did not prevent chemotherapy-induced cell death and did not inhibit, or only partially inhibited, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, Smac, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), or loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase inhibition also did not protect AML blasts from chemotherapy-induced cell death in vitro. These results suggest that expression levels of Survivin or XIAP have no prognostic impact in AML patients. Although anticancer drugs induced caspase cleavage and apoptosis, cell killing was caspase independent.

IL-9 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNAs were also expressed at high levels in chronically infected cell lines. IL-5 mRNA was detected in 60% of the HTLV-1-infected cell lines, but mRNAs for IL-4, IL-10, IL-2, and IL-15 were either below detection limits or did not correlate with HTLV-1 infection.

Arsenic, a human carcinogen as well as an anticancer agent, is known for its clastogenicity. To better understand molecular mechanisms of arsenic actions, we investigated arsenite effects on telomere and telomerase and determined cell growth and apoptosis in HL-60 and HaCaT cells in vitro. Low concentrations (0.1-1 microM in HaCaT and 0.1-0.5 microM in HL-60) of arsenite increased telomerase activity, maintained or elongated telomere length, and promoted cellular proliferation. High concentrations (>1-40 microM) of arsenite decreased telomerase activity, telomere length and induced apoptosis. Results from the studies comparing cell lines with and without telomerase activity suggested that telomerase was involved in arsenic-induced apoptosis. The spin trap agent, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was effective in protecting the arsenite-induced telomere attrition and apoptosis, suggesting that reactive oxygen species may play an important role in the shortening of telomeres and apoptosis induced by arsenic. These findings suggest the carcinogenic effects of arsenic may be partly attributed to increase in telomerase activity leading to promotion of cell proliferation and its anticancer effects by exerting oxidative stress and leading to telomeric DNA attrition and apoptosis.","['National Research Council, 2001 Wisconsin Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",,,,,20030814,,,,,,,,

Balanced against the benefits of xenotransplantation are the possible consequences of zoonotic infections, and in particular, infection by porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). An often-proclaimed risk of PERV infection is the possible recombination of PERV with human endogenous retroviruses (HERV). To address this issue, we examined the potential for HERV sequences to be cross-packaged into PERV particles produced from infected human 293 cells. Although HERV-K, W, E, R, and ERV-9 RNA transcripts are expressed in 293 cells, we did not detect cross-packaging of any of these HERV groups. Quantitative analysis indicated that less than approximately 1 in 10(4)-10(7) PERV particles might contain HERV sequences. In comparison, we found that murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vector transcripts were cross-packaged at a rate of approximately one copy in 10(4) PERV particles. Our results indicate that the potential for recombination of PERV and HERV sequences is low and that novel viruses generated by this mechanism are unlikely to represent a significant risk for xenotransplantation.","['Immerge BioTherapeutics Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02129, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data demonstrate that cleavage of the TM cytoplasmic domain is not required for viral entry and provide evidence for a model in which fusogenic and nonfusogenic conformations of the envelope protein exists in an equilibrium that is regulated by the cytoplasmic domain.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To clarify the influence of the removal of DMSO by this method on the speed of engraftment in unrelated cord blood transplantation, 46 adult patients with cord blood units processed by the Tokyo Cord Blood Bank from September 1998 to March 31, 2002 were studied. Twenty-four patients received 2.6 +/- 0.71 x 10(7) nucleated cells per kg without washing (nonwashed group), while 22 patients were received 2.7 +/- 0.52 x 10(7) nucleated cells per kg after 2x dilution washing (washed group). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of engraftment was not significantly different between the two groups. Median neutrophil recovery (>/=5 x 10(9)/L) in the nonwashed and washed groups was 26 and 25 days, respectively, and the median platelet recovery (>/=20 x 10(9)/L) in patients with myeloid engraftment was 44 and 40 days, respectively (NS). On the other hand, the doses of CFCs and CD34+ cells showed the influence on myeloid and platelet recovery.

The monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1, IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were suggested to promote, each on its own, breast cancer progression. We recently demonstrated that the high-tumorigenicity phenotype of the DA3 and CSML murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells is correlated with a high expression of MCP-1, IL-6 and MMP. This raised the possibility that common intrinsic tumor-derived factors regulate the concordant expression of these 3 components. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the mode by which the secretion of MCP-1, IL-6 and MMP from murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells is regulated. This was investigated in cellular clones established from a highly malignant variant of the DA3 tumor (DA3-high). We also determined the secretion of the antimalignancy chemokine IP-10 from these cells. The results indicate that the secretion levels of IL-6, MMP and IP-10 varied between the clones. In contrast, all the clones secreted uniformly high levels of MCP-1, suggesting that MCP-1 constitutes an important feature of the malignancy phenotype of mammary carcinoma. In most of the clones, elevated levels of 1 of the 3 promalignancy factors did not correlate with a high expression of the other 2 factors and vice versa. These findings indicate that the 3 promalignancy factors are not coregulated by a common intrinsic tumor-derived factor. Rather, these results suggest that the individual capacities of the different clones to secrete these factors are summed up in the high-malignancy DA3 parental tumor population, which secretes relatively high levels of MCP-1, IL-6 and MMP as compared to DA3 cells expressing a low-malignancy phenotype. In contrast to the lack of coordinated intrinsic regulation of MCP-1, IL-6 and MMP, it was found that recombinant TNFalpha, a product of tumor-associated macrophages contributing to breast cancer progression, upregulated the secretion of MCP-1, IL-6 and MMP from all the clones. These results suggest a key role for this microenvironmental, monocyte-derived cytokine in the coordinated regulation of these 3 molecules. Furthermore, additional results demonstrated that monocytic cell-derived TNFalpha upregulated MCP-1 secretion from the tumor cells and that MCP-1 in turn promoted the secretion of TNFalpha from monocytic cells. This may result in a positive feedback loop, whereby the tumor cells and the monocytic cells at tumor site promote each other's ability to express and secrete promalignancy factors. We next attempted to assess the contribution of the promalignancy factors MCP-1, IL-6 and MMP and of the antimalignancy factor IP-10 to mammary adenocarcinoma progression. To this end, a preliminary formula was developed in which the net balance between secretion levels of the promalignancy factors and that of the antimalignancy IP-10 chemokine from different clones was related to their in vivo tumorigenicity profile. This formula suggests that a balance between the secretion levels of these factors plays an important role in determining the malignancy phenotype of mammary carcinomas. In all, our findings demonstrate that the mammary tumor cell population is composed of a heterogeneous assortment of clones whose individual characteristics are averaged in the whole population. The malignancy potential of such tumors is thus determined, inter alia, by a combinatorial effect of several promalignancy and antimalignancy factors secreted from each of the clones comprising these tumors. Our results also suggest that the expression of such factors is determined by several nonmutually exclusive regulatory mechanisms.","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S.

It is often poorly performed in practice. Various interventions have been developed that aim to enhance communication involving children or adolescents with cancer. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of interventions to enhance communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, its treatment and their implications. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2003; MEDLINE (1966 to January week 2 2003); EMBASE (1985 to 2003 week 4); CINAHL (1982 to December week 4 2002); Dissertation Abstracts (1861 to January 2003); ERIC (1966 to January 2003); PsycINFO (1985 to January week 4 2003); Sociological Abstracts (1963 to January 2003).For the initial (2001) publication of this review we also searched the following databases: PsycLIT; Cancerlit;; Sociofile; Health Management Information Consortium; ASSIA; LISA; PAIS; Information Science Abstracts; JICST; Pascal; Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts; Mental Health Abstracts; AMED; MANTIS. We also searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion, and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and before and after studies that evaluated the effects of interventions to enhance communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, treatment and related issues. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data relating to the interventions, populations and outcomes studied and the design and methodological quality of included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by another reviewer. A narrative summary of the results is presented. MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies met the criteria for inclusion. They were diverse in terms of the interventions evaluated, study designs used, types of people who participated and the outcomes measured. One study of a computer-assisted education programme reported improvements in knowledge and understanding about blood counts and cancer symptoms. One study of a CD-ROM about leukemia reported an improvement in children's feelings of control over their health. One study of art therapy as support for children during painful procedures reported an increase in positive, collaborative behaviour. Two out of two studies of school reintegration programs reported improvements in some aspects of psychosocial wellbeing (one in anxiety and one in depression), social wellbeing (two in social competence and one in social support) and behavioural problems; and one reported improvements in physical competence. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to enhance communication involving children and adolescents with cancer have not been widely or rigorously assessed. The weak evidence that exists suggests that some children and adolescents with cancer may derive some benefit from specific information-giving programs and from interventions that aim to facilitate their reintegration into school and social activities. More research is needed to investigate the effects of these and other related interventions.","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Warren Hall, Room 408, Berkeley, California 94707-7360, USA.']",,98,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008;(4):CD002969.

In order to determine whether G-quadruplex-interactive telomerase inhibitor, telomestatin (SOT-095), might have effects on telomere dynamics and to evaluate the clinical utility, we assessed the effects of telomestatin on BCR-ABL-positive human leukemia cells. We found that treatment with telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in the BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell lines OM9;22 and K562, resulting in telomere shortening. Inhibition of telomerase activity by telomestatin disrupts telomere maintenance and ultimately results in telomere dysfunction. Telomestatin completely suppressed the plating efficiency of K562 cells at 1 microM; however, telomestatin had less effects on BFU-Es and CFU-GMs colony formation from normal bone marrow CD34-positive cells. Enhanced chemosensitivity toward imatinib and chemotherapeutic agents was also observed in telomestatin-treated K562 cells. Further, the combination of telomestatin plus imatinib more effectively inhibited hematopoietic colony formation by primary human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Last, telomestatin induced the activation of ATM and Chk2, and subsequently increased the expression of p21(CIP1) and p27(KIP1). These results demonstrate that telomere dysfunction induced by telomestatin activates the ATM-dependent DNA damage response. We conclude that telomerase inhibitors combined with the use of imatinib and other chemotherapeutic agents may be very useful for the treatment of human leukemia.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. tauchi@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 regulates the expression of several hematopoietic genes and is essential for murine fetal liver hematopoiesis. We report here that the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, a mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster SU(VAR) 3-9, forms complex with AML1. SUV39H1 methylates lysine 9 of the histone protein H3 leading to the formation of the high-affinity binding site on chromatin for proteins of the heterochromatin protein 1 family (HP1). The interaction of AML1 with SUV39H1 requires the N-terminus of AML1 where the Runt domain is located. Binding of AML1 to SUV39H1 abrogates the transactivating and DNA-binding properties of AML1 and dissociates the net-like nuclear structure of AML1. It has been reported that AML1 is capable of interaction with histone acetyl transferases (CBP, p300, and MOZ) and with component of the histone deacetylase complex (Sin3), and that the interaction with these coregulators affects the strength of AML1 in promoter regulation. Our data suggest that other enzymes are also involved in gene regulation by AML1 activity by modulating the affinity of AML1 for DNA.","['Department of Pathology and The Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",,,"['CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified several fully human neutralizing anti-VEGF receptor 2 (or kinase inserting domain-containing receptor (KDR)) antibodies from a large antibody phage display library. These antibodies bind specifically to KDR, block VEGF/KDR interaction, and inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of human endothelial cells and migration of KDR+ leukemia cells. Three of these antibodies, interestingly, share an identical heavy chain variable (VH) sequence. In this report, we constructed a new library comprising the single VH paired with the variable light chain (VL) repertoire obtained from the original naive human library. Initial in vitro selection revealed that the single VH could pair with a number of different VL while retaining its specificity for KDR. However, a consensus VH/VL pair, clone 1121, was identified after three or four rounds of selection by tailoring the stringency of the panning conditions. Clone 1121 showed a >30-fold higher binding affinity to KDR (Kd, 100 pm) because of improvement on both association and dissociation constants and blocked VEGF/KDR interaction with an IC50 of approximately 1 nm, compared with that of 3-4 nm for the parent Fab fragments. Further, clone 1121 was more potent in inhibiting VEGF-stimulated KDR phosphorylation in endothelial cells. A binding epitope mapping study on clone 1121 and one of the parent clones, 2C6, demonstrated that both antibodies interacted with the third immunoglobulin domain within the extracellular region of KDR. Several peptide phage display libraries were utilized to further examine the fine binding specificities of the two antibodies. All of the 2C6-binding peptides are cysteine-constrained, whereas clone 1121 binds to both cysteine-constrained and linear peptides. It is noteworthy that most of the 2C6-binding peptides also cross-react with clone 1121, but none of the clone 1121-specific peptides binds to 2C6, indicating that clone 1121 retained part of the original binding epitope(s) of 2C6 while gaining new binding specificity.

We determined the long-term survival and the rates of health insurance coverage, marriage, and employment among patients who had attained at least 10 years of event-free survival. METHODS: A total of 856 eligible patients were treated between 1962 and 1992 in 13 consecutive clinical trials. Survival rates, the cumulative risk of a second neoplasm, and selected indicators of socioeconomic status were analyzed for the entire group and for patients who did or did not receive cranial or craniospinal radiation therapy during initial treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients had major adverse events, including 8 deaths during remission, 4 relapses, and 44 second neoplasms (41 of them radiation-related); most of the second neoplasms were benign or of a low grade of malignant potential. The risk of a second neoplasm was significantly higher in the 597 patients who received radiation therapy (irradiated group) than in the 259 patients who did not receive radiation therapy (nonirradiated group) (P=0.04; estimated cumulative risk [+/-SE] at 20 years, 20.9+/-3.9 percent vs. 0.95+/-0.9 percent). The death rate for the irradiated group slightly exceeded the expected rate in the general U.S. population (standardized mortality ratio, 1.90; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 3.00), whereas that for the nonirradiated group did not differ from the population norm (standardized mortality ratio, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 5.00). The rates of health insurance coverage, marriage, and employment in the nonirradiated group were similar to the age- and sex-adjusted national averages. Despite having health insurance rates similar to those in the general population, men and women in the irradiated group had higher-than-average unemployment rates (15.1 percent vs. 5.4 percent and 35.4 percent vs. 5.2 percent, respectively), and women in the irradiated group were less likely to be married (35.2 percent vs. 48.8 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who did not receive radiation therapy and who have attained 10 or more years of event-free survival can expect a normal long-term survival. Irradiation is associated with the development of second neoplasms, a slight excess in mortality, and an increased unemployment rate.","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,['21765/PHS HHS/United States'],['N Engl J Med. 2003 Sep 25;349(13):1299'],,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2003 Aug 14;349(7):627-8.

METHODS: The single base mutation polymorphism in TNFalpha gene and LTalpha gene were analyzed among 29 Chinese patients with ALL and 72 normal controls using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restrictive fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The clinical data were collected and survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: The difference of distribution of genotypes, alleles of TNFalpha(-308), LTalpha(+252), and TNF/LT polymorphic extended haplotypes between the ALL patients and control group were not statistically significant (P >0.05). In patients, no statistically significant association was found between the presence of a given TNF/LT haplotype status and clinical characters such as sex, white blood cell (WBC) counts, central nervous system involvement, and the response to therapy(P >0.05). The estimated 1-year overall survival rates in the groups of patients carrying high-risk and low-risk haplotypes were not statistically significant (P >0.05) using Kaplan-Meier method. In multivariate Cox regression models the TNF/LT haplotype status was not found to be a risk factor for outcome (P >0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the TNFalpha(-308) and LTalpha(+252) are not crucial in the pathogenesis, clinical course, and outcome of ALL patients.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown that the expression level of P-gp and its encoding gene MDR1 mRNA level are associated with the response of chemotherapy. But what we have observed in clinical practice is in contradiction with this. Besides, several recent reports have shown that the results of MDR functional assay are more predictive of chemotherapy outcomes than P-gp expression level. To examine the prognostic value of P-gp expression and MDR functional assay in acute leukemia, the authors determined the expression levels of P-gp and MDR function in 24 patients with de novo acute leukemia. The predictive value of MDR functional assay for chemotherapy outcomes was discussed. METHODS: The expression percentile of P-gp and the mean fluorescence intensity ratio of rhodamine 123 efflux assay [MIR(RE)] and intracellular daunorubicin accumulation assay [MIR(IDA)] of patients' leukemic cell samples were determined with flow cytometry. The results of remission (CR) and non-remission (NR) patients were compared. Correlative analysis was made between test results and chemotherapy outcomes. RESULTS: The expression levels of P-gp were not significantly different between CR and NR patients (2.16%+/-2.42% versus 15.02%+/-25.88%, P=0.114). But the MIR (RE) (1.16+/-0.38 versus 1.43+/-0.26, P=0.045) and MIR (IDA) (1.02+/-0.05 versus 1.47+/-0.44,P=0.005) were both significantly lower in CR patients than those in NR patients. Both MIR (RE) (r=0.590, P=0.006) and MIR (IDA) (r=0.867, P=0.000) were significantly correlated with chemotherapy outcomes. But the expression level of P-gp was not correlated with the chemotherapy results. CONCLUSION: The determination of MIR value of MDR functional assay is more valuable than P-gp expression level in predicting chemotherapy outcomes.","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510260, PR China. yexu2000@21cn.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now many references proved that cyclins are highly expressed in solid tumors. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between expression of cyclins and prognosis of acute leukemia. METHODS: Sixty-eight cases of acute leukemia were enrolled. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on tumor samples to examine the expression of cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E. All samples were divided into three groups: acute leukemia in complete remission (12 cases), newly diagnosed acute leukemia (16 cases) and refractory leukemia (40 case). Samples of benign hemopoietic patients were used as normal control (15 cases). RESULTS: All the 15 cases in the control group were negative of cyclin mRNA. No difference of cyclin A mRNA expression was shown between control group and the three experiment groups (P >0.05). But expression of cyclin D and cyclin E mRNA was significantly different between them (P< 0.01). There was no difference of expression of cyclin D and cyclin E mRNA among CR patients with acute leukemia(P >0.05), while the expression of cyclin D mRNA is significantly higher than that of cyclin E in refractory leukemia group.

Recent studies have shown that overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected in bone marrow from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, suggesting it may play an important role in AML. However,the effect of VEGF in the development of refractory leukemia is not clear. The current study was designed to explore the effect of overexpression of VEGF on the abnormal proliferation and harringtonine-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells and to observe VEGF expression in the progression of refractory AML. METHODS: HL-60 cells were transfected with the VEGF(165)cDNA sense vector (HL-60/VEGF(165)) and with the pcDNA3.1-vector (HL-60/neo) as the control using lipofectamine. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine VEGF mRNA. VEGF concentrations in the cell cultural supernatant were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell proliferation was determined by MTT and colony forming assay in vitro.Flow cytometric Annexin-V-FITC/PI dual labeling technique was performed to observe the effect of VEGF(165) cDNA transfection on harringtonine-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. ELISA was used to detect VEGF concentrations in the plasma from refractory and non-refractory AML patient. RESULTS: The mean VEGF concentration in the cell cultural supernatant of HL-60/VEGF(165) cells (399.07+/-12.45 ng/L) was 2-folds higher than that in HL-60/neo cells (184.45+/-10.53 ng/L)(P< 0.01). The VEGF(165)cDNA sense vector transfected HL-60 exhibited a 2-fold increase in VEGF secretion. The growth rate of HL-60/VEGF(165) cells was significantly higher than those of the controls, and colony formation capacity of HL-60/VEGF(165) increased significantly(P< 0.05);the colony numbers were (157.00+/-17.00)/500 cells and (110+/-12.90)/500 cells for HL-60/VEGF(165) and HL-60/neo, respectively. HL-60/VEGF(165) had less apoptotic cells than HL-60/neo in the same culture condition. High expression of VEGF could reduce the harringtonine-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Refractory AML patients had higher mean plasma VEGF levels (558.90+/-271.25 ng/L) than non-refractory patients(392.54+/-217.82 ng/L), and significant difference was observed between them (P< 0.05).

But its effectiveness was poor in patients with CML blast phase treated with Glivec alone. Glivec was reported having synergetic effect with other chemical agents in vitro, but there is few report in clinical combined application. In this paper, we analyzed effectiveness of Glivec in combination with homoharringtonine (HHT) and cytarabine (Ara-C) for patients with Ph chromosome positive acute leukemia (Ph(+)-AL), and investigated patients' tolerance to side effects of this trial. METHODS: A total of 20 patients (16 males and 4 females, median age was 43 years) were eligible. Blasts in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) were both more than 30%, bcr/abl fusion genes were detected positive in 90% cells by analysis of karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Five patients showed t(9;22) and other 15 patients showed more complicated chromosome abnormality. Of these 20 patients, 17 patients developed Ph(+)-ANLL from CML, 1 case developed Ph(+)-ALL, and other 2 cases were primary Ph(+)-ALL. The median interval from diagnosis to Glivec treatment was 4 months. Eighteen of 20 patients received different chemotherapy regimens for 2-4 treatment cycles, but no one reached hematological complete remission (HCR). All patients were given oral Glivec daily at the doses of 0.3-0.6 g in a median treatment time of 2.5 months (range, 1-6.5 months). Ph(+)-ANLL patients were infused with HHT over 6-24 hours daily at the doses of 1-2 mg intravenously and Ara-C 30-50 mg daily subcutaneously for 10-14 days; 3 patients with Ph(+)-ALL received HOAP or DOP combination treatment regimens (One cycle consists of HA with the same dosage described above for Ph(+)-ANLL patients for 7 days, daunorubicin at the dose of 40 mg/d intravenously for 3 days, vincristine at the dose of 2 mg/wk for two weeks, and prednisone at the doses of 60-80 mg/d for 14 days). Median treatment cycle was 2 (range, 1-3). The dosage of Glivec could be reduced or treatment was suspended when bone marrow inhibition happened. G-CSF was used when necessary. The curative effect was evaluated by international hematology and cytogenetics standards, in which bone marrow was examined every chemotherapy cycle and chromosome was analyzed 3 months later. RESULTS: Among the 20 patients receiving Glivec, 40% achieved HCR, and 25% achieved hematological partial remission (HPR), but only 15% patients approached a partial cytogenetic remission and no cytogenetic responses were found in other 85% patients. White blood cells (WBC) in peripheral blood reduced from 41+/-31 x 10(9)/L to normal level within 1 week. The blasts decreased from (50+/-30)% to(1.9+/-2.9)% (P< 0.001) in median time of 21.0+/-16.8 days. Three patients with high fever recovered normal temperature after 3 days treatment.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of sodium butyrate (NaB) on LRP expression level and the function of LRP in K562 cells. METHODS: Human myeloid leukemia K562 cells, used as an in vitro model, were treated with NaB. The LRP mRNA expression and protein levels in the cells before and after NaB treatment were detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry indirect immunofluorescence method,respectively. Intracellular Adriamycin(ADM) location and intracellular daunorubicin(DNR) accumulation were detected by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with untreated K562 cells, the LRP mRNA level in the cells treated with 2 mmol/L NaB was increased obviously; the protein expression were turned from negative result to positive result and the ratios of positive cells were increased from 1.68% to 35.81%. Intracellular DNR accumulation was decreased in the treated K562 cells and the mean fluorescence of DNR reduced 68.64% compared with the untreated K562 cells. There was strong ADM fluorescence in the nuclei of untreated K562 cells; while the treated K562 cells showed significantly less ADM fluorescence in their nuclei but more fluorescence in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: Both the mRNA level and the protein expression of LRP in K562 cells can be increased by NaB induction. LRP induced by NaB is involved in the decreasing anti-cancer drug accumulation and transporting the drugs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in K562 cells.","['Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, The First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, PR China. ningli_cn@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this paper was designed to investigate whether P.B could inhibit cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. METHODS: Morphological changes of cell nuclei were observed under invert fluorescence microscope and transmission electron microscope. The changes in the cell size distribution were analyzed by Coulter Multisizer II particle analyzer. DNA ladder and apoptotic cells were analyzed respectively by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The K562 cells treated with 10 micromol/L P.B for 24 hours showed morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells, such as decrease in cellular volume, nuclear chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and plasma membrane bleb formation. The treatment of K562 cells with 10 micromol/L P.B for 6, 12,and 24 hours caused the increase of the detected DNA ladder and the decrease of normal size cells both in a time-dependent manner. The percentage of apoptotic bodies detected in the sub-G(0)/G(1) peak region by flow cytometry was also increased time-dependently as analyzed as 6.12% for 6 hours, 35.6% for 12 hours and 45.7% for 24 hours treatments, respectively.

Transcription of 97% of cellular genes, including 300 other transcription factor genes (21 Hox genes) and other myeloid genes, varied less than 3-fold, with most varying less than 50%. Therefore, E2a-Pbx1 prevents transcription and maintains the cell cycle by a specific rather than a global transcriptional mechanism. Monocyte progenitors were distinguished by persistent expression of IRF8 and of a category of other genes characterized as ""interferon-stimulated"" (ISG15, ISG20, Ifit1, Ifi202a, Ifi203, IfiS204, Ifi204-related, IRF7 and Ly6-E.1), as well as by the upregulation of the Lrg21 bZip transcription factor gene during late differentiation. The synchronous expression of stage-specific and cell cycle genes regulated by E2a-Pbx1 in these cell lines comprises a model system in which analysis of their promoters can be used as a starting point to backtrack to the transcriptional mechanisms of oncogenesis by E2a-Pbx1.","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0612, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the biochemical basis of their mature cell functions, their differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors, and the mechanisms by which myeloid leukemia oncogenes block their differentiation programs, continue to be areas of active research. Four major problems limit progress in these fields. First, the biochemical analysis of mature cells is limited by the time and cost of purifying neutrophils, monocytes, or dendritic cells from wild-type and genetically modified mouse strains. Second, while immortal myeloid cell lines are used to understand the transcriptional basis of normal terminal differentiation following their treatment with differentiationpromoting agents (e.g. G-CSF, IL-6, RA, TPA), these cells contain stable defects responsible for their immortalization, and the degree to which they model normal differentiation is often incomplete. Third, these same inducible cell lines are used as model systems to determine how myeloid oncoproteins prevent differentiation; however, oncoproteins that block differentiation of marrow progenitors cultured in GM-CSF or IL-3 but permit their differentiation in response to G-CSF or RA, do not score effectively in these assays (e.g. Hoxa9, Mll-Enl). Fourth, there is no reproducible method to derive myeloid progenitor lines that execute predictable terminal differentiation to neutrophils, monocytes, or dendritic cells. Developing this type of system is needed to evaluate how myeloid gene inactivation by knockout technologies alters lineage-specific differentiation and mature cell function. Conditional myeloid oncoproteins provide a tool to solve these research problems by providing a predictable and inexpensive means of expanding, in culture, GM-CSF- or IL-3-dependent myeloid progenitors from any genotype, and by permitting their synchronous differentiation to neutrophils, monocytes, or dendritic cells under defined culture conditions following inactivation of the conditional oncoprotein. This system of conditionally immortalizing normal bone marrow precursors provides the large numbers of normal cells required for analysis of cell biology and protein biochemistry, and further provides a model system in which to study the genetic mechanisms controlling terminal differentiation and how specific oncoproteins expressed in the cell lines prevent this differentiation program. The ability to derive conditionally-immortalized progenitor lines from knock-out mice provides cell lines for the reconstitution of knockout gene function and subsequent dissection of knockout protein function by mutational analysis. Finally, conditional myeloid cell lines can be established from both ES cells and from d10 fetal liver cells, allowing for the analysis of embryonic lethal mutants on both the maturation and terminal differentiation of mature myeloid cells. In this review,we summarize the importance and limitations of current approaches in myeloid cell research, and how estrogen-regulated conditional oncoproteins help to solve these problems.","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",,58,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for CML. Much of its therapeutic efficacy is attributed to a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect exerted by donor-derived lymphoid cells against the Ph positive (Ph+) clone. Post-HSCT monitoring by cytogenetic and molecular detection of the Ph+ clone is necessary, so that pre-emptive immunologic or pharmacologic treatment may be administered at an early stage of relapse. However, under rare circumstances a second Ph negative (Ph-) leukemia may evolve post-HSCT. The pathogenetic possibilities included leukemia arising from donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), or transformation of residual recipient-derived Ph- HSCs that have survived the conditioning chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recipient-derived Ph- leukemia may be related to genetic alterations that precede the onset of CML, or myelotoxic effects of the HSCT conditioning regimen. The diagnosis of Ph- relapses requires detailed investigations by conventional karyotyping, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular analysis; as well as chimerism studies that help to document the donor or recipient origin of the leukemia. Although uncommonly reported in the past, Ph- relapses may in fact be more frequent if leukemic relapses post-HSCT are more thoroughly evaluated with these investigations. The recognition of Ph- relapses are important in several ways. Ph- relapses cannot be identified by monitoring investigations targeting the Ph+ clone, so that the early detection of Ph- leukemia is usually not possible. Furthermore, Ph- relapses will not respond to therapeutic strategies effective against the Ph+ CML clone.","[""University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",,70,,,,,,,,,,,

The NA in routine clinical use include the pyrimidine analog cytosine arabinoside (ara-c), which is extensively used in the treatment of acute leukemias, and the purine analogs, cladribine and fludarabine. These drugs have mostly been used in the treatment of low grade hematological malignancies. NA become therapeutically effective only after phosporylation to the triphosphate level. The 5'-nucleotidases (5'-NTs) dephosphorylate the monophosphate form of NA and, therefore, may affect the pharmacological activity of these antimetabolites in the clinic. Several 5'-NTs attached to membranes or present in the cytosol or in mitochondria are present in mammalian cells. cN-II, an IMP-selective 5'-NT, participates in the regulation of purine deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. cN-II opposes the action of the salvage enzymes by dephosphorylating purine nucleoside mononphosphates to purine nucleosides. Due to its phosphotransferase activity, cN-II can also phosphorylate inosine and 2',3'-dideoxyribonucleosides utilizing IMP as a phosphate donor. The observation that cytosolic cN-II is able to phosphorylate purine nucleosides has initiated studies on its potential participation in the metabolism of anticancer agents and in the development of cN-II inhibitory substances. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge concerning cN-II activity and regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotide pools and it role in hematological malignancies.","['Unite INSERM 453, 69373 Lyon Cedex 08, France.']",,61,,,,,,,,,,,

In human endometrium, only the GLUT1 and GLUT3 isoforms are expressed, whereas glucose transporters, involved in insulin-dependent glucose uptake (GLUT2, GLUT4, GLUT8), could not be detected. Messenger RNA expression, analyzed by RNase protection assay, of both isoforms increased in total endometrium throughout the secretory phase and in decidua. Analysis of mRNA expression in isolated epithelial cells, stromal cells, and CD45 positive leukocytes revealed that increase of GLUT1 expression was due to increasing stromal expression, whereas increase of GLUT3 was due to its expression in CD45-positive immune cells. In vitro, GLUT1 and GLUT3 were not directly regulated by 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, or IL-1beta, IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor, but GLUT1 mRNA increased progressively in stromal cells, decidualized in vitro. Inhibition of glucose transporters by cytochalasin B reduced stromal glucose uptake and stromal decidualization. In idiopathic infertile patients, GLUT1 expression in midsecretory endometrium was suppressed. The suppression was caused by reduced stromal expression. Our results suggest stromal GLUT to play a role in the regulation of endometrial function and be compromised in the preparation of the endometrium for the implanting embryo.","['Department of Gynecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, University of Heidelberg, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany. michael.von.wolff@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia is caused by MTX and is responsible for its neurotoxic effects. The purposes of this study were to explore whether hyperhomocysteinemia was related to MTX administration and toxicity and whether homocysteine or MTX toxicity differed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or reduced folate carrier (RFC) genetic polymorphisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 53 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were consecutively treated on a single clinical protocol that included two courses of high-dose MTX (high-dose methotrexate [HDMTX]; 2.5 or 5.0 g/m2 per day) as consolidation therapy. RESULTS: The study participants' median plasma homocysteine concentrations at 23 and 44 hours after HDMTX (9.00 micromol/L and 10.12 micromol/L, respectively) were greater than the concentrations immediately before HDMTX (5.77 micromol/L, P <.0001 for both comparisons). Seven days after HDMTX treatment, their plasma concentration returned to baseline. Nine patients experienced seizures, and five patients experienced thrombosis during the first 15 months of therapy, with a tendency for there to be higher plasma homocysteine in patients with seizures across all time points (P =.063) but not in patients with thrombosis (P =.59). We observed no significant differences in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine levels or in toxicity based on the MTHFR 677C/T or RFC 80G/A genotypes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that homocysteine was transiently elevated after HDMTX and may be related to seizure risk in children with leukemia.","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM 61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM 61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We undertook this analysis to more accurately define the estimate of risk of secondary acute leukemia (sAL) following epirubicin-containing chemotherapy regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the conditional probability of sAL among 1,545 women who received adjuvant (n = 1,477) or neoadjuvant (n = 68) chemotherapy in four National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group trials from 1990 to 1999. The risks associated with epirubicin-containing regimens (CEF or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide [EC]) and other regimens (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC] or CMF) were determined. RESULTS: A total of 10 cases of sAL were observed (eight acute myelogeneous leukemia, two acute lymphoblastic leukemia): seven among women treated with CEF, two who had received AC, and one following CMF. Using competing risk statistics, the conditional probability of sAL was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 3.6) among 539 women treated with CEF chemotherapy at a follow-up of 8 years, 0.4% (95% CI, 0% to 1.3%) among the 678 who received CMF, and 1.3% (95% CI, 0% to 4.7%) among the 231 treated with AC. The conditional probability of death from breast cancer at 8 years for the entire group of women treated with epirubicin-containing regimens in all four trials was approximately 34.9%. CONCLUSION: CEF chemotherapy for breast cancer carries a small increased risk of sAL compared with CMF. These estimates of acute leukemia risk are important in discussing treatment with women, especially patients with a lower risk of death from breast cancer, such as those with node-negative breast cancer.","['Princess Margaret Hospital, 610 University Ave, Room 5-108, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9. michael.crump@uhn.on.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (median age, 54 years; range, 37 to 66 years) underwent RI-HSCT using a conditioning regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 daily for 5 days and either cyclophosphamide 1 g/m2 daily for 2 days (14 patients) or melphalan 140 mg/m2 for 1 day (two patients). The median number of CD34+ cells and CD3+ cells infused per kilogram of recipient weight was 4.5 x 106 (range, 1.8 to 7.3 x 106 cells) and 2.9 x 108 (range, 0.1 to 9.6 x 108 cells), respectively. RESULTS: There was no transplant-related mortality (TRM) within 100 days of HSCT. Grade 1 to 2 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in three patients, but neither grade 3 nor grade 4 disease was observed. Chronic GVHD occurred in 10 patients. One patient had cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation but did not develop CMV disease. With a median follow-up of 26 months (range, 15 to 45 months), 11 patients are alive (nine in continuous complete remission and one in complete remission after a second transplantation), and five have died (four from disease progression and one from bone-marrow aplasia induced by cyclosporine withdrawal). The 2-year actuarial overall and event-free survival rates were 69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40% to 86%) and 56% (95% CI, 30% to 68%), respectively. CONCLUSION: This strategy of RI-HSCT resulted in reliable engraftment with low incidence of acute GVHD and TRM.

In the lentiviral vector genome context, the RBS repressed expression of a modified MLV long terminal repeat (MNDU3) promoter, a simian virus 40 promoter, and three cellular promoters: ubiquitin C, mPGK, and hEF-1a. In addition to repressing expression in undifferentiated ES and EC cell lines, we show that the RBS substantially repressed expression in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells, whole mouse bone marrow and its differentiated progeny after bone marrow transplant, and several mouse hematopoietic cell lines. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we show that binding factor A, the trans-acting factor proposed to convey repression by its interaction with the RBS, is present in the nuclear extracts of all mouse cells we analyzed where expression was repressed by the RBS. In addition, we show that the RBS partially repressed expression in the human hematopoietic cell line DU.528 and primary human CD34(+) CD38(-) hematopoietic cells isolated from umbilical cord blood. These findings suggest that retroviral vectors carrying the RBS are subjected to high rates of repression in murine and human cells and that MLV vectors with primer binding site substitutions that remove the RBS may yield more-effective gene expression.","[""Division of Research Immunology/BMT, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.""]",,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P01 CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

As predicted, mutagenesis of conserved basic residues as well as residues of the zinc finger domains in the BLV NC domain of PrGag revealed residues that led to a reduction in viral RNA packaging. Interestingly, when conserved basic residues in the BLV MA domain of PrGag were mutated to alanine or glycine, but not when mutated to another basic residue, reductions in viral RNA packaging were also observed. The ability of PrGag to be targeted to the cell membrane was not affected by these mutations in MA, indicating that PrGag membrane targeting was not associated with the reduction in RNA packaging. These observations indicate that these basic residues in the MA domain of PrGag influence RNA packaging, without influencing Gag membrane localization. It was further observed that (i) a MA/NC double mutant had a more severe RNA packaging defect than either mutant alone, and (ii) RNA packaging was not found to be associated with transient localization of Gag in the nucleus. In summary, this report provides the first direct evidence for the involvement of both the BLV MA and NC domains of PrGag in viral RNA packaging.","['Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Graduate Program, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These lymphomas result from proviral integrations into the oncogene c-myb. In contrast, LR-9, which lacks the 42-nucleotide gag gene deletion of DeltaLR-9, does not cause a high frequency of c-myb-associated short-latency lymphomas. Although viral replication rates and spliced env mRNA levels were found to be similar for both viruses, DeltaLR-9 exhibited an increase in readthrough transcription compared to LR-9. The DeltaLR-9 deletion is located in the region of the gag gene corresponding to the matrix (MA) protein as well as in the negative regulator of splicing (NRS) element. To test whether disruption of the NRS or of the MA protein was responsible for inducing short-latency lymphomas, we generated viruses with NRS point mutations that maintained the wild-type Gag amino acid sequence. One of the mutant viruses induced an even higher incidence than DeltaLR-9 of short-latency lymphomas with viral integrations into c-myb. Thus, we propose that disruption of the NRS sequence promotes readthrough transcription and splicing to the downstream myb gene, causing overexpression of a slightly truncated Myb protein, which induces short-latency tumors.","['Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, USA.']",,,"['T32 GM007231/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA48746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA20068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM07231/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA048746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA020068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

For viruses in general, apoptotic death of infected cells is a mechanism for reducing virus replication. Apoptosis can also be an important factor in augmenting antigen presentation and the host immune response. We examined apoptosis in response to RSV infection of primary small airway cells, primary tracheal-bronchial cells, and A549 and HEp-2 cell lines. The primary cells and the A549 cell line gave generally similar responses, indicating their appropriateness as models in contrast to HEp-2 cells. With the use of RNase protection assays with probes representing 33 common apoptosis factors, we found strong transcriptional activation of both pro- and antiapoptotic factors in response to RSV infection, which were further studied at the protein level and by functional assays. In particular, RSV infection strongly up-regulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its functional receptors death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5. Furthermore, RSV-infected cells became highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by exogenous TRAIL. These findings suggest that RSV-infected cells in vivo are susceptible to killing through the TRAIL pathway by immune cells such as natural killer and CD4(+) cells that bear membrane-bound TRAIL. RSV infection also induced several proapoptotic factors of the Bcl-2 family and caspases 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, representing both the death receptor- and mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathways. RSV also mediated the strong induction of antiapoptotic factors of the Bcl-2 family, especially Mcl-1, which might account for the delayed induction of apoptosis in RSV-infected cells in the absence of exogenous induction of the TRAIL pathway.","['Respiratory Viruses Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hypothesis proposes that nonimmune children exposed to some unknown infection(s), through population mixing, are at increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study registered 3,838 children with cancer and 7,669 matched controls aged 0-14 years during 1991-1996 in England, Scotland, and Wales. Local area characteristics for each child's residential address at diagnosis were assigned from census data: volume and diversity of population mixing, material deprivation, and rural status. The best-fitting models were chosen for three diagnostic groups: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and all other tumors. Elevated risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were found in areas with a low diversity of origins of migrants and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in areas with a low diversity of origins of child migrants; for other tumors, no covariates were associated. This study, and a survey of 17 published reports on population mixing, suggests that a low diversity of migrant backgrounds may be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro studies were performed in the AY-27 rat transitional cell cancer and the L1210 mouse leukemia cell lines. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of EGCG for 30 minutes to 48 hours. Surviving cell colonies were then determined. A DNA ladder assay was performed in the 2 cell lines. Fisher 344 rats were used for in vivo studies with an intravesical tumor implantation model. Group 1 (12 rats) served as a control (tumor implantation and medium wash only). In group 2 (28 rats) 200 microM EGCG were instilled intravesically 30 minutes after tumor implantation. Rats were sacrificed 3 weeks following treatment. Gross and histological analyses were then performed on the bladders. RESULTS: At 6.0 x 104 cells per 100 mm dish a time dose dependent response was observed. After 2 hours of treatment with EGCG 100% cell lethality of the AY-27 cell line occurred at concentrations greater than 100 microM. Strong banding on the DNA ladder assay was seen with the L1210 mouse leukemia cell line. Only weak banding patterns were found in the AY-27 cell line treated with EGCG (100 and 200 microM) for 24 hours. All 12 controls were successfully implanted with tumors. In group 2 (EGCG instillation) 18 of the 28 animals (64%) were free of tumor (Fisher's exact test p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The clonal assays showed a time dose related response to EGCG. Intravesical instillation of EGCG inhibits the growth of AY-27 rat transitional cells implanted in this model.,"['Department of Urology, Medical College of Ohio, 3065 Arlington Avenue, Dowling Hall 2170, Toledo, OH 43614-5807, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After ligand binding, Notch receptors are cleaved to release their intracellular domains. The intracellular domains, the activated form of Notch receptors, are then translocated into the nucleus where they interact with other transcriptional machinery to regulate the expression of cellular genes. To dissect the molecular mechanisms of Notch signaling, the cellular targets that interact with Notch1 receptor intracellular domain (N1IC) were screened. In this study, we found that endogenous transcription factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1) was associated with exogenous N1IC in human K562 erythroleukemic cells. The ankyrin (ANK) domain of N1IC and zinc finger domains of YY1 were essential for the association of N1IC and YY1 according to the pull-down assay of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Furthermore, both YY1 and N1IC were present in a large complex of the nucleus to suppress the luciferase reporter activity transactivated by Notch signaling. The transcription factor YY1 indirectly regulated the transcriptional activity of the wild-type CBF1-response elements via the direct interaction of N1IC and CBF1. We also demonstrated the association between endogenous N1IC and intrinsic YY1 in human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that transcription factor YY1 may modulate Notch signaling via association with the high molecular weight Notch complex.","['Graduate Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, Center for Stem Cells Research at Wan-Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan. cmbtsyeh@tmu.edu.tw']",,,,,20030811,,,,,,,,

Because leukemia cell burden is reduced but not eradicated by polychemotherapy, improved treatment strategies should enhance those immune mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of complete remission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protection of mice challenged with the syngeneic Ph(+) ALL cell line BM185 using genetically modified leukemia cell vaccines and immunomodulating oligonucleotides. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because retroviral vectors are ineffective at transducing nondividing primary cells from human hematopoietic malignancies, we first evaluated nonviral techniques (electroporation and ballistic transfer) using minimalistic immunogenically defined gene expression vectors to generate B7.1 or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing BM185 cells. Subsequently, protective vaccination experiments with these cells were performed in a leukemia challenge mouse model. RESULTS: Electroporation yielded a high transfection rate (82.6% for B7.1) with moderate GM-CSF secretion/1 x 10(6) cells (228 pg), whereas ballistic transfer led to a lower transfection rate (30.9%) with high GM-CSF secretion (614 pg). Secondly, we immunized mice with B7.1/interleukin 2- or B7.1/GM-CSF-expressing BM185 cell vaccines. We observed a better protection of mice that received the B7.1/GM-CSF vaccine compared with these receiving the B7.1/interleukin 2 vaccine. Protection was additionally enhanced by application of a double stem-loop immunomodulating oligonucleotide containing CpG motifs. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that immunization with B7.1/GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccines generated by electroporation and application of double stem-loop immunomodulating oligonucleotide protected mice against a murine Ph(+) ALL challenge. Ultimately, this approach may also lead to clinical benefit in patients with Ph(+) ALL.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Children's Hospital, University of Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the efficacy of low-dose 5-aza-2'-deoxycitydine (DAC), a methylation inhibitor, with interleukin (IL) 12, one of the most potent cytokines with antitumor activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mice inoculated with L1210 leukemia cells or with B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with 7 daily injections of low-dose DAC (0.2 mg/kg) and/or 7 daily doses of IL-12 (100 ng/dose). Scid/scid mice as well as monoclonal antibodies against CD4, CD8, and NK1.1 were used to investigate the mechanisms of the antitumor effects of the combination treatment. The activity of murine lymphocytes was measured with enzyme-linked immunospot and (51)Cr release assays. RESULTS: Treatment with DAC or IL-12 given alone produced moderate antitumor effects. In both tumor models combined treatment resulted in potentiated antitumor effects and produced 70% long-term survivors among mice inoculated with L1210 cells. The antitumor efficacy of combined treatment was abrogated in scid/scid mice, and after depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Mice inoculated with B16F10 melanoma cells had significantly delayed tumor growth after combined treatment with DAC and IL-12. Strong antitumor effect correlated with a significant activation of lymph node-derived CD8(+) and CD4(+) cells. Transient neutropenia was observed in mice under treatment of DAC alone, but remarkably this effect was not potentiated by IL-12. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that antitumor effects of DAC can be strongly potentiated by IL-12 and could be beneficial in an effective low-dose-based antitumor therapy.","['Department of Immunology, Center of Biostructure, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-004 Warsaw, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also determined the extent of microsatellite instability (MSI) in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) as a marker of dysfunctional DNA mismatch repair. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a novel restriction fragment length polymorphism, verified by direct sequencing, we have genotyped 91 t-AML cases, 420 de novo acute myeloid leukemia cases, and 837 controls for the hMSH2 -6 exon 13 polymorphism. MSI was evaluated in presentation bone marrow from 34 cases using the mononucleotide microsatellite markers BAT16, BAT25, and BAT26. RESULTS: Distribution of the hMSH2 -6 exon 13 polymorphism was not significantly different between de novo acute myeloid leukemia cases and controls, with heterozygotes and homozygotes for the variant (C) allele representing 12.2 and 1.6%, respectively, of the control population. However, the variant (C) hMSH2 allele was significantly overrepresented in t-AML cases that had previously been treated with O(6)-guanine alkylating agents, including cyclophosphamide and procarbazine, compared with controls (odds ratio, 4.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-11.37). Thirteen of 34 (38%) t-AML cases were MSI positive, and 2 of these 13 cases were homozygous for the variant (C) allele, a frequency substantially higher than in the control population. CONCLUSIONS: Association of the hMSH2 -6 exon 13 variant (C) allele with leukemia after O(6)-guanine alkylating agents implicates this allele in conferring a nondisabling DNA mismatch repair defect with concomitant moderate alkylation tolerance, which predisposes to the development of t-AML via the induction of DNA mismatch repair-disabling mutations and high-grade MSI. Homozygosity for the hMSH2 variant in 2 of 13 MSI-positive t-AML cases provides some support for this model.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, Academic Unit of Epidemiology, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determination of these factors is crucial for adapting post remission therapy in adult ALL. Indeed, risk-adapted strategies based on those biologic and clinical features are currently being applied to improve survival. In this review, we report the different prognostic factors described in adult ALL and discuss the controversies in current adult ALL management in relation with these different features. The data reported are derived from the medical literature and from the experience of the authors. Prognostic factors appear to be time-dependent. This emphasizes their determination according to the phase of treatment. The use of time-segmented multivariate analysis able to distinguish prognostic factors associated with the induction phase and those associated with the post-induction phase of treatment seems suitable to define accurately prognostic models.","[""Service d'Hematologie, Clinique Hopital Edouard Herriot, 69437 Lyon cedex 03, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",,81,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, LAA-treated HL-60 showed activity to produce chemiluminescence and expressed CD 66b cell surface antigens, indicating that LAA induces the differentiation of HL-60 mainly into granulocytes. The results are supported by morphological changes of LAA-treated HL-60 into segmented neutrophils. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of LAA on the growth of HL-60 cells seems to arise from the induction of differentiation. To assess the potential role of LAA, cells were exposed to oxygen radical scavengers in the absence or presence of LAA. Catalase abolished and superoxide dismutase promoted LAA-induced differentiation of HL-60. Thus, H2O2 produced as a result of LAA treatment seems to play a major role in induction of HL-60 differentiation.","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Cheju National University, Ara 1-dong, Jeju 690-756, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors conducted a Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab in advanced or refractory chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. The most common diagnoses were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 42 patients) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 18 patients). Before entering the study, the patients had received multiple therapies (median, three therapies) and the median time from diagnosis was 7 years. Alemtuzumab was given intravenously at doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on 3 consecutive days, after which 30 mg was administered 3 times a week. Patients were treated for 4-12 weeks depending on disease response. All patients received prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and valacyclovir. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 35%, the complete response (CR) rate was 13%, and the partial response (PR) rate was 22%. The median duration of response was 18 months for patients achieving a CR and 7 months for patients achieving a PR. The median duration of survival was 25 months for patients who had a response and 12 months for the entire population. Normalization of the lymphocyte count was observed in 84% of patients and resolution of bone marrow involvement was observed in 49% of patients. The most common infusion-related adverse events were fever, rigors, skin rash, nausea, and dyspnea. These were most common during the first week of therapy. Hematologic toxicity was comprised of long-lasting lymphocytopenia and transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Thirty-six patients (46%) experienced at least one episode of fever or infection.

Highly potent and selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinases are being investigated as alternatives to standard chemotherapy. One such inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, is being used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Ovarian carcinomas frequently develop resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemical expression of c-ABL, PDGFR-beta, and c-KIT was evaluated in ovarian carcinomas to determine whether treatment with imatinib mesylate might be feasible. METHODS: The expression of c-ABL, c-KIT, and PDGFR-beta in tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of 52 ovarian serous carcinomas, including 21 low-grade (well differentiated) and 31 high-grade (poorly differentiated) tumors. Fourteen normal ovaries were also evaluated. RESULTS: In normal ovarian surface epithelium, c-ABL was expressed universally. PDGFR-beta was expressed in the majority (93%) of samples of normal ovarian epithelium, whereas the c-KIT protein was undetectable in normal ovarian surface epithelium. Overall, c-ABL was expressed in 71% of serous carcinomas. c-ABL was expressed more frequently in the low-grade serous carcinomas (81%) compared with the high-grade serous carcinomas (65%). PDGFR-beta expression was observed in 81% of serous carcinomas overall and was observed more frequently in higher-grade tumors. c-KIT immunohistochemical staining was absent in low-grade tumors but was present in 26% of high-grade serous carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of ovarian serous carcinomas express one or more of the kinases targeted by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, suggesting the potential usefulness of this drug in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma.","['Department of Gynecologic Oncology, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: Survivors were interviewed by telephone using the following standardized measures: Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), PostTraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist with the trauma defined as survivors' response to having had cancer (PCL-C), Conditioned Nausea, Vomiting and Distress, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (quality of life), Life Experience Survey (stressful events), MOS Social Support Survey, comorbid conditions (Older Americans Resources and Services Questionnaire), and items developed to assess long-term breast carcinoma treatment side effects and their interference with functioning. RESULTS: Only 5% of survivors had scores that were suggestive of clinical levels of distress (BSI), 15% reported 2 or more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PCL-C) that were moderately to extremely bothersome, 1-6% reported conditioned nausea, emesis, and distress as a consequence of sights, smells, and tastes triggered by reminders of their treatment, 29% reported sexual problems attributed to having had cancer, 39% reported lymphedema, and 33%, reported numbness. Survivors who reported greater lymphedema and numbness that interfered with functioning had significantly worse PTSD (PCL-C; P = 0.008) com- pared with survivors who reported less lymphedema and numbness. Survivors with a lower level of education (P = 0.026), less adequate social support (P = 0.0033), more severe negative life events (P = 0.0098), and greater dissatisfaction with their medical care (P = 0.037) had worse PTSD compared with other survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty years after the initial treatment, the impact of breast carcinoma on survivors' adjustment was minimal. However, the higher prevalence of PTSD symptoms in response to having had cancer is indicative of continuing psychologic sequelae long after treatment completion. Findings related to lymphedema and numbness and continued symptoms of PTSD suggest that the long-term psychologic and medical sequelae on adjustment may be underrecognized.

In cell lines with properties of AML M6/M7 (K562 and CMK), differentiation towards megakaryopoietic and erythropoietic phenotypes can be induced in vitro. Transitory myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) is a self-limited disorder of newborn infants with Down syndrome, phenotypically resembling acute myeloid leukemia of megakaryoblastic lineage. Despite spontaneous disappearance of blasts from blood and bone marrow, in about 10% of the patients, overt acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML M7) develops up to 4 years later. Recently, mutations of the GATA1 transcription factor have been identified in the megakaryoblastic leukemia of Down syndrome. Here, we studied cells from a patient suffering from megakaryoblastic AML at the age of 2.5 years after spontaneous remission of neonatal TMD. In vitro, terminal differentiation towards a megakaryocyte-like phenotype could be induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), with typical morphological features, upregulation of platelet-specific and downregulation of erythroid antigens, going along with downregulation of c-myc. Whether spontaneous resolution of TMD is a process due to terminal differentiation is still open; however, here we give evidence that in vitro differentiation can be induced even in blasts deriving from an overt AML French-American-British (FAB) M7 after TMD.","[""University Children's Hospital Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 43, 89070, Ulm, Germany. carl.classen@medizin.uni-ulm.de."", 'First Clinic for Children and Adolescents, Klinikum Augsburg, Stenglinstrasse 2, 86156, Augsburg, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 43, 89070, Ulm, Germany.""]",,,,,20030621,,,,,,10.1007/s00277-003-0692-3 [doi],,

The main goal was to reduce the substantial treatment-related mortality in this patient population while preserving the potential curative graft-versus-leukemia effect. This review summarizes results of published trials using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelofibrosis. In most of the published trials conditioning contained fludarabine (90-180 mg/m(2)) in combination with busulfan (4 x 10 mg/kg), melphalan (90-140 mg/m(2)), or 2-5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells from related or unrelated donors were used as graft source in most of the studies. Post-transplantation immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine combined with methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Although the majority of the patients were above the age of 50 years, early treatment-related mortality was rather low. Nevertheless, the rate of clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) seemed to be comparable to conventional transplants in most of the protocols. The outcome differed between trials, but diagnosis and disease status pre-transplant significantly influenced outcome. In summary, this approach is feasible and provides access to the curative potential of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with higher age or comorbidities. Since the majority of the reports included heterogeneous patient populations, mostly with a short follow-up, more and specifically randomized studies are needed to define the role of RIC before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Hamatologische Abteilung, AK St. Georg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany. bornhaeuser@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de.']",,32,,,20030621,,,,,,10.1007/s00277-003-0680-7 [doi],,

Prior to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HDCT), 11 patients underwent cytoreduction with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Flu/Cy); 11 were in complete remission (CR) and one was in partial remission at the time of HDCT.

High-level gene expression is desirable for several gene therapy approaches involving T lymphocytes. We evaluated standard retroviral vectors with cis-regulatory control elements of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) with or without the human T cell-specific CD2 enhancer. For comparison, vectors containing the long terminal repeat (LTR) of myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) and an improved 5' untranslated region were used (MP71 vectors), with or without the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (PRE). All vectors expressed the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) to measure transgene expression. In mouse T cells MP71 vectors with and without the PRE yielded an up to 10-fold higher expression level compared with the Mo-MLV-based vectors currently used for gene transfer into T lymphocytes. A high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of standard Mo-MLV vectors could not reach expression levels obtained with a low MOI of MP71 vector. Ex vivo-transduced mouse T lymphocytes maintained the vector-dependent differences in level of transgene expression in Rag-1-deficient mice when adoptively transferred. In four human T cell lines and human primary T lymphocytes MP71 vectors yielded an up to 75-fold higher GFP expression level in comparison with the standard Mo-MLV vector. In contrast to mouse T cells, the integration of the PRE into MP71 vectors induced in human T cells a further significant increase in transgene expression level. Southern blot analysis of CEM T cells revealed that the superior performance of MP71 vectors was not due to a higher rate of viral integration. In summary, MP71 vectors are useful tools for stable, high-level gene expression in T lymphocytes, for example, in the expression of T cell receptor genes.","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rossle-Strasse 10, 13092 Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cultures of murine origin, transgene expression was observed solely in the sensory neurons with the stromal cell population failing to show evidence of transduction. In contrast, efficient and sustained transduction of both sensory neurons and the stromal cell population was observed in cultures of human origin. Given the widespread use of murine models in preclinical gene therapy studies, in the current study we investigated the basis of this apparent neuron specificity of lentivirus-mediated transduction in murine DRG cultures. The interspecies differences persisted at high multiplicities of infection, and irrespective of whether lentiviral vector stocks were packaged in the presence or absence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory proteins. Cell-type specificity of CMV promoter expression, tropism of the VSV-G envelope, and blocks to molecular transduction were also precluded as possible mechanisms, thereby implicating transcriptional repression of the internal heterologous promoter. This promoter interference effect was found to be mediated by cis-acting sequences upstream of the core promoter elements located in the U3 region of the proviral long terminal repeats (LTRs).

To date, PDGF expression has been demonstrated in a number of different solid tumors, from glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these various tumor types, the biologic role of PDGF signaling can vary from autocrine stimulation of cancer cell growth to subtler paracrine interactions involving adjacent stroma and vasculature. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571, Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) blocks activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, and as such was recently approved for several indications in the treatment on chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In both of these examples the target protein was identified by an oncogenic, activating mutation. Imatinib mesylate is also a potent inhibitor of PDGFR kinase and is currently being evaluated for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, based upon evidence in these diseases of activating mutations in PDGFR. However, the PDGF pathway may represent a therapeutic target in other solid tumors in which it is not part of the oncogenic transformation. In order to investigate the potential biologic implications of inhibiting PDGFR in these tumor types, clinical trials that investigate both established clinical endpoints of response and benefit, as well as surrogate endpoints that describe the biologic significance of PDGF inhibition in vivo are needed.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",,33,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we review the functions, signaling activities, mechanism of transformation, and therapeutic targeting of two prototypic tyrosine kinase oncogenes, BCR-ABL and FLT3, associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. BCR-ABL is generated by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a chimeric oncogene in which the BCR and c-ABL genes are fused. The product of this oncogene, BCR-ABL, has elevated ABL tyrosine kinase activity and transforms hematopoietic cells by exerting a wide variety of biological effects, including reduction in growth factor dependence, enhanced viability, and altered adhesion of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) cells. Elevated tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is critical for activating downstream signalling cascades and for all aspects of transformation, explaining the remarkable clinical efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (STI571). By comparison, FLT3 is mutated in about one third of all cases of AML, most often through a mechanism that involves an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of a small number of amino acid residues in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. As is the case for BCR-ABL, these mutations activate the kinase activity constitutively, activate multiple signaling pathways, and result in an augmentation of proliferation and viability. Transformation by FLT3-ITD can readily be observed in murine models, and FLT3 cooperates with other types of oncogenes to create a fully transformed acute leukemia. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and may be very useful therapeutic agents in AML.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,166,,,,,,,,,,,

This model consists of two phases: an induction phase of eight months, in which newly-diagnosed patients are treated with either IFN or imatinib, and a chronic treatment phase wherein patients are treated according the result of the induction phase. The model calculated the costs and effects of the treatment. Input for this model was derived from literature and expert opinion. Costs were based on real cost prices and tariffs. RESULTS: Treatment with imatinib resulted in 6.67 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and treatment with IFN resulted in 4.98 QALYs.

All of the fusion genes reported to date in Ewing's tumors juxtapose the EWS gene at 22q12 to an ETS-related gene, the most common of which are FLI1 at 11q24 and ERG at 21q22. We present here four cases of Ewing's tumor, which showed no evidence of a EWS gene rearrangement, but instead contained translocations involving 16p11 and 21q22. A rearrangement involving the same chromosome bands, t(16;21)(p11;q22), is found in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia and fuses the FUS gene at 16p11 to the ERG gene at 21q22. In two of our Ewing's tumor cases, we were able to show at the sequence level that the translocation between chromosomes 16 and 21 similarly results in a FUS/ERG fusion. In one case, exons 1-5 and most of exon 6 of FUS were fused in-frame to exon 9 of ERG; in the other case, FUS exons 1-7 were fused in-frame to ERG exons 8-9. The functional fusion transcript is expected to be expressed from the der(21)t(16;21) derivative. In the two other t(16;21)-positive Ewing's cases, we performed bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on metaphases and interphase nuclei to demonstrate colocalization of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing FUS and ERG genes, also highly suggestive of fusion gene formation. These represent the first four cases where FUS, rather than EWS, is rearranged with an ETS-family transcription factor in Ewing's tumors. Our data provide additional evidence that the transactivation domains of the TET family of RNA-binding proteins (such as EWS and FUS) are interchangeable, and suggests a novel mechanism of oncogenesis in Ewing's tumors.","['Medical Research Council Cancer Cell Unit, Hutchison/MRC Research Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2XZ, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the competence of the circulating dendritic cell (DC) compartment in CLL patients has not been investigated. To address this issue, we sorted DC precursors from the peripheral blood of CLL patients and found a profoundly altered compartment as compared with normal donors. CLL DCs proved a morphologically and phenotypically immature population, lacking the maturation antigen CD83 and the costimulatory molecule CD80, unable to induce a significant proliferative response in allo-mixed lymphocyte reaction, with a reduced ability to release interleukin 12 and to drive a type 1 T-cell response. To investigate whether these defects could be ascribed to inhibiting soluble factors released by the leukemic clone, DCs were generated in vitro from normal monocytes in the presence of allogeneic CLL cells. The addition of CLL cells induced similar markers of abnormal maturation and functional impairment with an inhibition in the expression of costimulatory molecules and a reduction of their allo-stimulatory ability. The blocking of interleukin 6 activity was able to revert the inhibition in a proportion of patients. Taken together, these findings indicate that mechanisms of tumor-induced DC inhibition are operational in CLL patients, resulting in both maturative and functional defects in the circulating DC compartment, with a potential functional impact in the regulation of in vivo T-cell immune responses.","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. orsini@bce.uniroma1.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined that all three drugs induced the accumulation of cells with a 4n DNA content and apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. HDACI-induced mitochondrial membrane damage and apoptosis were inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2, but not by the polycaspase inhibitor N-tert-butoxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk). Moreover, induction of a G(1)-S checkpoint through overexpression of p16(INK4A) or suppression of de novo protein synthesis also inhibited HDACI-induced cell death. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-2, which is poorly inhibited by zVAD-fmk, was concomitant with HDACI-induced death; however, full processing of caspase-2 to the p19 active form was blocked by Bcl-2. Whereas all three drugs induce the activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bid upstream of mitochondrial membrane disruption, Bid cleavage in response to depsipeptide was significantly attenuated by zVAD-fmk. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and oxamflatin could kill both P-glycoprotein (P-gp)(+) MDR cells and their P-gp(-) counterparts, whereas depsipeptide was shown to be a substrate for P-gp and was less effective in killing P-gp(+) cells.

Gain-of-function mutations in codon 816 of the catalytic domain of human Kit [codon 814 of murine Kit (mKit)] are found in patients with mastocytosis, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. There are no drugs that inhibit the activity of Kit catalytic domain mutants to a greater extent than wild-type Kit. The objective of this study was to understand the biochemical mechanisms mediating mast cell transformation by this Kit mutant to identify molecular targets for pharmacological intervention. To this end, we examined signaling pathways activated in the murine mast cell line IC2 infected with either wild-type (IC2-mKit) or mutant mKit (IC2-mKit(D814Y)). In this study, we show that mKit(D814Y) is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine 719, and this likely results in constitutive association with activated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K). In vitro growth of IC2-mKit(D814Y) cells is more sensitive to inhibition of PI3K than SCF-induced growth of IC2-mKit cells. s.c. injection of IC2-mKit(D814Y) in syngeneic mice results in mast cell tumors. To determine whether inhibition of PI3K could reduce mKit(D814Y)-mediated tumorigenicity, mice were treated with 1.5 mg/kg wortmannin three times a week. Five weeks after injection of tumor cells, a 75% reduction in tumor weight was observed when wortmannin treatments were initiated 2 days after inoculation with tumor cells. A 66% reduction occurred when treatment was initiated 2 weeks after inoculation. Treatment with wortmannin increased necrosis in the tumors, and this was associated with apoptosis. Interestingly, there was no effect on tumor vasculature. Thus, PI3K is required for survival and growth of the IC2-mKit(D814Y) mast cell line both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may provide insight into designing strategies for treatment of mastocytosis and other diseases associated with mutations in the Kit catalytic domain.","['Basic Research Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, Building 567, Room 226, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. krupas@ncifcrf.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore asked whether JunB acted as a negative regulator of B-cell development, proliferation, and transformation. We used transgenic mice that expressed JunB under the control of the ubiquitin C promoter; these displayed increased JunB levels in both B- and T-lymphoid cells. JunB transgenic cells of B-lymphoid, but not of T-lymphoid, origin responded poorly to mitogenic stimuli. Furthermore, JunB transgenic cells were found to be less susceptible to the transforming potential of the Abelson oncogene in vitro. In addition, overexpression of JunB partially protected transgenic mice against the oncogenic challenge in vivo. However, transformed B cells eventually escaped from the inhibitory effect of JunB: the proliferative response was similar in explanted tumor-derived cells from transgenic animals and those from wild-type controls. Our results identify JunB as a novel regulator of B-cell proliferation and transformation.","['Department of Pharmacology, Vienna University, Wahringerstrasse 13A, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,20030807,,,,,,,,

The patients with LONIPCs were subclassified into those with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) (6 patients), with interstitial pneumonia (IP) (11 patients), or with both BO and IP (1 patient). The presence of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly associated with the development of LONIPCs (P =.0008). Liver or skin involvement in chronic GVHD was not associated, but sicca syndrome was significantly associated with the development of LONIPCs (P <.0001). Most of the IP patients (58.3%) responded well to immunosuppressive treatment, while BO patients did not respond to the therapy. Eight of the 18 patients with LONIPCs died. The major cause of death was respiratory failure (62.5%). The relapse rate of primary malignant disease in the LONIPC patients was significantly lower than that of non-LONIPC patients (1 of 17 [5.9%] versus 16 of 52 [30.8%]; P =.0387).

Herein, we investigate the contribution of Rex in HTLV-1 immortalization of primary T cells in vitro and viral survival in an infectious rabbit animal model. A Rex-deficient HTLV-1 (HTLVRex-) was constructed and characterized for viral gene expression, protein production, and immortalization capacity. Cells transiently transfected with the HTLVRex- proviral clone produced low detectable levels of p19 Gag. 729HTLVRex- stable transfectants produced functional Tax, but undetectable levels of Rex or p19 Gag.

Rabbits inoculated with irradiated 729HTLVRex- cells or 729HTLVRex- cells transiently transfected with a Rex cDNA expression plasmid failed to become persistently infected or mount a detectable antibody response to the viral gene products.

In the present report, we show that the GA3P is a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase (topo) I and topo II, irrespective of the presence or absence of the lactate group. Dextran sulfate also showed similar level of inhibition of topo I and topo II. We also demonstrated that, unlike camptothecin (CPT) or teniposide (VM-26), the inhibition of topo I or topo II by the polysaccharide does not involve accumulation of DNA-topo I/II cleavable complexes, clearly showing that they are not topo poisons but catalytic inhibitors with dual activity. Furthermore, the polysaccharide, when added to the reaction mixture with CPT or VM-26, inhibited stabilization of cleavable complex induced by the latter compounds. In addition, when added to the reaction mixture after the formation of the cleavable complexes by topo poisons, CPT for topo I and VM-26 for topo II, either GA3P or dextran sulfate diminished the amount of the complexes already accumulated, i.e. reversal of the reaction. These results suggest that the polysaccharides bind to the enzymes with high affinities, and that, as for topo I/II inhibition, the GA3P shares a common mechanism with dextran sulfate. As examined in vitro with a human cancer cell line panel, GA3P exhibited significant cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cells. These findings show that the polysaccharide GA3P would prove to be a potential anticancer chemotherapeutic agent with dual activity of topo I and topo II catalytic inhibition.","['Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, 1-236 Tangi-machi, Hachiouji, Tokyo 192-8577, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Stochastic spreadsheet model. SAMPLE POPULATION: A commercial Holstein dairy herd with 100 milking cows. PROCEDURES: A spreadsheet model was developed. The overall cost of infection included the cost of clinical disease (ie, lymphosarcoma [LS]) and the effects of subclinical infection on milk production and premature culling. Model input values and distributions were designed to reflect economic conditions in the mid-Atlantic region. Relative costs of infection and control were calculated for infection prevalences of 20, 50, and 80%. RESULTS: Estimated mean cost to the producer per case of LS was 412 dollars; for a herd with a 50% prevalence of BLV infection, annual incidence of LS was 0.66. Mean annual cost of subclinical infection at a 50% prevalence of infection was 6,406 dollars. Mean annual cost of a test-and-manage control program was 1,765 dollars. The cost of clinical disease and subclinical infection varied substantially with the prevalence of infection, whereas the cost of control varied with herd size. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that a basic BLV control program may be economically beneficial in herds in which the prevalence of BLV infection is > or = 12.5%. Farm-specific considerations may factor prominently when weighing the costs and benefits of an individual BLV control program.","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, College Park, MD 20742, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A recombinant retroviral vector MSCV-ibE-IRES-eGFP was constructed to express intracellular single-chain antibody (intrabody) against ABL tyrosine kinase domain in CML cells. K562 cells were transduced with the retrovirus, eGFP+ cells were then selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The intrabody mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BCR/ABL and c-ABL protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity in the cells was examined. Transduced cells and control group K562 cells were transplanted into nude mice respectively and the tumor sizes were dynamically observed. RESULTS: K562-ibE cell was obtained. Expression of the BCR/ABL and c-ABL protein tyrosine kinase activity of harvested K562-ibE cells were markedly inhibited. At 14, 21 and 28 days after cell injection, the tumor volumes of experimental mice were obviously smaller than that of control mice, about one half of the control groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The growth of K562-ibE cells was significantly inhibited in vivo. It is possible that inhibition of the BCR/ABL protein tyrosine kinase activity by the intrabody blocked BCR/ABL signal transduction pathway, promoted apoptosis and reduced tumorigenicity of K562 cells in vivo.","['State Key Lab of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, CAMS, PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Adhesion assay and adhesion blocking assay were respectively applied to measure the effect of PF4 and/or adhesion molecule monoclonal antibodies on the adhesion property of KG1a. The expressions of adhesion molecules were determined by RT-PCR and FACS analysis. RESULTS: The adhesion of KG1a cells to ECV-304 was significantly enhanced in the presence of PF4. Such enhancement was also observed when KG1a or ECV-304 cells were separately treated with PF4 before interaction. The adhesion capacity of KG1a cells was reduced when cells were co-incubated with the blocking monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CD49d, CD106, CD54, respectively. In contrast, MoAbs against CD62L, CD62P and CD62E had no such effect. During a period of 3 hours when KG1a or ECV-304 cells were respectively incubated with PF4, the mRNA expressions of CD49 d, CD54 were up-regulated. Furthermore, when KG1a or ECV-304 cells were incubated with PF4 for 2 hours, respectively, the percentages of CD49d+ KG1a cells and CD54+ ECV-304 were increased significantly.
