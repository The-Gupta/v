Acquisition of drug resistance is not more evident elsewhere than in the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Hence, even though imatinib initially produces remission in the chronic phase, ultimately these therapeutics fail via the emergence of drug resistance, in which chronic myelogenous leukemia could inevitably progress to a terminal blast phase culminating in fatal outcome. Technically, it is challenging to predict the onset of drug resistance in a small number of oncogene-transformed cells, making the decision of when and how to employ second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or employ novel compounds that would be of benefit in treating drug-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants mainly retrospective. Here, we characterize a rapid and sensitive real-time fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based assay that is able to detect the in vivo activity of Bcr-Abl and its inhibition by small molecule compounds. Due to its real-time and in vivo nature, such an approach has the potential to monitor a drug-resistant phenotype, as well as to identify pharmaceutical agents that inhibit drug-resistant Bcr-Abl oncoproteins in vivo.","['Tunceroglu, Ahmet', 'Matsuda, Michiyuki', 'Birge, Raymond B']","['Tunceroglu A', 'Matsuda M', 'Birge RB']","['University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 185 South Orange Avenue MSB-E650, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. tuncerah@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 GM055760/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM055760-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM080308/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM080308/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20100903,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biosensing Techniques/methods', 'COS Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Computer Systems', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",PMC3318989,['NIHMS234513'],2010/09/08 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0623 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0623 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Nov;9(11):3065-73. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0623.

Nilotinib was discovered following re-engineering of imatinib, employing structural biology and medicinal chemistry strategies to optimise cellular potency and selectivity towards BCR-ABL1. Through evolving only to conserve these properties, this resulted in significant structural differences between nilotinib and imatinib, quantified by a Daylight-fingerprint-Tanimoto similarity coefficient of 0.6, with the meaning of this absolute measure being supported by an analysis of similarity distributions of similar drug-like molecules. This dissimilarity is reflected in the drugs having substantially different preclinical pharmacology and a lack of cross-intolerance in CML patients, which translates into nilotinib being an efficacious treatment for CML, with a favourable side-effect profile.","['Manley, Paul W', 'Stiefl, Nikolaus', 'Cowan-Jacob, Sandra W', 'Kaufman, Susan', 'Mestan, Jurgen', 'Wartmann, Markus', 'Wiesmann, Marion', 'Woodman, Richard', 'Gallagher, Neil']","['Manley PW', 'Stiefl N', 'Cowan-Jacob SW', 'Kaufman S', 'Mestan J', 'Wartmann M', 'Wiesmann M', 'Woodman R', 'Gallagher N']","['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland. paul.manley@novartis.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100814,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Piperazines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2011/01/19 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(10)00771-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2010.08.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2010 Oct 1;18(19):6977-86. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2010.08.026.

Over-expression of Notch3 and gain of function mutations in the Notch1 gene have been reported. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of Notch signalling on apoptosis in human T-ALL cell lines and to identify targets of Notch signalling that may mediate this effect. Functional studies showed that inhibition of Notch signalling using gamma secretase inhibitors promoted glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in cells carrying gain of function mutations in Notch1. Moreover, ectopic expression of constitutively activated Notch provided protection against glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, indicating that signalling via Notch may also contribute to the development of T-ALL by conferring resistance to apoptosis. Microarray analysis revealed that GIMAP5, a gene coding for an anti-apoptotic intracellular protein, is upregulated by Notch in T-ALL cell lines. Knockdown of GIMAP5 expression using siRNA promoted glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in T-ALL cells carrying gain of function mutations in Notch1 and in T-ALL cells engineered to express ectopic constitutively activated Notch indicating that Notch signalling protects T-ALL cells from apoptosis by upregulating the expression of GIMAP5.","['Chadwick, Nicholas', 'Zeef, Leo', 'Portillo, Virginia', 'Boros, Joanna', 'Hoyle, Sarah', 'van Doesburg, Jaap C L', 'Buckle, Anne-Marie']","['Chadwick N', 'Zeef L', 'Portillo V', 'Boros J', 'Hoyle S', 'van Doesburg JC', 'Buckle AM']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocenter, University of Manchester, Manchester M1 7DN, UK. n.chadwick@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (GIMAP5 protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(10)00163-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2010 Oct 15;45(3):201-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.07.006.,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Regulating this equilibrium entails complex interactions between tumor and host, modulated by a set of surface molecules expressed by the CLL cell according to environmental conditions. The result is a constantly shifting pattern of resistance, apoptosis and proliferation. The CD38 surface molecule is an independent negative prognostic factor expressed by approximately one-third of CLL patients. Our view is that CD38 is crucial to tumor-host communication and that its signals are detrimental to clinical outcome. CD38(+) CLL cells can proliferate in vitro in the presence of anti-CD38 mAbs and IL-2 and are more sensitive to the effects of the CXCL12 chemokine. Blockage of CD38 signals impairs CLL cell movement from blood to lymphoid organs, as confirmed using animal models. One model to be explored considers CD38 a key component of the CLL invadosome, a still hypothetical membrane domain containing adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors and matrix metalloproteases. Some components of the invadosome are genetically polymorphic, explaining heterogeneity in functional response. The CD38 gene shows genetic differences in the promoter region, some of which represent an independent risk for Richter transformation. In addition to driving the clinical outcome of the disease, CD38 is thus an excellent candidate therapeutic target for a significant subset of CLL patients.","['Deaglio, Silvia', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Deaglio S', 'Vaisitti T', 'Zucchetto A', 'Gattei V', 'Malavasi F']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino Medical School, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100909,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,['EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)'],IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(10)00075-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2010 Dec;20(6):416-23. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.08.003.

In mouse models, photoreceptors can be protected from death by hypoxic preconditioning. Preconditioning in low oxygen stabilizes and activates hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which play a major role in the hypoxic response of tissues including the retina. We show that a tissue-specific knockdown of von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) activated HIF transcription factors in normoxic conditions in the retina. Sustained activation of HIF1 and HIF2 was accompanied by persisting embryonic vasculatures in the posterior eye and the iris. Embryonic vessels persisted into adulthood and led to a severely abnormal mature vessel system with vessels penetrating the photoreceptor layer in adult mice. The sustained hypoxia-like response also activated the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-controlled endogenous molecular cell survival pathway. However, this was not sufficient to protect the retina against massive cell death in all retinal layers of adult mice. Caspases 1, 3 and 8 were upregulated during the degeneration as were several VHL target genes connected to the extracellular matrix. Misregulation of these genes may influence retinal structure and may therefore facilitate growth of vessels into the photoreceptor layer. Thus, an early and sustained activation of a hypoxia-like response in retinal cells leads to abnormal vasculature and severe retinal degeneration in the adult mouse retina.","['Lange, Christina', 'Caprara, Christian', 'Tanimoto, Naoyuki', 'Beck, Susanne', 'Huber, Gesine', 'Samardzija, Marijana', 'Seeliger, Mathias', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Lange C', 'Caprara C', 'Tanimoto N', 'Beck S', 'Huber G', 'Samardzija M', 'Seeliger M', 'Grimm C']","['Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. christina.lange@usz.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100915,United States,Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Blindness/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hypoxia, Brain/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinal Artery/embryology/pathology', 'Retinal Degeneration/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein/*genetics']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0969-9961(10)00300-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Dis. 2011 Jan;41(1):119-30. doi: 10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.028.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of DPP2 inhibition and the role of DPP2 in cell cycle in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened 152 peripheral blood samples from patients with CLL in an apoptosis assay with AX8819, a DPP2-specific inhibitor. The apoptotic response was correlated with B-cell receptor signaling and cell cycle and molecular prognostic factors. RESULTS: We categorized CLL into two prognostic subgroups. Inhibition of DPP2 induced apoptosis in 60% of CLL, while 40% were resistant to apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis correlated with unmutated IgV(H) and increased ZAP-70 expression and was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Sensitive CLL B cells expressed high p27, low c-Myc protein levels and decreased Syk phosphorylation, indicative of a resting phenotype. DPP2 inhibition in those cells resulted in apoptosis accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of Syk, degradation of p27 and p130, and upregulation of c-Myc, indicative of activation and inappropriate cell cycle entry. Resistant CLL demonstrated baseline low p27 and high c-Myc protein levels and increased pSyk, indicative of an activated phenotype. Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 in this subset of CLL partially reversed apoptosis resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The DPP2 apoptosis assay provides a reliable prognostic factor in CLL. CLL B cells sensitive to DPP2 inhibition are in true G(0), while resistant CLL B-cells are partially activated.

The results revealed that VO-salen at 6-32 muM inhibited K562 proliferation with no distinct alteration in cell morphology, extent of apoptosis and/or differentiation. Our results indicated that VO-salen complex has just a cytostatic effect and capable of arresting the affected cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle. In addition, we evaluated the combined effects of VO-salen complex and taxol. The cell cycle analyses showed that VO-salen complex enhanced taxol-induced G2/M arrest and also increased taxol-induced apoptosis through a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax which might account for the decrease in the apoptosis threshold among the affected cells. These findings support that combination of VO-salen, as a chemosensitizer, and taxol might constitute an affective new strategy for leukemia therapy.","['Meshkini, Azadeh', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh']","['Meshkini A', 'Yazdanparast R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, P.

Here we demonstrate by fluorescence cross-correlated spectroscopy that native IL-2Rbeta and gammac assemble spontaneously at the surface of living human leukemia T cells (Kit-225 cell line) in the absence of IL-2 and with 1:1 stoichiometry. The dissociation constant of the membrane-embedded IL-2Rbeta/gammac complex is measured in situ. Forster fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyzed by confocal microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells between combination pairs of various-length receptor chain constructions, using green fluorescent protein derivatives as cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal extensions, showed that IL-2Rbeta:ECFP and gammac:EYFP bind each other through their extracellular domains, and that IL-2 binding brings their transmembrane domains 30 A closer together. These observations demonstrate that IL-2Rbeta/gammac heterodimers are preformed and that their cytoplasmic domains, carrying Janus kinase (Jak) 1 and Jak3, are pulled and tethered together on cytokine binding, triggering signaling transduction. IL-2 binding stabilizes IL-2/IL-2R complexes in membrane nanodomains that promote Jak1/Jak3 phosphorylation. The complexes then interact with the cytoskeleton, which slows receptor diffusion (as measured by fluorescence cross-correlated spectroscopy) and promotes STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 5 phosphorylation. Separation of IL-2-activated receptors from Triton-lysed cells in detergent-resistant membrane nanodomains by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient confirmed their presence in lipid rafts. The release of the IL-2-activated receptor from cytochalasin-treated cells and the IL-2-induced recruitment of actin and tubulin, analyzed by immunoprecipitation, confirmed that the activated receptor interacts with the cytoskeleton. Although IL-2Ralpha (the third chain that gives the IL-2Rbeta/gammac receptor core its high affinity for IL-2) is highly expressed at the cell surface and mainly clustered in membrane microdomains at the surface of Kit-225 cells, the few free IL-2Ralpha present bind last to the IL-2/IL-2Rbeta/gammac complex and lock IL-2 to its binding site for prolonged action, promoting signal amplification.","['Pillet, Anne-Helene', 'Lavergne, Vincent', 'Pasquier, Virginie', 'Gesbert, Franck', 'Theze, Jacques', 'Rose, Thierry']","['Pillet AH', 'Lavergne V', 'Pasquier V', 'Gesbert F', 'Theze J', 'Rose T']","[""Institut Pasteur, Departement Infection et Epidemiologie, Departement d'Immunologie, Unite d'Immunogenetique Cellulaire, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100921,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(10)00946-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2010.08.056 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 Nov 12;403(5):671-92. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.08.056.

High stathmin levels have been associated with the development of resistance to the widely used anti-cancer drug taxol (((R))Taxol, paclitaxel). The mechanisms of stathmin-mediated taxol resistance are not well-understood at the molecular level. To better understand the role of stathmin in taxol resistance, we stably overexpressed stathmin twofold in BT549 human breast cancer cells and characterized several cell processes involved in the mechanism of action of taxol. After stable overexpression of stathmin, neither the cell doubling time nor the mitotic index was altered and the microtubule polymer mass was reduced only modestly (by 18%). Unexpectedly, microtubule dynamicity was reduced by 29% after stathmin overexpression, resulting primarily from reduction in the catastrophe frequency. Sensitivity to taxol was reduced significantly (by 44%) in a clonogenic assay, and stathmin appeared to protect the cells from the spindle-damaging effects of taxol. The results suggest that in the stably stathmin-overexpressing clones, compensatory gene expression occurred that resulted in normal rates of cell proliferation and prevented the increase in catastrophe frequency expected in response to stathmin. Stathmin overexpression protected the cells from taxol-induced abnormal mitoses, and thus induced taxol resistance. Using offgel IEF/PAGE difference gel electrophoresis, we identified a number of proteins whose expression is reduced in the taxol-resistant stathmin-overexpressing cell lines, including proteins involved in the cytoskeleton and cell structure, the stress response, protein folding, glycolysis, and catalysis.","['Balasubramani, Manimalha', 'Nakao, Chitose', 'Uechi, Guy T', 'Cardamone, John', 'Kamath, Kathy', 'Leslie, Kristen L', 'Balachandran, Raghavan', 'Wilson, Leslie', 'Day, Billy W', 'Jordan, Mary Ann']","['Balasubramani M', 'Nakao C', 'Uechi GT', 'Cardamone J', 'Kamath K', 'Leslie KL', 'Balachandran R', 'Wilson L', 'Day BW', 'Jordan MA']","['Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratories, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR000005/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024153/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057291-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR024153/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024153-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA057291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100909,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stathmin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic Index', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Stathmin/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3017223,['NIHMS234031'],2010/09/08 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(10)00310-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.08.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2011 Jun 17;722(2):154-64. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.08.019.

In this article, we review the structure, regulation and biological functions of MKL1.

During B-cell maturation, sIg accumulates somatic mutations in the Ig variable region (V) genes and tumours retain these patterns, thereby revealing the point of differentiation of the B cell of origin. The importance of origin is strikingly illustrated in CLL where the two major subsets with distinctive clinical behaviour express either unmutated (U) or mutated (M) V genes. Biased selection of VDJ genes also occurs in CLL, allowing further identification of the normal B-cell counterparts, with U-CLL apparently derived from circulating naive B cells. Surface IgM of CLL is functional, with evidence for ongoing interaction with antigen in vivo. Signalling connects to cell survival, proliferation and migration, key determinants of tumour cell behaviour. Probing of B-cell receptor-mediated signalling pathways, either constitutively activated or open for activation, reveals dynamic, possibly repetitive, stimulatory events, likely to occur in tissue sites. Subtle differences in signal responsiveness between U-CLL or M-CLL subsets, together with microenvironmental factors, may explain clinical outcome. Knowledge of the critical signalling pathways should reveal the steps vulnerable to inhibition and allow development of a new range of therapeutic drugs, targeted particularly against the more aggressive subset, U-CLL.","['Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda']","['Packham G', 'Stevenson F']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100909,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(10)00076-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2010 Dec;20(6):391-9. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.08.004.

Along with the improvement of laboratory techniques and the widespread availability of multiparameter flow cytometry, the finding of tiny aberrant B-cell populations became more frequent, prompting the need for clinical and biological definition of the nature of this condition and its relationship with leukemia development. MBL seems to be a melting-pot containing several entities, identical in terms of phenotype but with extremely different risks of leukemia development (from low to none) that seem to correlate with the number of B lymphocytes. CLL-like MBL observed in the clinical setting (""Clinical MBL""), usually being characterized by lymphocytosis, demonstrated a sizeable, even if low (1.1-1.4% per year), risk of leukemic progression, but represents a minority of all MBL cases. The vast majority of CLL-like MBL are detected in general population screenings and do not likely have a risk of CLL that is substantially higher than that of unaffected individuals. Interestingly, MBL frequency increases with age, being virtually undetectable under 40 years of age but being present in 50-75% of the people older than 90 years. It has been proposed that MBL could be interpreted as an epiphenomenon of a chronic and persistent antigenic stimulation. The (rare) possibility to evolve into a frank leukemia might then depend on biological and molecular factors insofar unknown that may modify the modality of cell reaction as well as the potential to acquire further genetic abnormalities. Therefore, the real challenge of the next years in the MBL research field is not to increase the sensitivity of detection, neither to implement screening protocols to be applied to the general population, rather to unravel the biologic features that, at individual level, will identify those (few) cases that are at risk of developing a progressive disease.","['Scarfo, Lydia', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Fazi, Claudia', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Scarfo L', 'Dagklis A', 'Scielzo C', 'Fazi C', 'Ghia P']","['Laboratory of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Molecular Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 58, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100915,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology/pathology']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(10)00077-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2010 Dec;20(6):384-90. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.08.005.

We then found evidence that Cas X causes cell death via apoptotic pathways, corroborating the potential of casearins as compounds with promising antitumor-related properties.","['Ferreira, Paulo M Pinheiro', 'Santos, Andre G', 'Tininis, Aristeu G', 'Costa, Patricia M', 'Cavalheiro, Alberto J', 'Bolzani, Vanderlan S', 'Moraes, Manoel O', 'Costa-Lotufo, Leticia V', 'Montenegro, Raquel C', 'Pessoa, Claudia']","['Ferreira PM', 'Santos AG', 'Tininis AG', 'Costa PM', 'Cavalheiro AJ', 'Bolzani VS', 'Moraes MO', 'Costa-Lotufo LV', 'Montenegro RC', 'Pessoa C']","['Universidade Federal do Piaui, 64.600-000 Picos, Piaui, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0', '(1-(acetyloxy)-3,5,6,6a,7,8,9,10-octahydro-10-hydroxy-7,8-dimethyl-7-(3-methylpen', 'ta-2,4-dien-1-yl)naphtho(1,8a-c)furan-3,5-diyl dibutanoate)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Diterpenes, Clerodane)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '24470-47-1 (hardwickic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Clerodane/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(10)00528-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2010.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Dec 5;188(3):497-504. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2010.08.008.,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methotrexate is used widely to treat various neoplastic diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, solid cancers, and autoimmune diseases. We hypothesized that resveratrol has a potential to decrease the oxidant damage in MTX-induced hepatic injury. METHODS: Following a single dose of methotrexate (20 mg/kg, i.p.), either saline or resveratrol (10 mg/kg, orally) was administered for 5 days. After decapitation of the rats, trunk blood was obtained and the liver was removed to measure malondialdehyde and glutathione levels, myeloperoxidase and thromboplastic activities and collagen content. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase activity were measured in the serum samples, while TNF-alpha and total antioxidant capacity were assayed in plasma samples. RESULTS: Our results showed that MTX administration increased the hepatic malondialdehyde levels, myeloperoxidase and thromboplastic activities and collagen contents and decreased glutathione, while these alterations were reversed in resveratrol-treated group. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities and TNF-alpha level observed following MTX treatment was depressed with resveratrol. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that resveratrol protects against methotrexate-induced hepatic injury and may be of therapeutic potential in alleviating the systemic side effects of chemotherapeutics.","['Tunali-Akbay, Tugba', 'Sehirli, Ozer', 'Ercan, Feriha', 'Sener, Goksel']","['Tunali-Akbay T', 'Sehirli O', 'Ercan F', 'Sener G']","['Marmara University School of Dentistry, Department of Biochemistry, Istanbul, Turkey. ttunali@marmara.edu.tr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Canada,J Pharm Pharm Sci,"Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",9807281,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/drug effects/metabolism']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2010/12/18 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18433/j30k5q [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharm Sci. 2010;13(2):303-10. doi: 10.18433/j30k5q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydrogen peroxide (15 muM) and taurine chloramine (200 muM) induced HL 60 differentiation, which was detected by CD11b expression and superoxide production. Cd11b and p67phox mRNA expression was also augmented by these oxidants. In contrast, reducing chemicals, such as dithiothreitol, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol and N-acetylcysteine inhibited CD11b expression. Notably, DMSO inhibited methionine sulfoxide reductase activity, induced heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) mRNA and enhanced oxidant-induced cell death, which indicated that DMSO intensified oxidative stress. After the addition of oxidants, ho-1 expression preceded the cd11b expression. Vicinal dithiol-reactive phenylarsine oxide (50 nM) also increased CD11b expression induced by DMSO or ATRA. These observations suggested that oxidative stress enhanced granulocytic differentiation of HL 60 cells and that leukaemic cell differentiation was affected by cellular redox status.","['Ogino, Tetsuya', 'Ozaki, Michitaka', 'Matsukawa, Akihiro']","['Ogino T', 'Ozaki M', 'Matsukawa A']","['Pathology & Experimental Medicine, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Oxidants)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', '51036-13-6 (N-chlorotaurine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Taurine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,2010/09/08 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/09/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10715762.2010.503757 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2010 Nov;44(11):1328-37. doi: 10.3109/10715762.2010.503757.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A molecular analysis of sixty-six cases, including soft tissue, bone, and visceral lesions, showing common involvement of the EWSR1 gene.",1114-24,10.1002/gcc.20819 [doi],"The diagnosis of myoepithelial (ME) tumors outside salivary glands remains challenging, especially in unusual clinical presentations, such as bone or visceral locations. A few reports have indicated EWSR1 gene rearrangement in soft tissue ME tumors, and, in one case each, the fusion partner was identified as either PBX1 or ZNF444. However, larger studies to investigate whether these genetic abnormalities are recurrent or restricted to tumors in soft tissue locations are lacking. Sixty-six ME tumors mainly from soft tissue (71%), but also from skin, bone, and visceral locations, characterized by classic morphological features and supporting immunoprofile were studied. Gene rearrangements in EWSR1, FUS, PBX1, and ZNF444 were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. EWSR1 gene rearrangement was detected in 45% of the cases. A EWSR1-POU5F1 fusion was identified in a pediatric soft tissue tumor by 3'Rapid Amplification of cDNA Euds (RACE) and subsequently confirmed in four additional soft tissue tumors in children and young adults. An EWSR1-PBX1 fusion was seen in five cases, whereas EWSR1-ZNF444 and FUS gene rearrangement was noted in one pulmonary tumor each. In conclusion, EWSR1 gene rearrangement is a common event in ME tumors arising outside salivary glands, irrespective of anatomical location. EWSR1-negative tumors were more often benign, superficially located, and showed ductal differentiation, suggesting the possibility of genetically distinct groups. A subset of soft tissue ME tumors with clear cell morphology harbor an EWSR1-POU5F1 fusion, which can be used as a molecular diagnostic test in difficult cases. These findings do not support a pathogenetic relationship between soft tissue ME tumors and their salivary gland counterparts.","['Antonescu, Cristina R', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Chang, Ning-En', 'Pawel, Bruce R', 'Travis, William', 'Katabi, Nora', 'Edelman, Morris', 'Rosenberg, Andrew E', 'Nielsen, G Petur', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Fletcher, Christopher D M']","['Antonescu CR', 'Zhang L', 'Chang NE', 'Pawel BR', 'Travis W', 'Katabi N', 'Edelman M', 'Rosenberg AE', 'Nielsen GP', 'Dal Cin P', 'Fletcher CD']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York City, NY 10021, USA. antonesc@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['P01 CA047179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA47179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EWSR1 protein, human)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Myoepithelioma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*genetics', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'Zinc Fingers']",PMC3540416,['NIHMS377724'],2010/09/04 06:00,2011/02/03 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20819 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Dec;49(12):1114-24. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20819.,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) on 43 BCP-ALL patients for the detection of the most common deletions among these genes and compared the results to those obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR). There was good correlation between methods for CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, and PAX5 deletions in the majority of cases and MLPA confirmed the presence of deletions within the PAR1 region in two of three cases identified by FISH. Small intragenic aberrations detected by MLPA, which were below the resolution of FISH for CDKN2A/B (n = 7), IKZF1 (n = 3), and PAX5 (n = 3) were confirmed by qPCR. MLPA and qPCR were unable to detect populations present at a low level (<20%) by FISH. In addition, although MLPA identified the presence of a deletion, it was unable to discern the presence of mixed cell populations which had been identified by FISH: CDKN2A/B (n = 3), IKZF1 (n = 1), PAX5 (n = 2), and PAR1 deletion (n = 1). Nevertheless, this study has demonstrated that MLPA is a robust technique for the reliable detection of CNA involving multiple targets in a single test and thus is ideal for rapid high throughput testing of large cohorts with a view to establishing incidence and prognostic significance.","['Schwab, C J', 'Jones, L R', 'Morrison, H', 'Ryan, S L', 'Yigittop, H', 'Schouten, J P', 'Harrison, C J']","['Schwab CJ', 'Jones LR', 'Morrison H', 'Ryan SL', 'Yigittop H', 'Schouten JP', 'Harrison CJ']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, cdc', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Lymphocytes', '*Molecular Probe Techniques', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,,2010/09/04 06:00,2011/02/03 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20818 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Dec;49(12):1104-13. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20818.,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results indicated significantly reduced white matter volumes and cognitive testing scores in the ALL group compared to controls. Maternal education was inversely related to both global and regional white matter and directly related to gray matter in ALL and was directly related to both gray and white matter in controls, consistent with the cognitive reserve hypothesis. Cognitive performance was associated with different brain regions in ALL compared to controls. Maternal education was significantly positively correlated with working and verbal memory in ALL as well as processing speed and verbal memory in controls, improving models of cognitive outcome over medical and/or demographic predictors. Our findings suggest that cognitive reserve may be an important factor in brain injury and cognitive outcome in ALL.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) activity has been described as a relevant factor in the chemotherapeutic failure and correlated to a poor prognosis in these malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the antineoplastic activity of 3beta-acetyl tormentic acid (3ATA), a triterpene isolated from C. lyratiloba, on Lucena-1, an MDR leukemia cell line, that overexpressed P-gp/ABCB1. Results showing that this triterpene induced DNA-fragmentation, activation of caspase-3 and cytochrome c release indicated that its activity is mediated by the activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Interestingly, this triterpene did not interfere with P-gp/ABCB1 expression or activity, indicating that induction of death is not mediated by any effect on this protein. Moreover, the results show that none of the others triterpenes from C. lyratiloba were able to modulate the activity of P-gp/ABCB1. Together these results suggest 3ATA and the other triterpenes as a promising material for the development of anti-neoplastic drugs for leukemia and other tumors independent of P-gp/ABCB1 activity or expression.","['Rocha, Gleice da Graca', 'Simoes, Marisol', 'Oliveira, Rodrigo Rodrigues', 'Kaplan, Maria Auxiliadora Coelho', 'Gattass, Cerli Rocha']","['Rocha Gda G', 'Simoes M', 'Oliveira RR', 'Kaplan MA', 'Gattass CR']","['Lab. de Imunologia Celular, Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, CCS Bl G, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 21949-900, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100904,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '53155-25-2 (euscaphic acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', '*Cecropia Plant/chemistry', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Triterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",,,2010/09/04 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9524-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Feb;30(1):105-13. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9524-1.

B7-H1 participates in the immunoescape of cancer cells and is also involved in the long-term persistence of leukemic cells in a mouse model of leukemia. B7-H1 can be constitutively expressed by cancer cells, but is also induced by various stimuli. Therefore, we examined the constitutive and inducible expression of B7-H1 and the consequences of this expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed B7-H1 expression in a cohort of 79 patients with AML. In addition, we studied blast cells after incubation with interferon-gamma or toll-like receptors (TLR) ligands. Finally, we evaluated functionality of cytotoxic T-cell activity against blast cells. Expression of B7-H1 upon diagnosis was high in 18% of patients. Expression of TLR2, 4 and 9 was detected in one-third of AML samples. Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 ligands or IFN-gamma induced by B7-H1 was found to protect AML cells from CTL-mediated lysis. Spontaneous B7-H1 expression was also found to be enhanced upon relapse in some patients. MEK inhibitors, including UO126 and AZD6244, reduced B7-H1 expression and restored CTL-mediated lysis of blast cells. In AML, B7-H1 expression by blasts represents a possible immune escape mechanism. The inducibility of B7-H1 expression by IFN-gamma or TLR ligands suggests that various stimuli, either produced during the immune response against leukemia cells or released by infectious microorganisms, could protect leukemic cells from T cells. The efficacy of MEK inhibitors against B7-H1-mediated inhibition of CTLs suggests a possible cancer immunotherapy strategy using targeted drugs.","['Berthon, Celine', 'Driss, Virginie', 'Liu, Jizhong', 'Kuranda, Klaudia', 'Leleu, Xavier', 'Jouy, Nathalie', 'Hetuin, Dominique', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Berthon C', 'Driss V', 'Liu J', 'Kuranda K', 'Leleu X', 'Jouy N', 'Hetuin D', 'Quesnel B']","['INSERM, unit 837, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100904,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*physiology']",PMC2945474,,2010/09/04 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0909-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Dec;59(12):1839-49. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0909-y.

In fact, in cells lacking p53, the absence of Mef abrogates H-Ras(G12V)-induced transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, at least in part due to increased p16 expression.

Cells doubly deficient for Bax and Bak are profoundly resistant to apoptotic stimuli originating from multiple stimuli. Here we describe mice in which Bax and Bak have been deleted specifically in T-cells using Lck-Cre. In these T cell-specific BaxBak-deficient mice, early T-cell progenitors accumulate in the thymus, with relative depletion of more mature T cells. In addition, bone marrow progenitor cells fail to progress to the double positive stage when cultured on OP9 stromal cells expressing the Notch ligand Delta-like 1, consistent with a critical role for Bax and Bak in early T-cell development. Over time, T cell-specific BaxBak-deficient mice progress to an aggressive T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Interestingly, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of BaxBak-deficient T-cell lymphomas does not display amplification of the Notch signal transduction pathway, commonly activated in T-cell leukemia in both mouse and man. Bax and Bak, key regulators of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, are thus required to prevent T-cell malignancy, and for normal T-cell differentiation, regulating early T-cell development at the stage of early T-lineage progenitor cells.","['Biswas, Subhrajit', 'Shi, Qiong', 'Matise, Lauren', 'Cleveland, Susan', 'Dave, Utpal', 'Zinkel, Sandra']","['Biswas S', 'Shi Q', 'Matise L', 'Cleveland S', 'Dave U', 'Zinkel S']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL089403/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL089403-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100902,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Stromal Cells', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/deficiency/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/deficiency/*physiology']",PMC3012541,,2010/09/04 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60205-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-279687 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 9;116(24):5237-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-279687.

Whether this suggestion holds true for all types of cancer has not yet been adequately evaluated. METHODS: We used publicly available databases of cancer incidence, cancer mortality and relative survival to correlate relative survival estimates and 1-(M/I) estimates from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the USA and the Netherlands. We visually examined for which tumour sites 5-year relative survival cannot simply be predicted by the 1-(M/I) and evaluated similarities between countries. RESULTS: Country-specific linear regression analyses show that there is no systematic bias in predicting 5-year relative survival by 1-(M/I) in five countries. There is a small but significant systematic underestimation of survival from prognostically poor tumour sites in two countries. Furthermore, the 1-(M/I) overestimates survival from oral cavity and liver cancer with >10% in at least two of the seven countries. By contrast, the proxy underestimates survival from soft tissue, bone, breast, prostate and oesophageal cancer, multiple myeloma and leukaemia with >10% in at least two of the seven countries. CONCLUSION: The 1-(M/I) is a good approximation of the 5-year relative survival for most but not all tumour sites.","['Asadzadeh Vostakolaei, Fatemeh', 'Karim-Kos, Henrike E', 'Janssen-Heijnen, Maryska L G', 'Visser, Otto', 'Verbeek, Andre L M', 'Kiemeney, Lambertus A L M']","['Asadzadeh Vostakolaei F', 'Karim-Kos HE', 'Janssen-Heijnen ML', 'Visser O', 'Verbeek AL', 'Kiemeney LA']","['Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Health Technology Assessment, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20100902,England,Eur J Public Health,European journal of public health,9204966,,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Databases, Factual', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2010/09/04 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ckq120 [pii]', '10.1093/eurpub/ckq120 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Public Health. 2011 Oct;21(5):573-7. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckq120.

METHODS: Beta-catenin mRNA and protein expressions were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) from 99 CML patients. The expressions of BCR-ABL fusion gene at both the mRNA and protein levels were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 94 patients before and during the one-year treatment with imatinib mesylate at the interval of 3 months, and the relationship between beta-catenin and cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of beta-catenin increased significantly in patients with blast crisis and accelerated phase (P<0.001), but showed no significant difference between normal subjects and CML patients in the chronic phase (P>0.05). The main cytogenetic remission rate was significantly higher in patients who were consistently negative for beta-catenin than in those consistently positive for beta-catenin or those with a positive transformation (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Beta-catenin overexpression in the progression of CML, consistent high level of beta-catenin or a positive transformation may indicate a poor response to imatinib, and early measures should be taken to increase the remission rate.","['Zou, Wai-yi', 'Xu, Duo-rong', 'Su, Chang', 'Chen, Mei', 'Li, Juan', 'Luo, Shao-kai']","['Zou WY', 'Xu DR', 'Su C', 'Chen M', 'Li J', 'Luo SK']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China. waiyizou@medmail.com.cn']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,2010/09/04 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,"Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2010 Aug;30(8):1868-70, 1873.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings have particular relevance in elderly patients and in those patients who may be at high risk for lobectomy because of underlying medical comorbidities. Careful patient selection on the basis of individualized assessment of specific patient and tumor characteristics will aid in selecting the optimal approach. For larger tumors, or when adequate surgical margins are not obtainable, lobectomy should be performed. Currently, active, prospective, randomized studies (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 140503 and American College of Surgeons Oncology Group [ACOSOG] Z4032) will provide critical insights in delineating the efficacy of sublobar resection techniques in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.","['Schuchert, Matthew J', 'Abbas, Ghulam', 'Pennathur, Arjun', 'Nason, Katie S', 'Wilson, David O', 'Luketich, James D', 'Landreneau, Rodney J']","['Schuchert MJ', 'Abbas G', 'Pennathur A', 'Nason KS', 'Wilson DO', 'Luketich JD', 'Landreneau RJ']","['Division of Thoracic and Foregut Surgery, Heart, Lung, and Esophageal Surgery Institute, UPMC Health System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. schuchertmj@upmc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,8917640,,IM,"['Brachytherapy', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Lung/*surgery', 'Lung Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pneumonectomy/instrumentation/*methods', 'Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted/instrumentation/*methods']",,,2010/09/04 06:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-0679(10)00031-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.semtcvs.2010.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2010 Spring;22(1):22-31. doi: 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2010.04.004.,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Factors associated with increased transfusions and the extent of blood product use in umbilical cord blood (UCB) recipients are uncertain. We reviewed blood product use in 229 consecutive adult recipients of allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota: 147 with leukemia, 82 lymphoma or myeloma; 58% received unrelated UCB and 43% sibling donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. Although neutrophil recovery was prompt (UCB median 17, range: 2-45 days, and PBSC 14, range: 3-34 days), only 135 of 229 (59% cumulative incidence) achieved red blood cell (RBC) independence and 157 (69%) achieved platelet independence by 6 months. Time to platelet independence was prolonged in UCB recipients (median UCB 41 versus PBSC 14 days) and in patients who had received a prior transplant (median 48 versus 32 days). Patients who received UCB grafts required more RBC through day 60 post-HCT (mean UCB 7.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-8.9) versus PBSC 5.2 (3.7-6.7) transfusions, P = .04), and more platelet transfusions (mean 25.2 (95% CI 22.1-28.2) versus 12.9 (9.4-16.4), P < .01) compared to PBSC recipients. Patients receiving myeloablative (MA) conditioning required more RBC and platelet transfusions during the first 2 months post-HCT compared to reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) (7.4 versus 6.2, P = .30 for RBC; 23.2 versus 17.5, P = .07 for platelets). Despite prompt neutrophil engraftment, UCB recipients had delayed platelet recovery as well as more prolonged and costly blood product requirements.

We have previously reported that accumulation of the precursor envelope protein gPr80(env) of ts1, a mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected astrocytes, results in ER stress, oxidative stress and cell death, subsequently leading to ts1-mediated neurodegeneration in infected mice. In the present study, we assessed whether treatments that reduce the accumulation of gPr80(env) in the ER of ts1-infected astrocytes provided a protective effect against ER stress and cell death. We show that treatment with phenylbutyric acid (PBA) can prevent the unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress and cell death in cultured ts1-infected astrocytes. The protective effect of PBA is associated with its ability to reduce gPr80(env) accumulation and to increase the expression of proteins involved in protein folding in the ER, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ERp44, rather than by decrease mRNA levels of gPr80(env) or alter the proteasomal degradation process for gPr80(env). In infected mice treated with PBA we also noted a reduction in the severity of the neuropathology in brainstem tissues and a delayed onset of paralysis. These results show that PBA is a potentially effective drug for the treatment of neurodegeneration caused by protein accumulation in cells of the CNS.","['Kuang, Xianghong', 'Hu, Wenhui', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Kuang X', 'Hu W', 'Yan M', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX 78957, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784-139008/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784-139006/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH071583-19/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH071583/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043984-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043984/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100908,England,Neurochem Int,Neurochemistry international,8006959,"['0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Astrocytes/*drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Paralysis/*prevention & control/virology', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Viral Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC3402222,['NIHMS240169'],2010/09/04 06:00,2011/09/08 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0197-0186(10)00265-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuint.2010.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurochem Int. 2010 Dec;57(7):738-48. doi: 10.1016/j.neuint.2010.08.010.

Despite this success, a significant subset of paediatric leukaemia patients either relapse or fail to ever achieve a complete remission. Additionally, some patients necessitate treatment with intensified chemotherapy regimens due to clinical or laboratory findings which identify them as high risk. These patients are unlikely to respond to further minor adjustments to the dosing or timing of administration of the same chemotherapy medications. Many novel targeted therapies for the treatment of childhood ALL provide potential mechanisms to further improve cure rates, and provide the possibility of minimizing toxicity to non-malignant cells, given their specificity to malignant cell phenotypes.

We describe two groups of CLL, showing different kinetics of apoptosis in vitro and distinct ratios between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins: CLL-I displayed low Bcl-x(L) /Bax and Bcl-2/Bax ratio and underwent rapid apoptosis in vitro; CLL-II had high Bcl-x(L) /Bax and Bcl-2/Bax ratio and were resistant to apoptosis for several days. Nurse-like cells, expressing vimentin, CD68 and CD31 were detected mainly in CLL-II cultures. Of note, CD31 cross-linking, obtained with a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), induced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent Akt phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-kBp65 and p52 subunits in both CLL groups, leading to upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) transcription and increased cell survival. Binding to CD31(+) stable transfectants, could also deliver an anti-apoptotic signal in B cells of both CLL-I and CLL-II, increasing the Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) protein content, regardless the expression of CD38. On the other hand, the addition of the F(ab')(2) (that is unable to oligomerize the target molecule) of the anti-CD31 mAb prevented these effects. These data suggest that the CD31 adhesion system may play a role also in vivo in maintaining CLL survival.","['Poggi, Alessandro', 'Prevosto, Claudia', 'Catellani, Silvia', 'Rocco, Ilaria', 'Garuti, Anna', 'Zocchi, Maria R']","['Poggi A', 'Prevosto C', 'Catellani S', 'Rocco I', 'Garuti A', 'Zocchi MR']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Angiogenesis, National Institute for Cancer Research, University of Genoa, Italy. alessandro.poggi@istge.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Heterophile/physiology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2010/09/04 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8343 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08343.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Nov;151(3):252-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08343.x.

The reliability of qPCR data is highly dependent on the use of appropriate reference genes for normalization.

Comparison of familial to sporadic disease additionally identified a copy number variant region near the centromere on 14q, proximal to IGH@, in which gains were associated both with familial CLL, and with mutated IGHV and homozygous deletion of 13q.

For phenotype classification, we propose different lasso logistic regression approaches with specific penalizations for each gene. These methods are based on a generalized soft-threshold (GSoft) estimator. We also show that a recent algorithm for convex optimization, namely, the cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm, provides with a way to solve the optimization problem significantly faster than with other competing methods. Viewing GSoft as an iterative thresholding procedure allows us to get the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimates in a straightforward manner. Results are obtained for simulated and real data. The leukemia and colon datasets are commonly used to evaluate new statistical approaches, so they come in useful to establish comparisons with similar methods. Furthermore, biological meaning is extracted from the leukemia results, and compared with previous studies.

However, the risk/benefit ratios of ATO in hematologic malignancies other than APL are still unclear. In this review, the author attempts to provide current experimental and clinical challenges to gain more knowledge of the effects of ATO by examining combination therapies with other agents, especially for non-APL hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM). The drugs combined with ATO can be roughly classified into (1) signaling inhibitors (imatinib, PD184352, LY294002, 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin: 17-AAG), (2) oxidative stress pathway modulators (ascorbic acid, 2-methoxyestradiol: 2-ME, dl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine: BSO), (3) a chemotherapeutic drug (melphalan) and (4) others (bortezomib, ATRA).

From antiquity Verbascum thapsus has been used as a medicinal herb, it contains diverse polysaccharides, iroid glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, volatile oils and phenylentanoids. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) represents one of the three isoforms that produce nitric oxide using L-arginine as a substrate in response to an increase in superoxide anion activated by NF-kB. It is implicated in different pathophysiological events and its expression increases greatly during an inflammatory process, due to oxidative stress and the activation of the enzymes of the antioxidant network such as SOD, CAT and GPx.In this study an inflammatory state was reproduced by treating THP-1 cells (human myelomonocytic leukaemia) with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and IFN-gamma, obtaining an up-regulation both in the expression and in the activity of iNOS. The aim of the work was to investigate the antiinflammatory action of verbascoside using a concentration of 100 mum. The results show a significant decrease of the expression and activity of iNOS, extracellular O(2) (-) production, SOD, CAT and GPx activity when the cells were treated with verbascoside. Based on these results it is hypothesized that verbascoside has antiinflammatory properties since it reduces the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduces the activity of iNOS.","['Speranza, Lorenza', 'Franceschelli, Sara', 'Pesce, Mirko', 'Reale, Marcella', 'Menghini, Luigi', 'Vinciguerra, Isabella', 'De Lutiis, Maria Anna', 'Felaco, Mario', 'Grilli, Alfredo']","['Speranza L', 'Franceschelli S', 'Pesce M', 'Reale M', 'Menghini L', 'Vinciguerra I', 'De Lutiis MA', 'Felaco M', 'Grilli A']","[""Department of Biomorphology, University 'G. d'Annunzio', Chieti, Italy. l.speranza@unich.it""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '3TGX09BD5B (acteoside)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Phenols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Components, Aerial', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Verbascum/*chemistry']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.3173 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2010 Sep;24(9):1398-404. doi: 10.1002/ptr.3173.,"['Copyright 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also an important mediator of growth and survival in several cancer types, with Notch pathway genes functioning as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in different cancers. However, the clinical role of Notch signal pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. METHODS: To address this problem, we investigated the gene expression levels of Notch signal pathway members (Notch1, Jagged1 and Delta1) in bone marrow mononuclear cells by real-time quantitative PCR in a cohort of 100 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML and normal marrow donors. The prognostic values of the three molecules in AML were also analyzed. RESULTS: Comparing with the normal controls, we show the transcriptional up-regulation of Notch1, Jagged1 and Delta1 in the bone marrow of AML patients with statistic differences (P = 0.008, 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). In addition, univariate analysis of factors associated with relapse-free survival and overall survival showed a significantly shorter survival in the patients with unfavorable karyotype, higher Notch1 expression, higher Jagged1 expression, or higher Delta1 expression. Moreover, Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis of the univariate predictors identified karyotype and gene expression levels of Notch1, Jagged1 and Delta1 as independent prognostic factors for relapse-free survival and overall survival. Furthermore, the prognostic significance of Notch1, Jagged1 and Delta1 expression was more obvious in the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that the activation of Notch pathway may indicate a poor prognosis in AML. Especially, Notch1, Jagged1 and Delta1 expression may be relevant prognostic markers in intermediate risk AML.","['Xu, Xin', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Xu, Maozhong', 'Dai, Qiuxin', 'Meng, Wenjun', 'Yang, Jiangang', 'Qin, Rujuan']","['Xu X', 'Zhao Y', 'Xu M', 'Dai Q', 'Meng W', 'Yang J', 'Qin R']","['The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, 214400 Jiangyin, Jiangsu, Peoples Republic of China. xux.jyh@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100902,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (delta protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2012/08/23 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9667-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28 Suppl 1:S483-9. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9667-0.

However, only a few studies have addressed the question of whether higher CD20 expression parallels with better treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the level of CD20 expression and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) along with the overall response rate (ORR) in B-cell lymphoma patients. The ultimate objective of the study was to determine the cut-off value of CD20 expression together with the predictive significance of better outcome of rituximab treatment. One hundred and fourteen patients with different histological types of B-cell lymphomas treated with rituximab and chemotherapy between 2003 and 2007 were enrolled in the study. All patients had CD20 expression assessed prior to the beginning of treatment. The level of CD20 expression was determined by quantitative flow cytometric measurements, while the OS and DFS were evaluated by means of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The cut-off value of CD20 expression, which predicts a better response to rituximab in patients with B-cell lymphomas, was determined at 25.000 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF). Our data show that patients who achieved complete response after rituximab therapy had a significantly higher expression of the CD20 antigen (p=0.018) than those whose disease only stabilized after rituximab therapy. No significant difference was observed in the response duration between the patients with CD20 antigen expressed above the cut-off value and those expressing CD20 antigen below the cut-off value [hazard ratio (HR), 0.5667; 95%CI, 0.124 to 3.18, p=0.57]. Even though we have proved that patients with a CD20 expression level above the cut-off value treated with rituximab had a significantly longer OS [hazard ratio (HR), 0.4573; 95%CI, 0.1364 to 0.9461, p=0.0383] than patients with a CD20 expression level below the cut-off value. Among our study population, 17.5% had a CD20 expression level below the cut-off value. The highest percentage (80%) of the patients with a CD20 expression level below the cut-off value belonged to the group of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, while the lowest (6.7%) was observed in the follicular lymphoma (FL) patient group. These data indicate that a higher level of CD20 expression correlates with an improved OS in patients treated with rituximab. The cut-off limit of CD20 expression suggested to have the predictive significance of better outcome was in our series set at 25.000 MESF. This cut-off value should be considered when the decision regarding treatment with rituximab is taken. However, these results warrant further studies on larger groups of patients.","['Horvat, Mateja', 'Kloboves Prevodnik, Veronika', 'Lavrencak, Jaka', 'Jezersek Novakovic, Barbara']","['Horvat M', 'Kloboves Prevodnik V', 'Lavrencak J', 'Jezersek Novakovic B']","['Bayer d.o.o., 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2010 Oct;24(4):1101-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) EC9706 cells with Pim-1 siRNA treatment resulted in a clear decrease of Pim-1 levels, followed by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Further, Pim-1 siRNA reduced phosphorylation of Akt and Bad, and increased cleaved caspase-3/-9 activities and expression levels.

Here SCNP was used to characterize Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) disease subtypes based on survival, DNA damage response and apoptosis pathways. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty four diagnostic non-M3 AML samples from patients with known clinical outcome were treated with a panel of myeloid growth factors and cytokines, as well as with apoptosis-inducing agents. Analysis of induced Jak/Stat and PI3K pathway responses in blasts from individual patient samples identified subgroups with distinct signaling profiles that were not seen in the absence of a modulator. In vitro exposure of patient samples to etoposide, a DNA damaging agent, revealed three distinct ""DNA damage response (DDR)/apoptosis"" profiles: 1) AML blasts with a defective DDR and failure to undergo apoptosis; 2) AML blasts with proficient DDR and failure to undergo apoptosis; 3) AML blasts with proficiency in both DDR and apoptosis pathways. Notably, AML samples from clinical responders fell within the ""DDR/apoptosis"" proficient profile and, as well, had low PI3K and Jak/Stat signaling responses. In contrast, samples from clinical non responders had variable signaling profiles often with in vitro apoptotic failure and elevated PI3K pathway activity. Individual patient samples often harbored multiple, distinct, leukemia-associated cell populations identifiable by their surface marker expression, functional performance of signaling pathway in the face of cytokine or growth factor stimulation, as well as their response to apoptosis-inducing agents. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Characterizing and tracking changes in intracellular pathway profiles in cell subpopulations both at baseline and under therapeutic pressure will likely have important clinical applications, potentially informing the selection of beneficial targeted agents, used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy.","['Rosen, David B', 'Putta, Santosh', 'Covey, Todd', 'Huang, Ying-Wen', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Cesano, Alessandra', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Fantl, Wendy J']","['Rosen DB', 'Putta S', 'Covey T', 'Huang YW', 'Nolan GP', 'Cesano A', 'Minden MD', 'Fantl WJ']","['Nodality, Inc, South San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100825,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology']",PMC2928279,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012405 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Aug 25;5(8):e12405. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lytic lesions rarely heal and X-rays are of limited value in monitoring bone destruction during anti-myeloma or anti-resorptive treatment. Biochemical markers of bone resorption (amino- and carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX and CTX, respectively) or CTX generated by matrix metalloproteinases (ICTP)) and bone formation provide information on bone dynamics and reflect disease activity in bone. These markers have been investigated as tools for evaluating the extent of bone disease, risk of skeletal morbidity and response to anti-resorptive treatment in MM. Urinary NTX, serum CTX and serum ICTP are elevated in myeloma patients with osteolytic lesions and correlate with advanced disease stage. Furthermore, urinary NTX and serum ICTP correlate with risk for skeletal complications, disease progression and overall survival. Bone markers have also been used for the early diagnosis of bone lesions. This International Myeloma Working Group report summarizes the existing data for the role of bone markers in assessing the extent of MM bone disease and in monitoring bone turnover during anti-myeloma therapies and provides information on novel markers that may be of particular interest in the near future.","['Terpos, E', 'Dimopoulos, M A', 'Sezer, O', 'Roodman, D', 'Abildgaard, N', 'Vescio, R', 'Tosi, P', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Davies, F', 'Chanan-Khan, A', 'Palumbo, A', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Drake, M T', 'Harousseau, J-L', 'Anderson, K C', 'Durie, B G M']","['Terpos E', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Sezer O', 'Roodman D', 'Abildgaard N', 'Vescio R', 'Tosi P', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Davies F', 'Chanan-Khan A', 'Palumbo A', 'Sonneveld P', 'Drake MT', 'Harousseau JL', 'Anderson KC', 'Durie BG']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens School of Medicine, Alexandra General Hospital, Athens, Greece. eterpos@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100902,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/*metabolism', '*Bone Remodeling', 'Humans', 'International Agencies', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010173 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.173 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1700-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.173.

This raises the possibility that imatinib therapy may not need to be continued indefinitely in some CML patients. Two possible explanations for this observation are (1) CML has been eradicated or (2) residual leukemic cells fail to proliferate despite the absence of ongoing kinase inhibition. We used a highly sensitive patient-specific nested quantitative PCR to look for evidence of genomic BCR-ABL1 DNA in patients who sustained CMR after stopping imatinib therapy. Seven of eight patients who sustained CMR off therapy had BCR-ABL1 DNA detected at least once after stopping imatinib, but none has relapsed (follow-up 12-41 months). BCR-ABL1 DNA levels increased in all of the 10 patients who lost CMR soon after imatinib cessation, whereas serial testing of patients in sustained CMR showed a stable level of BCR-ABL1 DNA. This more sensitive assay for BCR-ABL1 provides evidence that even patients who maintain a CMR after stopping imatinib may harbor residual leukemia. A search for intrinsic or extrinsic (for example, immunological) causes for this drug-free leukemic suppression is now indicated.","['Ross, D M', 'Branford, S', 'Seymour, J F', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Arthur, C', 'Bartley, P A', 'Slader, C', 'Field, C', 'Dang, P', 'Filshie, R J', 'Mills, A K', 'Grigg, A P', 'Melo, J V', 'Hughes, T P']","['Ross DM', 'Branford S', 'Seymour JF', 'Schwarer AP', 'Arthur C', 'Bartley PA', 'Slader C', 'Field C', 'Dang P', 'Filshie RJ', 'Mills AK', 'Grigg AP', 'Melo JV', 'Hughes TP']","['Department of Haematology, Flinders Medical Centre, SA Pathology, Bedford Park, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. david.ross@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100902,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010185 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.185 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1719-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.185.

METHODS: We explored the association between occupational exposure to ethylene oxide and risk of lymphoma in a case-control study, including 2347 lymphoma cases first diagnosed in 1998-2004 and 2463 controls, from 6 European countries. The diagnosis of lymphoma was based on the 2001 World Health Organization Classification of lymphoma. Occupational exposure to ethylene oxide was retrospectively assessed by industrial hygienists and occupational physicians based on detailed self-reported information. We modeled risk of lymphoma with unconditional logistic regression analysis as a function of various exposure measures, adjusting for age, sex, and participating center. RESULTS: Thirty-one cases and 27 controls (1.2% of the total study population) were defined as ever having been exposed to ethylene oxide (odds ratio = 1.3 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7-2.1]).

In this line, imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI), has excellent efficacy in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. It has opened the way to the development of additional TKIs against chronic myeloid leukemia, including nilotinib and dasatinib. TKIs are prescribed for prolonged periods, often in patients with comorbidities. Therefore, they are regularly co-administered along with treatments at risk of drug-drug interactions. This aspect has been partially addressed so far, calling for a comprehensive review of the published data. We review here the available evidence and pharmacologic mechanisms of interactions between imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib and widely prescribed co-medications, including known inhibitors or inducers of cytochromes P450 or drug transporters. Information is mostly available for imatinib mesylate, well introduced in clinical practice. Several pharmacokinetic aspects yet remain insufficiently investigated for these drugs.

Elevated CXCR4 expression confers poor prognosis, whereas inhibition of CXCR4 signaling overcomes stroma-mediated chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we demonstrate that treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (PS) depleted the mRNA and protein levels of CXCR4 in the cultured and primary AML cells. PS-induced acetylation of the heat shock protein (hsp) 90 reduced the chaperone association between CXCR4 and hsp90, directing CXCR4 to degradation by the 20S proteasome. PS treatment also depleted G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3, as well as attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in AML cells, which was not affected by cotreatment with CXCL12. Compared with each agent alone, cotreatment with PS and CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 or FC-131 synergistically induced apoptosis of cultured and primary AML cells. PS and FC-131 exerted more lethal effects on primary AML versus normal CD34(+) bone marrow progenitor cells. These findings support the rationale to test the in vivo efficacy of PS in enhancing the lethal effects of CXCR4 antagonists against AML cells.","['Mandawat, Aditya', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Buckley, Kathleen M', 'Robbins, Kelly', 'Rao, Rekha', 'Balusu, Ramesh', 'Navenot, Jean-Marc', 'Wang, Zi-Xuan', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Chong, Daniel G', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Fujii, Nobutaka', 'Peiper, Stephen C', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Mandawat A', 'Fiskus W', 'Buckley KM', 'Robbins K', 'Rao R', 'Balusu R', 'Navenot JM', 'Wang ZX', 'Ustun C', 'Chong DG', 'Atadja P', 'Fujii N', 'Peiper SC', 'Bhalla K']","['Medical College of Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100901,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (cyclo(tyrosyl-arginyl-arginyl-3-(2-naphthyl)alanyl-glycyl))', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Synergism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Panobinostat', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60213-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-284414 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 9;116(24):5306-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-284414.

Here, we identify leukemiainitiating cells (L-ICs) on the basis of functional assays and prospective isolation and report a role for L-ICs in T-ALL disease and relapse. Long-term proliferation in response to NOTCH1 activating signals in OP9-DL1 coculture system or capacity to initiate leukemia in xenografts by the CD7(+)CD1a(-) subset of primary T-ALL samples was superior to other subsets, refining the identity of T-ALL L-ICs. T-ALL engraftment was improved in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/scid)IL2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice compared with NOD/scid with anti-CD122 treatment (NS122), but both showed changes in leukemia immunophenotype. Clonal analysis of xenografts using the TCRG locus revealed the presence of subclones of T-ALL L-ICs, some of which possess a selective growth advantage and correlated with the capacity of CD7(+)CD1a(+) xenograft cells to engraft secondary NSG mice. Treatment of high-risk T-ALL xenografts eliminated CD1a(+) T-ALL cells, but CD1a(-) cells were resistant and their number was increased. Our results establish that primary CD1a(-) T-ALL cells are functionally distinct from CD1a(+) cells and that the CD7(+)CD1a(-) subset is enriched for L-IC activity that may be involved in mediating disease relapse after therapy.","['Chiu, Priscilla P L', 'Jiang, Hong', 'Dick, John E']","['Chiu PP', 'Jiang H', 'Dick JE']","['Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100901,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/*pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60208-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-292300 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 9;116(24):5268-79. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-292300.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The study was conducted over a period of 8 years, from January 2000 to December 2007, at the Children's Hospital and the Institute of Child Health, Lahore. METHODOLOGY: Suspected patients presenting with fever, pallor, bruises and hepatosplenomegaly and diagnosed as either transient myeloproliferative disorder or congenital leukaemia were studied. The complete blood count, reticulocyte count, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score, liver function tests, karyotyping studies and bone marrow aspiration biopsy were performed in all of those patients. Management and out come was noted. Results were described as frequency percentages. RESULTS: Out of 10,000 patients presenting during this period, 24 patients were diagnosed as either of transient myeloproliferative syndrome or congenital leukaemia. Fifteen of these were diagnosed as patients of TMS and 9 as patients of congenital leukaemia. Down syndrome (DS) was diagnosed in 75% of these patients. TMS patients were put on supportive treatment and recovered spontaneously. One DS patient with congenital leukaemia went into spontaneous remission and 2 of DS patients with congenital leukaemia responded to chemotherapy while rest of them either died or lost to follow-up.

The duplication of the Ph chromosome is a recurring abnormality acquired during disease progression, whereas intrachromosomal amplification of BCR/ABL1 is a rare phenomenon and has been associated with imatinib therapy resistance. Archival bone marrow chromosome suspensions from 19 CML patients known to carry more than 1 copy of BCR/ABL1 and 10 CML cell lines were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization with a panel of probes from 9q34.1-qter to investigate whether they carried two identical copies of the Ph chromosome or, instead, one or both Ph contained cryptic imbalances of some regions. RESULTS: A duplication of the entire Ph chromosome with no further events involving the derivative 22 was found in 12 patients. In contrast, a sideline with either 1 or 2 isochromosomes of the Ph chromosome was identified in 6 patients but none of the cell lines. In one of the patients a translocation between the distal end of one arm of the isoderivative chromosome 22 and a third chromosome was revealed. 2 patients were found to carry marker structures harbouring high copy number gains of BCR/ABL1 fusion along with a variable part of 9q34 region downstream of ABL1 breakpoint, similarly to the markers present in the imatinib resistant cell line K562. We identified the following regions of amplification: 9q34.1 --> q34.2 and 9q34.1 --> qter, with a common minimum amplified region of 682 Kb. One of the patients had 5 BCR/ABL1 positive clones with variable level of 9q34 amplifications on a variety of structures, from an isoderivative 22 to tandem duplications. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that the intrachromosomal genomic amplification of BCR/ABL1 that occurs in some CML patients during disease progression also involves amplification of 9q34 gene-rich sequences downstream of ABL1 breakpoint. The variety of rearrangements identified in this relatively small cohort demonstrates that the Ph chromosome is not a stable structure but prone to further rearrangements during disease progression.","['Virgili, Anna', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P']","['Virgili A', 'Nacheva EP']","['Academic Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK. e.nacheva@ucl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100901,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC2944125,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/09/03 06:01,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-3-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-3-15 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2010 Sep 1;3:15. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-3-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) were cultured and 50 Hz, 1 mT EMF was applied for 4-6 h to cells induced with Staphylococcus aureus or interferon gamma/lipopolysaccharide (IFgamma/LPS). Alterations in nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels, heat shock protein 70 levels (hsp70), cGMP levels, caspase-9 activation, and the growth rate of S. aureus were determined. The growth curve of exposed bacteria was lower than the control. Field application increased NO levels. The increase was more prominent for S. aureus-induced cells and appeared earlier than the increase in cells without field application. However, a slight decrease was observed in iNOS levels. Increased cGMP levels in response to field application were closely correlated with increased NO levels. ELF-EMF alone caused increased hsp70 levels in a time-dependent manner. When cells were induced with S. aureus or IFgamma/LPS, field application produced higher levels of hsp70. ELF-EMF suppressed caspase-9 activation by a small extent. These data confirm that ELF-EMF affects bacterial growth and the response of the immune system to bacterial challenges, suggesting that ELF-EMF could be exploited for beneficial uses.","['Akan, Zafer', 'Aksu, Burak', 'Tulunay, Aysin', 'Bilsel, Serpil', 'Inhan-Garip, Ayse']","['Akan Z', 'Aksu B', 'Tulunay A', 'Bilsel S', 'Inhan-Garip A']","['Department of Biophysics, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology/radiation effects', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology/radiation effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity/*radiation effects', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/*microbiology/*radiation effects', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Staphylococcus aureus/growth & development/*immunology']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/06/09 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2009/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bem.20607 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2010 Dec;31(8):603-12. doi: 10.1002/bem.20607.

CD123 was found to be expressed on the majority of HRS cell populations (59% of 59 CHL lymph nodes examined), rarely on B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) (3 of 3 hairy cell leukemia cases, 3 of 29 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) cases, 1 of 55 large B-cell lymphoma cases, but not on 95 other B-cell NHL examined), and in none of the 16 T-cell NHL cases examined. In reactive lymph nodes, CD123 expression was largely limited to plasmacytoid dendritic cells and rare histiocyte populations that can readily be distinguished from HRS populations.

Decreased VLA-4 (Cd49d/CD29) and CD11a expression and defective adhesion in B-CLL have been previously shown, although there was no substantial data about its importance in immunobiology of B-CLL. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-met, plays a role in adhesion by acting on VLA-4. c-met and VLA-4 share crucial signaling molecules in cell survival. In this study, relationship between expressions of c-met and CD49d, CD11a, and additional common signaling molecules in B-CLL was investigated. METHODS: White blood cells from 24 patients with CLL were studied by flow cytometry and/or western blotting prior to and after culturing with recombinant HGF. HGF level from sera was measured with a bead-based flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: c-metalpha and c-metbeta were expressed on B-CLL cells, while no expression was observed on normal donor CD19+ cells. This increase was inversely correlated with decreased expression of adhesion molecules. Serum level of HGF in B-CLL was found to be increased. In vitro experiments showed that HGF supported survival in B-CLL cells supporting the possible function of HGF/c-met pathway in B-CLL. Furthermore, expressions of critical signaling molecules shared by both VLA-4 and HGF/c-met systems including Bcl-XL, Akt, PI3K, and phospho-bad(136) following HGF stimulations of B-CLL cells have been found to be increased. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of c-met and HGF may bypass the importance of expression of critical adhesion molecules and support survival of B-CLL cells. c-met, being one of the surface tyrosine kinases, may serve as a target for future therapies in B-CLL meriting more attention.","['Eksioglu-Demiralp, Emel', 'Akdeniz, Tuba', 'Bayik, Mahmut']","['Eksioglu-Demiralp E', 'Akdeniz T', 'Bayik M']","['Department of Hematology-Immunology, School of Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey. demiralp@marmara.edu.tr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In order to investigate the effects of secreted soluble factors on embryonic stem cell (ESC) behavior in a diffusion dominant microenvironment, we cultured mouse ESCs (mESCs) in a membrane-based two-chambered micro-bioreactor (MB). To avoid disturbing the cellular environment in the top chamber of the MB, only the culture medium of the bottom chamber was exchanged. Cell growth in the MB after 5 days of culture was similar to that in conventional 6-well plate (6-WP) and membrane-based Transwell insert (TW) cultures, indicating adequate nutrient supply in the MB. However, the cells retained higher expression of pluripotency markers (Oct4, Sox2 and Rex1) and secreted soluble factors (FGF4 and BMP4) in the MB. Inhibition of FGF4 activity in the MB and TW resulted in a similar cellular response. However, in contrast to the TW, inhibition of BMP4 activity revealed that autocrine action of the upregulated BMP4, which acted cooperatively with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), upregulated the pluripotency markers expression in the MB culture. We propose that BMP4 accumulated in the diffusion dominant microenvironment of the MB upregulated its own expression by a positive feedback mechanism-in contrast to the macro-scale culture systems-thereby enhancing the pluripotency of mESCs. The micro-scale culture platform developed in this study enables the investigation of the effects of soluble factors on ESCs in a diffusion dominant microenvironment, and is expected to be used to modulate the ESC fate choices.","['Chowdhury, Mohammad Mahfuz', 'Katsuda, Takeshi', 'Montagne, Kevin', 'Kimura, Hiroshi', 'Kojima, Nobuhiko', 'Akutsu, Hidenori', 'Ochiya, Takahiro', 'Fujii, Teruo', 'Sakai, Yasuyuki']","['Chowdhury MM', 'Katsuda T', 'Montagne K', 'Kimura H', 'Kojima N', 'Akutsu H', 'Ochiya T', 'Fujii T', 'Sakai Y']","['Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. mahfuz@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biomed Microdevices,Biomedical microdevices,100887374,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomimetics', '*Bioreactors', 'Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Culture Media/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Diffusion', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Silicon Dioxide/pharmacology', 'Solubility']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10544-010-9464-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Microdevices. 2010 Dec;12(6):1097-105. doi: 10.1007/s10544-010-9464-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, cancer stem cells such as glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) are often resistant to either radio- or chemotherapy. Therefore, screening and development for novel therapeutic modalities against CSCs has been an important emerging field in cancer research. In this study, we report that a synthetic dl-nordihydroguaiaretic acid compound (dl-NDGA or ""Nordy""), inhibited self-renewal and induced differentiation of GSLCs in vitro and in vivo. We found that Nordy inhibited an enzyme known to be involved in leukemia stem cell and leukemia progression, Alox-5, and attenuated the growth of GSLCs in vitro. Nordy reduced the GSLC pool through a decrease in the CD133(+) population and abrogated clonogenicity. Nordy appeared to exert its effect via astrocytic differentiation by up-regulation of GFAP and down-regulation of stemness related genes, rather than by inducing apoptosis of GSLCs. The growth inhibition of xenografted glioma by Nordy was more long-lasting compared with that of the akylating agent BCNU, which exhibited significant relapse on drug discontinuation resulting from an enrichment of GSLCs. Meanwhile, transient exposure to Nordy reduced tumorigenecity of GSLCs and induced differentiation of the xenografts. Taken together, we have identified Alox-5 as a novel target in GSLCs and its inhibition with Nordy exhibits therapeutic implications through inducing GSLC differentiation.","['Wang, Bin', 'Yu, Shi-cang', 'Jiang, Jian-yong', 'Porter, Gavin Wallace', 'Zhao, Lin-tao', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Tan, Hong', 'Cui, You-hong', 'Qian, Cheng', 'Ping, Yi-fang', 'Bian, Xiu-wu']","['Wang B', 'Yu SC', 'Jiang JY', 'Porter GW', 'Zhao LT', 'Wang Z', 'Tan H', 'Cui YH', 'Qian C', 'Ping YF', 'Bian XW']","['Institute of Pathology and Southwest Cancer Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (nordy)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MELK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Glioma/*pathology', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/*pathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12015-010-9175-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2011 Jun;7(2):458-70. doi: 10.1007/s12015-010-9175-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We experienced three patients with AMKL, one of whom had Down's syndrome, whose blasts at the first visit exhibited both monosomy 7 and a ring/marker chromosome. For one case, precise molecular-cytogenetic techniques revealed that the ring chromosome was derived from a chromosome 7. It was strongly suggested that the ring chromosome was derived from a chromosome 7 in another case. The ring or one of the 2 marker chromosomes was derived from a chromosome 7 in the other case. All patients responded well to initial induction therapy. While it is not clear whether the ring/marker chromosome 7 affects the long-term prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7, it may be of prognostic relevance to distinguish pure monosomy 7 from monosomy 7 with a ring/marker chromosome 7. For this purpose, conventional G-banding could be complemented with additional techniques such as spectral karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization, which characterize the aberration in more detail. These methods may be useful for determining the optimal treatment and for elucidating the etiology of AMKL itself.","['Fujino, Hisanori', 'Fujita, Naoto', 'Hamamoto, Kazuko', 'Oobu, Satoshi', 'Kita, Makoto', 'Tanaka, Atsushi', 'Matsubara, Hiroshi', 'Watanabe, Ken-Ichiro', 'Heike, Toshio', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Fujino H', 'Fujita N', 'Hamamoto K', 'Oobu S', 'Kita M', 'Tanaka A', 'Matsubara H', 'Watanabe K', 'Heike T', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100901,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Monosomy']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0663-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Sep;92(2):386-90. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0663-0.

We evaluated the prognostic value of soluble CD44 and IFN-gamma in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and analyzed their source and regulation secretion in B-CLL clones in vitro. Levels of soluble CD44 standard (sCD44s) and IFN-gamma were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. B-CLL cells were separated and stimulated in vitro for the detection of both markers. Serum levels of sCD44s and IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in patients with B-CLL in comparison with normal persons. Elevated levels of sCD44s and IFN-gamma were associated with an advanced disease as reflected by increased values as stage progress. In B-CLL, sCD44s as well as IFN-gamma was shed from leukemia cells as shown by in vitro cultures. Stimulation of B-CLL clones results in a proliferation-associated increased secretion of sCD44s and IFN-gamma. B-CLL clones from advanced-stage patients are characterized by an increased capacity for proliferation and production of both markers in comparison with early-stage patients. Our present results suggest that sCD44 and IFN-gamma may be of major importance in the pathogenesis of B-CLL, and inhibition of the effects of sCD44 and IFN-gamma could be a potential therapeutic strategy.","['Samy, Nervana', 'Abd El-Maksoud, M D', 'Mousa, T E', 'El-Mezayen, Hatem A', 'Shaalan, Mohamed']","['Samy N', 'Abd El-Maksoud MD', 'Mousa TE', 'El-Mezayen HA', 'Shaalan M']","['Biochemistry Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt. nervana91@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100831,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*blood', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2012/08/23 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9661-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28 Suppl 1:S471-5. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9661-6.

Here we show that the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, MLL2, controls most of the promoter-specific chromatin modification, H3K4me3, during oogenesis and early development. Using conditional knockout mutagenesis and a hypomorph model, we show that Mll2 deficiency in oocytes results in anovulation and oocyte death, with increased transcription of p53, apoptotic factors, and Iap elements. MLL2 is required for (1) bulk H3K4me3 but not H3K4me1, indicating that MLL2 controls most promoters but monomethylation is regulated by a different H3K4 methyltransferase; (2) the global transcriptional silencing that preceeds resumption of meiosis but not for the concomitant nuclear reorganization into the surrounded nucleolus (SN) chromatin configuration; (3) oocyte survival; and (4) normal zygotic genome activation. These results reveal that MLL2 is autonomously required in oocytes for fertility and imply that MLL2 contributes to the epigenetic reprogramming that takes place before fertilization. We propose that once this task has been accomplished, MLL2 is not required until gastrulation and that other methyltransferases are responsible for bulk H3K4me3, thereby revealing an unexpected epigenetic control switch amongst the H3K4 methyltransferases during development.","['Andreu-Vieyra, Claudia V', 'Chen, Ruihong', 'Agno, Julio E', 'Glaser, Stefan', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Matzuk, Martin M']","['Andreu-Vieyra CV', 'Chen R', 'Agno JE', 'Glaser S', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Stewart AF', 'Matzuk MM']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD033438/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD033438/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD33438/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100817,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (Histones)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epigenomics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oocytes/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Oogenesis']",PMC2923083,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pbio.1000453 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Biol. 2010 Aug 17;8(8). doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000453.,,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,

However, further studies to discuss the prognostic value and the relationship of the epigenetic signatures with defined genomic rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia are required. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We carried out high-throughput methylation profiling on 116 de novo AML cases and we validated the significant biomarkers in an independent cohort of 244 AML cases. Methylation signatures were associated with the presence of a specific cytogenetic status. In normal karyotype cases, aberrant methylation of the promoter of DBC1 was validated as a predictor of the disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, DBC1 expression was significantly silenced in the aberrantly methylated samples. Patients with chromosome rearrangements showed distinct methylation signatures. To establish the role of fusion proteins in the epigenetic profiles, 20 additional samples of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced with common fusion genes were studied and compared with patient samples carrying the same rearrangements. The presence of MLL rearrangements in HSPC induced the methylation profile observed in the MLL-positive primary samples. In contrast, fusion genes such as AML1/ETO or CBFB/MYH11 failed to reproduce the epigenetic signature observed in the patients. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides a comprehensive epigenetic profiling of AML, identifies new clinical markers for cases with a normal karyotype, and reveals relevant biological information related to the role of fusion proteins on the methylation signature.","['Alvarez, Sara', 'Suela, Javier', 'Valencia, Ana', 'Fernandez, Agustin', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Martin-Subero, Jose Ignacio', 'Maiques, Alba', 'Acquadro, Francesco', 'Rodriguez Perales, Sandra', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Cigudosa, Juan C']","['Alvarez S', 'Suela J', 'Valencia A', 'Fernandez A', 'Wunderlich M', 'Agirre X', 'Prosper F', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Maiques A', 'Acquadro F', 'Rodriguez Perales S', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Siebert R', 'Mulloy JC', 'Cervera J', 'Sanz MA', 'Esteller M', 'Cigudosa JC']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Centro Nacional Investigaciones Oncologicas, Centro de Investigaciones de Enfermedades Raras, Madrid, Spain. salvarez@cnio.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100816,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",PMC2922373,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012197 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Aug 16;5(8):e12197. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existence of a triple-cross-resistant mutation, T315I, has been a challenging problem, which can be overcome by finding new inhibitors. Many new compounds active against T315I mutants are now at different stages of development. In this paper we develop an algorithm which can weigh different combination treatment protocols according to their cross-resistance properties, and find the protocols with the highest probability of treatment success. This algorithm also takes into account drug toxicity by minimizing the number of drugs used, and their concentration. Although our methodology is based on a stochastic model of CML microevolution, the algorithm itself does not require measurements of any parameters (such as mutation rates, or division/death rates of cells), and can be used by medical professionals without a mathematical background.

After achieving a complete cytogenetic response that was repetitively documented, IFN-alpha treatment was stopped. Despite maintenance of a complete cytogenetic response, a progressive rise of the BCR-ABL1 transcript was detected and loss of major molecular response occurred about 2 years after stopping IFN-alpha therapy. Disease remained at molecular level. INVESTIGATIONS: Peripheral blood quantitative real-time PCR every 3 months and periodical bone marrow aspirate were performed to monitor disease. DIAGNOSIS: Chronic-phase, Philadelphia-positive CML that was still detectable after complete cytogenic response 2 years after cessation of IFN-alpha therapy. MANAGEMENT: The patient was treated with a target immune approach receiving a therapeutic vaccine that consisted of an immunogenic 25-mer b2a2 breakpoint-derived peptide (CMLb2a2-25) with binding properties for several HLA-DR molecules. After nine boosts of vaccine the patient developed an adequate b2a2-25 peptide-specific CD4(+) T-cell response and BCR-ABL1 transcript started to decline in peripheral blood. No hematological or extrahematological effects were documented during therapy. At the last evaluation, 39 months since vaccinations commenced, the patient is in complete molecular response with an undetectable level of BCR-ABL1 transcript both in peripheral blood and in bone marrow and she continues to receive boosts of vaccine every 3 months as the only treatment.","['Bocchia, Monica', 'Defina, Marzia', 'Aprile, Lara', 'Ippoliti, Micaela', 'Crupi, Rosaria', 'Rondoni, Michela', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Lauria, Francesco']","['Bocchia M', 'Defina M', 'Aprile L', 'Ippoliti M', 'Crupi R', 'Rondoni M', 'Gozzetti A', 'Lauria F']","['Hematology and Transplants, University of Siena and AOUS, Viale Bracci 16, 53100 Siena, Italy. bocchia@unisi.it']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

To further augment the efficiency of this strategy, we have developed a delivery method employing a gutted adenovirus encoding an RCR vector (AdRCR); thus, tumor cells transduced with the adenoviral vector transiently become RCR vector producer cells in situ. As expected, high-titer AdRCR achieved significantly higher initial transduction levels in human cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, as compared to the original RCR vector itself. Notably, even at equivalent initial transduction levels, more secondary RCR progeny were produced from AdRCR-transduced cells as compared to RCR-transduced cells, resulting in further acceleration of subsequent RCR replication kinetics. In pre-established tumor models in vivo, prodrug activator gene therapy with high-titer AdRCR could achieve enhanced efficacy compared to RCR alone, in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, AdRCR hybrid vectors offer the advantages of high production titers characteristic of adenovirus and secondary production of RCR in situ, which not only accelerates subsequent vector spread and progressive tumor transduction, but can also significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of RCR-mediated prodrug activator gene therapy.","['Kubo, Shuji', 'Haga, Kazunori', 'Tamamoto, Atsuko', 'Palmer, Donna J', 'Ng, Philip', 'Okamura, Haruki', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Kubo S', 'Haga K', 'Tamamoto A', 'Palmer DJ', 'Ng P', 'Okamura H', 'Kasahara N']","['Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan. s-kubo@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['R01 CA093709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK54280/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA93709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy/*virology', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*methods', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",PMC3017434,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32356-5 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2010.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2011 Jan;19(1):76-82. doi: 10.1038/mt.2010.182.

Within 4 days, bone marrow cells cultured in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in the generation of CD11b(+)Ly6G(lo)Ly6C(+) MDSCs, the majority of which are interleukin-4Ralpha (IL-4Ralpha(+)) and F4/80(+). Such MDSCs potently inhibited in vitro allogeneic T-cell responses. Suppression was dependent on L-arginine depletion by arginase-1 activity. Exogenous IL-13 produced an MDSC subset (MDSC-IL-13) that was more potently suppressive and resulted in arginase-1 up-regulation. Suppression was reversed with an arginase inhibitor or on the addition of excess L-arginine to the culture. Although both MDSCs and MDSC-IL-13 inhibited graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) lethality, MDSC-IL-13 were more effective. MDSC-IL-13 migrated to sites of allopriming. GVHD inhibition was associated with limited donor T-cell proliferation, activation, and proinflammatory cytokine production. GVHD inhibition was reduced when arginase-1-deficient MDSC-IL-13 were used. MDSC-IL-13 did not reduce the graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor T cells. In vivo administration of a pegylated form of human arginase-1 (PEG-arg1) resulted in L-arginine depletion and significant GVHD reduction. MDSC-IL-13 and pegylated form of human arginase-1 represent novel strategies to prevent GVHD that can be clinically translated.","['Highfill, Steven L', 'Rodriguez, Paulo C', 'Zhou, Qing', 'Goetz, Christine A', 'Koehn, Brent H', 'Veenstra, Rachelle', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Munn, David H', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'Ochoa, Augusto C', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Highfill SL', 'Rodriguez PC', 'Zhou Q', 'Goetz CA', 'Koehn BH', 'Veenstra R', 'Taylor PA', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Serody JS', 'Munn DH', 'Tolar J', 'Ochoa AC', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 AI056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR021970-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49997/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI034495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL049997/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR021970/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082689-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107974-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-13)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Eif2ak4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginase/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Disease/enzymology/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-13/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3031417,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60371-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-287839 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 16;116(25):5738-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-287839.

In a small subset, RARA is fused to a different partner, usually involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Here, we identified a novel RARA fusion transcript, BCOR-RARA, in a t(X;17)(p11;q12) variant of APL with unique morphologic features, including rectangular and round cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Although the patient was clinically responsive to all-trans retinoic acid, several relapses occurred with standard chemotherapy and all-trans retinoic acid. BCOR is a transcriptional corepressor through the proto-oncoprotein, BCL6, recruiting histone deacetylases and polycomb repressive complex 1 components. BCOR-RARA was found to possess common features with other RARA fusion proteins. These included: (1) the same break point in RARA cDNA; (2) self-association; (3) retinoid X receptor alpha is necessary for BCOR-RARA to associate with the RARA responsive element; (4) action in a dominant-negative manner on RARA transcriptional activation; and (5) aberrant subcellular relocalization.

We explored the impact of TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1), the most common fusion protein in childhood leukemia, on miRNA expression and the leukemic phenotype. Using RNA interference, miRNA expression arrays, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we identified miRNA-494 and miRNA-320a to be up-regulated upon TEL-AML1 silencing independently of TEL expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis identified miRNA-494 as a direct miRNA target of the fusion protein TEL-AML1. Using bioinformatic analysis as well as functional luciferase experiments, we demonstrate that survivin is a target of the 2 miRNAs. miRNA-494 and miRNA-320a were introduced to the cells by transfection and survivin expression determined by Western blot analysis. These miRNAs blocked survivin expression and resulted in apoptosis in a similar manner as TEL-AML1 silencing by itself; this silencing was also shown to be Dicer-dependent. miRNAs-494 and -320a are expressed at lower levels in TEL-AML1+ leukemias compared with immunophenotype-matched nonTEL-AML1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtypes, and within TEL-AML1+ leukemias their expression is correlated to survivin levels. In summary our data suggest that TEL-AML1 might exert its antiapoptotic action at least in part by suppressing miRNA-494 and miRNA-320a, lowering their expression causing enhanced survivin expression.","['Diakos, Christofer', 'Zhong, Sheng', 'Xiao, Yuanyuan', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Vasconcelos, Gisele M', 'Krapf, Gerd', 'Yeh, Ru-Fang', 'Zheng, Shichun', 'Kang, Michelle', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Diakos C', 'Zhong S', 'Xiao Y', 'Zhou M', 'Vasconcelos GM', 'Krapf G', 'Yeh RF', 'Zheng S', 'Kang M', 'Wiencke JK', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Wiemels JL']","['Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA137829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA137829-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA137829-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03-CA137829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin', 'Transfection']",PMC3265147,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60252-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-206706 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 2;116(23):4885-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-206706.

Although DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are mainly repaired by the DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway in normal mammalian cells, an alternative and less well-defined NHEJ pathway, characterized by microhomology at the repair junctions, play a role in the generation of deletions and translocations leading to cancer progression. Here we report that in FLT3/ITD-expressing cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells from FLT3/ITD knock-in mice, end-joining of DSBs occurs at microhomologous sequences resulting in a high frequency of DNA deletions. Strikingly, levels of Ku proteins, key components of the main NHEJ pathway, are decreased in FLT3/ITD(+) cell lines and murine FLT3/ITD bone marrow mononuclear cells. Concomitantly, levels of DNA ligase IIIalpha, a component of ALT NHEJ, are increased in FLT3/ITD-expressing cells. Cells treated with a FLT3 inhibitor demonstrate decreased DNA ligase IIIalpha and a reduction in DNA deletions, suggesting that FLT3 signaling regulates the pathways by which DSBs are repaired. Thus, therapy to inhibit FLT3/ITD signaling and/or DNA ligase IIIalpha may lead to repair that reduces repair errors and genomic instability.","['Fan, Jinshui', 'Li, Li', 'Small, Donald', 'Rassool, Feyruz']","['Fan J', 'Li L', 'Small D', 'Rassool F']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA070970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA ligase III alpha protein, Xenopus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/analysis', '*DNA Repair', 'Disease Progression', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', '*Inverted Repeat Sequences', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Xenopus Proteins', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3012544,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60212-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-272591 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 9;116(24):5298-305. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-272591.

Furthermore, a synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptide that binds to the CRKL SH2 domain with high affinity blocks association of endogenous CRKL with the p210(BCR-ABL) complex and reduces c-MYC levels in K562 human leukemic cells as well as in mouse hematopoietic cells transformed by p210(BCR-ABL) or the imatinib-resistant mutant T315I.

Human umbilical cord blood cells also express renin, angiotensinogen, and ACE mRNAs. As ACE and other angiotensin peptides function in human haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout haematopoietic ontogeny and adulthood, local RAS could also have a function in HSC plasticity, and the development of haematological neoplastic disorders.

The development of drug resistance, however, is a growing concern for mutant FLT3 inhibitors, such as PKC412. Potential therapeutic benefit can arise from the combination of two structurally diverse inhibitors that target-but bind differently to-the same protein or from two inhibitors with completely different mechanisms of action. Thus, there is a need for identification and development of novel FLT3 inhibitors that have the ability to positively combine with PKC412 or standard chemotherapeutic agents used to treat AML as a way to suppress the development of drug resistance and consequently prolong disease remission. Here, we report the effects of the novel type II ATP-competitive inhibitors, HG-7-85-01 and HG-7-86-01, which potently and selectively target mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity and inhibit the proliferation of cells harboring FLT3-ITD or FLT3 kinase domain point mutants via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. Antileukemic activity of HG-7-85-01 was shown in vivo to be comparable with that observed with PKC412 in a bioluminescence assay using NCr nude mice harboring Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD-luc+ cells. HG-7-85-01 was also observed to override PKC412 resistance. Finally, HG-7-85-01 and HG-7-86-01 synergized with PKC412 and standard chemotherapeutic agents against mutant PKC412-sensitive and some PKC412-resistant, FLT3-positive cells. Thus, we present a structurally novel class of FLT3 inhibitors that warrants consideration for clinical testing against drug-resistant disease in AML patients.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Choi, Hwan Geun', 'Barrett, Rosemary', 'Zhou, Wenjun', 'Zhang, Jianming', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Nelson, Erik A', 'Jiang, Jingrui', 'Moreno, Daisy', 'Stone, Richard', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Fox, Edward', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Choi HG', 'Barrett R', 'Zhou W', 'Zhang J', 'Ray A', 'Nelson EA', 'Jiang J', 'Moreno D', 'Stone R', 'Galinsky I', 'Fox E', 'Adamia S', 'Kung AL', 'Gray NS', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. ellen_weisberg@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA130876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3967795,['NIHMS231513'],2010/09/03 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0232 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0232 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Sep;9(9):2468-77. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0232.

Yet, HIV-1 infects these cells only inefficiently in vitro as compared with CD4+T lymphocytes. Accordingly, we have previously identified a strong post-entry block to HIV-1 replication in MDDC as a result of the cellular restriction factor A3G. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that As(2)O(3), a drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, can fully eliminate the potent post-entry restriction of HIV-1 infection in MDDC and in blood-derived MyDC by mechanisms that were unclear. We are now exploring the interplay between As(2)O(3) and A3G-mediated restriction in primary DC subsets. Here, we report that As(2)O(3) counteracts A3G-mediated restriction in MyDC but not in MDDC. RNAi of A3G in MyDC indicated that the As(2)O(3)-mediated increase of HIV-1 infection was largely dependent on the presence of the cellular restriction factor. This study reveals an unexpected interplay between As(2)O(3) and A3G-mediated restriction to HIV-1 infection in primary human MyDC.","['Stalder, Romaine', 'Blanchet, Fabien', 'Mangeat, Bastien', 'Piguet, Vincent']","['Stalder R', 'Blanchet F', 'Mangeat B', 'Piguet V']","['Departments of Dermatology and Venereology and Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University Hospital and Medical School of Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Alu Elements', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*physiology', 'Dendritic Cells/*virology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cells/*virology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Retroelements', 'Viral Tropism']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0310176 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0310176 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2010 Dec;88(6):1251-8. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0310176.

Others and we have previously reported that TQ acts as agent that triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through either a p53- or p73-dependent pathway. However, the immediate targets recruited upon TQ-induced cytotoxicity have not yet been clearly identified. We therefore asked whether cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) could be involved in TQ-triggered pro-apoptotic reactivity; PDEs are regulators of intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides and therefore can modulate cAMP and cGMP-dependent cell death pathways. Our results showed that TQ specifically repressed PDE1A expression in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cell line. This effect is concomitant with the previously described sequential deregulation of the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p73 and the epigenetic integrator UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, PHD Ring Finger 1). Interestingly, RNA-interference knock-down of PDE1A expression as well as decreased PDE1A expression induced growth inhibition of Jurkat cells, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through an activation of p73 and a repression of UHRF1. Conversely, PDE1A re-expression counteracted the cellular pro-apoptotic effects of TQ in association with a p73 repression and UHRF1 re-expression. Altogether, our results show that TQ induced an initial down-regulation of PDE1A with a subsequent down-regulation of UHRF1 via a p73-dependent mechanism. This study further proposes that PDE1A might be involved in the epigenetic code inheritance by regulating, via p73, the epigenetic integrator UHRF1. Our findings also suggest that a forced inhibition of PDE1A expression might be a new therapeutic strategy for the management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Abusnina, Abdurazzag', 'Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Keravis, Therese', 'Muller, Christian D', 'Fuhrmann, Guy', 'Bronner, Christian', 'Lugnier, Claire']","['Abusnina A', 'Alhosin M', 'Keravis T', 'Muller CD', 'Fuhrmann G', 'Bronner C', 'Lugnier C']","['CNRS UMR 7213 Laboratoire de Biophotonique et Pharmacologie, Universite de Strasbourg, Faculte de Pharmacie, 74 route du Rhin, Illkirch, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100831,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE1A protein, human)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,,2010/09/03 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(10)00242-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2011 Jan;23(1):152-60. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.015.

A limited number of reports suggest that XMRV is intrinsically resistant to many of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection, but is sensitive to a small subset of these inhibitors. In the present study, we used a novel marker transfer assay to directly compare the antiviral drug sensitivities of XMRV and HIV-1 under identical conditions in the same host cell type. RESULTS: We extend the findings of previous studies by showing that, in addition to AZT and tenofovir, XMRV and HIV-1 are equally sensitive to AZddA (3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyadenosine), AZddG (3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine) and adefovir. These results indicate that specific 3'-azido or acyclic nucleoside analog inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) also block XMRV infection with comparable efficacy in vitro. Our data confirm that XMRV is highly resistant to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz and to inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. In addition, we show that the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir are active against XMRV, with EC50 values in the nanomolar range. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that XMRV exhibits a distinct pattern of nucleoside analog susceptibility that correlates with the structure of the pseudosugar moiety and that XMRV is sensitive to a broader range of antiretroviral drugs than has previously been reported. We suggest that the divergent drug sensitivity profiles of XMRV and HIV-1 are partially explained by specific amino acid differences in their respective protease, RT and integrase sequences. Our data provide a basis for choosing specific antiretroviral drugs for clinical studies in XMRV-infected patients.","['Smith, Robert A', 'Gottlieb, Geoffrey S', 'Miller, A Dusty']","['Smith RA', 'Gottlieb GS', 'Miller AD']","['Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, USA. smithra@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 AI27757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI060466/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI47734/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20100831,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Retroviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Viral', 'Gammaretrovirus/*drug effects', 'HIV-1/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",PMC2939604,,2010/09/03 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/09/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-70 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-70 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Aug 31;7:70. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute erythroid leukemia is characterized by a predominant erythroid proliferation, and in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme there are 2 subtypes: erythroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid leukemia) and pure erythroid leukemia. Morphologic findings are most important for establishing the diagnosis. The erythroleukemia subtype, which is most common, is defined as the presence of 50% or more erythroid precursors and 20% or more blasts in the nonerythroid component. The pure erythroid leukemia subtype is composed of 80% or more immature erythroblasts. Although these morphologic criteria appear straightforward, AEL overlaps with other types of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome that are erythroid rich. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update of AEL, including clinical presentation, morphologic features, immunophenotype, and cytogenetic and molecular data. As the erythroleukemia subtype is most common, the literature and this review are biased towards this subtype of AEL. DATA SOURCES: Clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular information were extracted from our review of pertinent literature and a subset of AEL cases in the files of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston) and University of South Alabama (Mobile). CONCLUSIONS: The current WHO criteria for establishing the diagnosis of AEL reduce the frequency of this entity, as cases once classified as the erythroleukemia subtype are now reclassified as other types of AML, particularly AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and therapy-related AML. This reclassification also may have prognostic significance for patients with the erythroleukemia subtype of AEL. In contrast, the current WHO criteria appear to have little impact on the frequency and poor prognosis of patients with the pure erythroid leukemia subtype of AEL. Molecular studies, preferably using high-throughput methods, are needed for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AEL, and for developing diagnostic and prognostic markers.","['Zuo, Zhuang', 'Polski, Jacek M', 'Kasyan, Armen', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Zuo Z', 'Polski JM', 'Kasyan A', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.

AZD6244 was evaluated against two JPA xenografts, BT-35 (wild-type BRAF) and BT-40 (mutant [V600E] BRAF). BT-40 xenografts were highly sensitive to AZD6244, whereas BT-35 xenografts progressed on AZD6244 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: At the dose and schedule of administration used, AZD6244 as a single agent had limited in vitro and in vivo activity against the PPTP tumor panels despite inhibition of MEK1/2 activity. However, AZD6244 was highly active against BT-40 JPA xenografts that harbor constitutively activated BRAF, causing complete regressions.","['Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Lock, Richard', 'Phelps, Doris', 'Kang, Min H', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Maris, John M', 'Billups, Catherine', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Neale G', 'Keir ST', 'Carol H', 'Lock R', 'Phelps D', 'Kang MH', 'Reynolds CP', 'Maris JM', 'Billups C', 'Smith MA']","['A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA. eakolb@nemours.org']",['eng'],"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3004092,['NIHMS218595'],2010/09/02 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22576 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Oct;55(4):668-77. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22576.,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eliminating residual disease potentially is associated with longer remission and overall survival. The authors of this report evaluated the ability of subcutaneous alemtuzumab to treat residual disease. METHODS: Patients in partial remission (PR), nodular PR (nPR), or complete remission (CR) who had disease in bone marrow established by 2-color flow cytometry analysis were enrolled and received alemtuzumab 30 mg subcutaneously 3 times weekly for 4 weeks, and patients had the option to self-administer alemtuzumab. Responders were patients in PR who converted to an nPR or a CR, patients in nPR who converted to a CR, and patients in CR who had no evidence of disease on 2-color flow cytometry analysis after treatment. RESULTS: There were 31 patients enrolled, of whom 29 were evaluable, and there were 23 responders (4 of 4 patients who achieved a CR, 8 of 9 patients who achieved an nPR, and 11 of 16 patients who achieved a PR. Nonresponders had significantly lower plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment. Furthermore, higher plasma alemtuzumab levels at the end of treatment were correlated with a longer response duration. Compared with the results from an historic group that received intravenous alemtuzumab for residual disease, there was a trend toward a higher response rate but a shorter response duration with subcutaneous alemtuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrated that self-administered, subcutaneous alemtuzumab was safe and active for residual disease and that plasma alemtuzumab levels and real-time minimal residual disease evaluation are important endpoints to monitor in future alemtuzumab consolidation trials.","['Wierda, William G', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Gribben, John G', 'Browning, Mary', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Greaves, Andrew W', 'Neuberg, Donna', ""O'Brien, Susan M""]","['Wierda WG', 'Kipps TJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Brown JR', 'Gribben JG', 'Browning M', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Greaves AW', 'Neuberg D', ""O'Brien SM""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

To comprehensively investigate the subtype distribution with the age and sex factors, and temporal changes of subtype proportions, we re-assessed all patients with lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed at a large oncology service in the Republic of Korea from 1989 to 2008 using the World Health Organization classifications. Of the total 5,318 patients, 66.9% had mature B-cell neoplasms, 12.5% had mature T/natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms, 16.4% had precursor lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL), and 4.1% had Hodgkin's lymphoma. The most common subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (30.5%), plasma cell myeloma (14.0%), extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (MALT lymphoma; 12.4%), B-cell ALL/LBL (11.3%), Hodgkin's lymphoma (4.1%), peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (4.0%), T-cell ALL/LBL (3.9%), and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type (3.9%). Most subtypes showed male predominance, with an average M/F ratio of 1.3. Most mature lymphoid neoplasms were diseases of adults (mean age, 53.5 yr), whereas ALL/LBLs were of young individuals (mean age, 20.3 yr). When the relative proportion of subtypes were compared between two decades (1989-1998 vs. 1999-2008), especially MALT lymphoma has increased in proportion, whereas T/NK-cell neoplasms and ALL/LBL have slightly decreased. In summary, the lymphoid neoplasms of Koreans shared some epidemiologic features similar to those of other countries, whereas some subtypes showed distinct features. Although the increase in incidence of lymphoid neoplasms is relatively modest in Korea, recent increase of MALT lymphoma and decrease of T/NK-cell neoplasms and ALL/LBL are interesting findings.","['Yoon, Sun Och', 'Suh, Cheolwon', 'Lee, Dae Ho', 'Chi, Hyun-Sook', 'Park, Chan Jeoung', 'Jang, Seong-Soo', 'Shin, Hai-Rim', 'Park, Bong-Hee', 'Huh, Jooryung']","['Yoon SO', 'Suh C', 'Lee DH', 'Chi HS', 'Park CJ', 'Jang SS', 'Shin HR', 'Park BH', 'Huh J']","['Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 388-1 Poongnap-Dong, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/pathology', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/10/13 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21824 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Oct;85(10):760-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21824.,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we compare the in vitro effects of representatives of 4 major groups of AML fusion oncogenes on primary human CD34+ cells. As expected from their clinical similarities, MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 had very similar effects in vitro. They both caused erythroid hyperplasia and a clear block in erythroid and myeloid maturation. On the other hand, AML1-ETO and PML-RARA had only modest effects on myeloid and erythroid differentiation. All oncogenes except PML-RARA caused a dramatic increase in long-term proliferation and self-renewal. Gene expression profiling revealed two distinct temporal patterns of gene deregulation. Gene deregulation by MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 peaked 3 days after transduction. In contrast, the vast majority of gene deregulation by AML1-ETO and PML-RARA occurred within 6 hours, followed by a dramatic drop in the numbers of deregulated genes. Interestingly, the p53 inhibitor MDM2 was upregulated by AML1-ETO at 6 hours. Nutlin-3, an inhibitor of the interaction between MDM2 and p53, specifically inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of primary human CD34+ cells transduced with AML1-ETO, suggesting that MDM2 upregulation plays a role in cell transformation by AML1-ETO. These data show that differences among AML fusion oncogenes can be recapitulated in vitro using primary human CD34+ cells and that early gene expression profiling in these cells can reveal potential drug targets in AML.","['Abdul-Nabi, Anmaar M', 'Yassin, Enas R', 'Varghese, Nobish', 'Deshmukh, Hrishikesh', 'Yaseen, Nabeel R']","['Abdul-Nabi AM', 'Yassin ER', 'Varghese N', 'Deshmukh H', 'Yaseen NR']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL082549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 HL084179/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA91842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL082549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02HL084179/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100827,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics', 'Time Factors']",PMC2929205,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2009/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012464 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Aug 27;5(8):e12464. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012464.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: A molecular data set based on mutations of the NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA genes and the MLL-PTD provides a prognostically relevant risk stratification that can support the decision pro or con an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first remission. The panel of known molecular markers is continuously increasing, for example, considering the recently described TET2 and IDH1 mutations. The introduction of next generation sequencing will certainly catalyze the molecular characterization of AML. Monitoring of the minimal residual disease load with quantitative real-time PCR can be performed for NPM1 and MLL-PTD-mutated cases.

Yet, many aspects of pathogenesis remain to be ascertained and no effective treatment for curing the disease or preventing major cardiovascular events and progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia exists. The objective of this report is to review recent advances in the field and discuss the potential of novel therapeutic approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery of a specific germline haplotype in JAK2 provided an explanation for the well known phenomenon of familial clustering of MPN. Clinical trials with JAK2 inhibitors, either specific or not, have been initiated and first results are available. However, the expectation that these drugs could selectively target mutant cells and cause a molecular remission, similar to the experience with imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia, has been largely unmet. With the aim to develop common tools for clinicians involved in conventional and experimental therapies, a set of criteria for evaluating response to treatment have been developed.

We review recent studies highlighting the potential for novel and standardized assays to provide independent prognostic information and develop more personalized treatment approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Progress includes establishment of optimized real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) assays for WT1 (commonly overexpressed and a putative therapeutic target) and mutant NPM1 genes. Moreover, sequential MRD monitoring using an internationally standardized PML-RARA RQ-PCR assay has been successfully used to guide molecularly targeted therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). There have also been significant advances in multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) to detect MRD, with introduction of 6-10 color technology and improved understanding of the immunophenotype of leukemic stem cells. SUMMARY: Sensitive MRD detection using MFC and/or RQ-PCR has become feasible in virtually all AML patients. MRD monitoring is now considered a standard of care in APL. Recent studies provide a strong rationale for prospective trials investigating the merits of extending MRD detection to alter therapy and potentially improve outcome in other AML subtypes.","['Grimwade, David', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Freeman, Sylvie']","['Grimwade D', 'Vyas P', 'Freeman S']","[""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, Guy's & St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. david.grimwade@genetics.kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833ed831 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2010 Nov;22(6):656-63. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833ed831.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This infection might be fatal for immunocompromised patients who are at a potentially high risk of developing infectious complications. We investigated the detection rate and features of H1N1 infection in immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Between August 2009 and February 2010, we examined 8,112 subjects, including 390 immunocompromised patients, for H1N1. Swab samples were taken from the nose and throat of the participants. Real-time PCR was performed to identify H1N1 viral genes. RESULTS: Positive results were obtained in 2,953/8,112 (36.4%) subjects and 46/390 (11.8%) immunocompromised patients. H1N1 was identified in 8.7% patients with solid cancer, 12.9% patients with hematologic malignancy, 16.7% patients with chronic renal disease, and 14.5% patients with kidney transplantation. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR was significantly lower (P<0.05) in patients with hematologic malignancy as compared to that in patients with chronic renal disease and control subjects. Four patients died due to respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of H1N1 was significantly lower in immunocompromised patients than in other patients. The Ct value of patients with hematologic malignancy was significantly lower than that of other immunocompromised patients and control subjects.","['Seo, Kwan Yong', 'Lee, Hyun Chul', 'Kim, Yu Kyung', 'Lee, Won Kil', 'Song, Kyung Eun']","['Seo KY', 'Lee HC', 'Kim YK', 'Lee WK', 'Song KE']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.']",['kor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Influenza, Human/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['201008388 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.4.388 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Aug;30(4):388-93. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.4.388.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feasibility of drastically reshaping the genome with a single translocation event also gives this molecular event a powerful capacity to drive evolution. Despite these implications and their role in genome instability, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that promote and accompany these events. Here, at the molecular level, we describe 10 morphologically and physiologically different translocants ensuing from the induction of the same bridge-induced translocation (BIT) event in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have demonstrated that, despite their common origin from the integration of the same linear DNA construct, all 10 translocation mutant strains have different phenotypes and the ability to sporulate and regulate gene expression and morphology. We also provide insights into how heterogeneous phenotypic variations originate from the same initial genomic event. Here we show eight different ways in which yeast cells have dealt with a single initial event inducing translocation. Our results are in agreement with the formation of complex rearrangements and abnormal karyotypes described in many leukemia patients, thus confirming the modellistic value of the yeast BIT system for mammalian cells.","['Rossi, Beatrice', 'Noel, Pawan', 'Bruschi, Carlo V']","['Rossi B', 'Noel P', 'Bruschi CV']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Yeast Molecular Genetics Laboratory, I-34149 Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,United States,Genetics,Genetics,0374636,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chromosomes, Fungal/*genetics', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Gene Dosage/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Microbial Viability', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*genetics/growth & development/physiology', 'Spores, Fungal/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",PMC2975295,,2010/09/02 06:00,2011/02/16 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['genetics.110.120683 [pii]', '10.1534/genetics.110.120683 [doi]']",ppublish,Genetics. 2010 Nov;186(3):775-90. doi: 10.1534/genetics.110.120683.

Cypemycin is an extensively modified linear peptide produced by Streptomyces sp. OH-4156 with potent in vitro activity against mouse leukemia cells. Cypemycin does not contain lanthionine bridges but exhibits some of the structural features of lantibiotics, notably dehydrated threonines (dehydrobutyrines) and a C-terminal S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-D-cysteine. Consequently it was classified as a member of the lantibiotic family of posttranslationally modified peptides. Cypemycin also possesses two L-allo-isoleucine residues and an N-terminal N,N-dimethylalanine, both unique amino acid modifications. We identified and heterologously expressed the cypemycin biosynthetic gene cluster and performed a mutational analysis of each individual gene. We show that even the previously described modifications are carried out by unusual enzymes or via a modification pathway unrelated to lantibiotic biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the widespread occurrence of cypemycin-like gene clusters within the bacterial kingdom and in the Archaea.

Therapeutic strategies aiming for a cure of CML will require full eradication of Ph chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) CML stem cells. Here we used gene-expression profiling to identify IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) as up-regulated in CML CD34(+) cells and also in cord blood CD34(+) cells as a consequence of retroviral BCR/ABL1 expression. To test whether IL1RAP expression distinguishes normal (Ph(-)) and leukemic (Ph(+)) cells within the CML CD34(+)CD38(-) cell compartment, we established a unique protocol for conducting FISH on small numbers of sorted cells. By using this method, we sorted cells directly into drops on slides to investigate their Ph-chromosome status. Interestingly, we found that the CML CD34(+)CD38(-)IL1RAP(+) cells were Ph(+), whereas CML CD34(+)CD38(-)IL1RAP(-) cells were almost exclusively Ph(-). By performing long-term culture-initiating cell assays on the two cell populations, we found that Ph(+) and Ph(-) candidate CML stem cells could be prospectively separated. In addition, by generating an anti-IL1RAP antibody, we provide proof of concept that IL1RAP can be used as a target on CML CD34(+)CD38(-) cells to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This study thus identifies IL1RAP as a unique cell surface biomarker distinguishing Ph(+) from Ph(-) candidate CML stem cells and opens up a previously unexplored avenue for therapy of CML.","['Jaras, Marcus', 'Johnels, Petra', 'Hansen, Nils', 'Agerstam, Helena', 'Tsapogas, Panagiotis', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis', 'Richter, Johan', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Jaras M', 'Johnels P', 'Hansen N', 'Agerstam H', 'Tsapogas P', 'Rissler M', 'Lassen C', 'Olofsson T', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Richter J', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, 22185 Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (IL1RAP protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Separation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism']",PMC2941341,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1004408107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1004408107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 14;107(37):16280-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1004408107.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2004, 844 patients (median age, 48 years; range, 16 to 62 years) with AML were enrolled onto protocol AMLHD98A that included a risk-adapted treatment strategy. High risk was defined by the presence of unfavorable cytogenetics and/or by no response to induction therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-seven (32%) of 844 patients were assigned to the high-risk group. Of these 267 patients, 51 patients (19%) achieved complete remission but had adverse cytogenetics, and 216 patients (81%) had no response to induction therapy. Allogeneic HSCT was actually performed in 162 (61%) of 267 high-risk patients, after a median time of 147 days after diagnosis. Graft sources were as follows: MRD (n = 62), MUD (n = 89), haploidentical donor (n = 10), and cord blood (n = 1). The 5-year overall survival rates were 6.5% (95% CI, 3.1% to 13.6%) for patients (n = 105) not proceeding to HSCT and 25.1% (95% CI, 19.1% to 33.0%; from date of transplantation) for patients (n = 162) receiving HSCT. Multivariable analysis including allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent covariable revealed that allogeneic HSCT significantly improved outcome; there was no difference in outcome between allogeneic HSCT from MRD and MUD. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic HSCT in younger adults with high-risk AML has a significant beneficial impact on outcome, and allogeneic HSCT from MRD and MUD yields similar results.","['Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Mack, Silja', 'Stoppel, Michael', 'Kiraly, Franz', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Hartmann, Frank', 'Horst, Heinz A', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'Petzer, Andreas', 'Grimminger, Wolfgang', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Glasmacher, Axel', 'Salwender, Hans', 'Kirchen, Heinz', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Kremers, Stephan', 'Matzdorff, Axel', 'Benner, Axel', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Schlenk RF', 'Dohner K', 'Mack S', 'Stoppel M', 'Kiraly F', 'Gotze K', 'Hartmann F', 'Horst HA', 'Koller E', 'Petzer A', 'Grimminger W', 'Kobbe G', 'Glasmacher A', 'Salwender H', 'Kirchen H', 'Haase D', 'Kremers S', 'Matzdorff A', 'Benner A', 'Dohner H']","['Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany. richard.schlenk@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Austria', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Germany', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Pedigree', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/11/09 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.6856 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.6856 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Oct 20;28(30):4642-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.6856.

Less understood are exaggerated sterile inflammation and autoimmunity associated with CGD. Impaired recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells resulting in their disintegration may contribute to CGD inflammation. We hypothesized that priming of macrophages (Ms) with IFN-gamma would enhance impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells in CGD. Diverse M populations from CGD (gp91(phox)(-/-)) and wild-type mice, as well as human Ms differentiated from monocytes and promyelocytic leukemia PLB-985 cells (with and without mutation of the gp91(phox)), demonstrated enhanced engulfment of apoptotic cells in response to IFN-gamma priming. Priming with IFN-gamma was also associated with increased uptake of Ig-opsonized targets, latex beads, and fluid phase markers, and it was accompanied by activation of the Rho GTPase Rac. Enhanced Rac activation and phagocytosis following IFN-gamma priming were dependent on NO production via inducible NO synthase and activation of protein kinase G. Notably, endogenous production of TNF-alpha in response to IFN-gamma priming was critically required for inducible NO synthase upregulation, NO production, Rac activation, and enhanced phagocytosis. Treatment of CGD mice with IFN-gamma also enhanced uptake of apoptotic cells by M in vivo via the signaling pathway. Importantly, during acute sterile peritonitis, IFN-gamma treatment reduced excess accumulation of apoptotic neutrophils and enhanced phagocytosis by CGD Ms. These data support the hypothesis that in addition to correcting immunodeficiency in CGD, IFN-gamma priming of Ms restores clearance of apoptotic cells and may thereby contribute to resolution of exaggerated CGD inflammation.","['Fernandez-Boyanapalli, Ruby', 'McPhillips, Kathleen A', 'Frasch, S Courtney', 'Janssen, William J', 'Dinauer, Mary C', 'Riches, David W H', 'Henson, Peter M', 'Byrne, Aideen', 'Bratton, Donna L']","['Fernandez-Boyanapalli R', 'McPhillips KA', 'Frasch SC', 'Janssen WJ', 'Dinauer MC', 'Riches DW', 'Henson PM', 'Byrne A', 'Bratton DL']","['National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL68864/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI058228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL34303/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068864/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI058228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 81151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM61031/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL081151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL034303/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM061031/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI058228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nitric Oxide/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",PMC4346245,['NIHMS665328'],2010/09/02 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1001778 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1001778 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Oct 1;185(7):4030-41. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1001778.

These mutations result in an accumulation of alpha-ketoglutarate to R (2)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). To further clarify the role of this mutation in AML, we have analyzed IDH1R132 in 1414 AML patients. We detected IDH1R132 mutations in 93 of 1414 patients (6.6%) with a clear prevalence in intermediate risk karyotype group (10.4%, P < .001). Although IDH1R132 mutations can incidentally occur together with all other molecular markers, there were strong associations with NPM1 mutations (14.2% vs 5.4% in NPM1wt, P < .001) and MLL-PTD (18.2% vs 7.0% in MLLwt, P = .020). IDH1-mutated cases more often had AML without maturation/French-American-British M1 (P < .001), an immature immunophenotype, and female sex (8.7% vs 4.7% in male, P = .003) compared with IDH1wt cases. Prognosis was adversely affected by IDH1 mutations with trend for shorter overall survival (P = .110), a shorter event-free survival (P < .003) and a higher cumulative risk for relapse (P = .001). IDH1 mutations were of independent prognostic relevance for event-free survival (P = .039) especially in the age group < 60 years (P = .028).

Trib2 has 3 distinct regions, a proline-rich N-terminus, a serine/threonine kinase homology domain, and a C-terminal constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1)-binding domain. We performed a structure-function analysis of Trib2 using in vitro and in vivo assays. The N-terminus was not required for Trib2-induced AML. Deletion or mutation of the COP1-binding site abrogated the ability of Trib2 to degrade CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha), block granulocytic differentiation, and to induce AML in vivo. Furthermore, COP1 knockdown inhibited the ability of Trib2 to degrade C/EBP-alpha, showing that it is important for mediating Trib2 activity. We also show that the Trib2 kinase domain is essential for its function. Trib2 contains variant catalytic loop sequences, compared with conventional kinases, that we show are necessary for Trib2 activity. The kinase domain mutants bind, but cannot efficiently degrade, C/EBP-alpha. Together, our data demonstrate that Trib2 can bind both COP1 and C/EBP-alpha, leading to degradation of C/EBP-alpha. Identification of the functional regions of Trib2 that are essential to its oncogenic role provides the basis for developing inhibitors that will block Trib functions in cancer.","['Keeshan, Karen', 'Bailis, Will', 'Dedhia, Priya H', 'Vega, Maria E', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Toscano, Kristin', 'Uljon, Sacha N', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Keeshan K', 'Bailis W', 'Dedhia PH', 'Vega ME', 'Shestova O', 'Xu L', 'Toscano K', 'Uljon SN', 'Blacklow SC', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Medicine and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R25 GM071745/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA093615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA093615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25GM071745/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (COP1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",PMC3012589,,2010/09/02 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60259-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-247361 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 2;116(23):4948-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-247361.

METHODS: GEP on Illumina arrays compared paired aliquots (cryopreserved or stored in TRIzol) of primary samples of multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Data were analyzed at the ""probe level"" (a single consensus value) or ""bead level"" (multiple measurements provided by individual beads). RESULTS: TRIzol storage does not affect standard probe-level comparisons between sample groups: different preservation methods did not generate differentially expressed probes (DEP) within MM or AML sample groups, or substantially affect the many DEPs distinguishing between these groups. Differences were found by gene set enrichment analysis, but these were dismissible because of instability with permutation of sample labels, unbalanced restriction to TRIzol aliquots, inconsistency between MM and AML groups, and lack of biological plausibility. Bead-level comparisons found many DEPs within sample pairs, but most (73%) were <2-fold changed. There was no consistent evidence that TRIzol causes premature reverse transcription termination. Instead, a subset of DEPs were systematically due to increased signals in TRIzol-preserved samples from probes near the 5' end of transcripts, suggesting better mRNA preservation with TRIzol. CONCLUSIONS: TRIzol preserves RNA quality well, without a deleterious effect on GEP. Samples stored frozen with and without TRIzol may be compared by GEP with only minor concern for systematic artifacts. IMPACT: The standard practice of prolonged sample storage in TRIzol is suitable for GEP.","['Ma, Wencai', 'Wang, Michael', 'Wang, Zhi-Qiang', 'Sun, Luhong', 'Graber, David', 'Matthews, Jairo', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Yi, Qing', 'Orlowski, Robert Z', 'Kwak, Larry W', 'Weber, Donna M', 'Thomas, Sheeba K', 'Shah, Jatin', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Davis, Richard E']","['Ma W', 'Wang M', 'Wang ZQ', 'Sun L', 'Graber D', 'Matthews J', 'Champlin R', 'Yi Q', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Kwak LW', 'Weber DM', 'Thomas SK', 'Shah J', 'Kornblau S', 'Davis RE']","['The Myeloma Tissue and Leukemia Satellite Sample Banks, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77054, USA.']",['eng'],"['2P01 CA55164-05A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100830,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (trizol)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Guanidines/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Phenols/*chemistry', 'RNA/*chemistry/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC2966770,['NIHMS231482'],2010/09/02 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-10-0565 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0565 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Oct;19(10):2445-52. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0565.

We introduced into EpiSCs a Jak/Stat3 activating receptor (GY118F) responsive to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Gcsf). On transfer to ground state culture, in which MAPK signaling and glycogen synthase kinase are inhibited, Gcsf induced transcriptional resetting and functional reprogramming. Activation of a tamoxifen-regulatable fusion, Stat3ER(T2), also converted EpiSCs into chimera-competent iPSCs. We exploited GY118F to increase Jak/Stat3 activity during somatic cell reprogramming.

More clinical studies concerning the prognosis, treatment response, and survival of patients with t(10;17) are necessary.","['Oh, Seung Hwan', 'Park, Tae Sung', 'Cho, Sun Young', 'Kim, Min Jin', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Kim, Bomi', 'Song, Sae Am', 'Lee, Ja Young', 'Jun, Kyung Ran', 'Shin, Jeong Hwan', 'Kim, Hye Ran', 'Lee, Jeong Nyeo']","['Oh SH', 'Park TS', 'Cho SY', 'Kim MJ', 'Huh J', 'Kim B', 'Song SA', 'Lee JY', 'Jun KR', 'Shin JH', 'Kim HR', 'Lee JN']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Inje University College of Medicine, Gaegeum-dong, Busanjin-gu, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00258-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Oct 1;202(1):43-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.06.005.,['2010 Elsevier Inc.

To date, constitutional human neocentromeres have been reported in at least 90 cases. In cancer, however, the knowledge is much more limited. Acquired neocentromeres have been described in a particular class of lipomatous tumors (atypical lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas; ALP-WDLPS), three cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and one case of lung carcinoma. Here, we report on a 66-year-old male with angioimmunoblastic T-cell NHL. Cytogenetic analysis of his bone marrow showed multiple aberrations, including the presence of a supernumerary chromosome. Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique, the supernumerary chromosome was demonstrated to be entirely composed of material derived from chromosome 1. It represented an inverted duplication of the segments between 1q21 and 1qter with a neocentromere in band 1q31. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of NHL (both T-cell) with the presence of a neocentromere. The occurrence of neocentromeres in tumor cells, however, may be underestimated because of technical limitations during the routine diagnostic chromosomal analysis. The prognostic impact is therefore currently unknown.","['Blom, Eric', 'Heyning, Fenna H', 'Kroes, Wilma G M']","['Blom E', 'Heyning FH', 'Kroes WG']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00257-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Oct 1;202(1):38-42. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.06.004.,['2010 Elsevier Inc.

We now show that the enhancement of differentiation becomes apparent with slow kinetics (12-24 h). Interestingly, the inhibition of p38MAPK alpha/beta by their selective inhibitor SB202190 (SB) leads to an upregulated expression of p38MAPK isoforms gamma and delta in 1,25D-treated AML cells, in cell lines and in primary culture. Although the expression and activating phosphorylations of p38MAPK alpha are also increased by an exposure of the cells to SB, its kinase activity is blocked by SB, as shown by reduced levels of phosphorylated Hsp27, a downstream target of p38MAPK alpha. A positive role of p38MAPKs in 1,25D-induced differentiation is shown by the inhibition of differentiation by antisense oligonucleotides to all p38MAPK isoforms. Other principal branches of MAPK pathways showed early (6 h) activation of MEK/ERK by SB, followed by activation of JNK1/2 pathway and enhanced expression and/or activation of PU.1, ATF-2 differentiation-related transcription factors. Taken together with previous reports, the results indicate that 1,25D-induced differentiation is enhanced by the activation of at least three branches of MAPK pathways (ERK1/2; p38MAPK gamma/delta; JNK1/2). This activation may result from the removal of feedback inhibition of an upstream regulator of those pathways, when p38MAPK alpha and beta are inhibited by SB.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Zhang J', 'Harrison JS', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey, Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA-117942-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-44722-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100908,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 12)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 13)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 12/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 13/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",PMC2998239,['NIHMS233186'],2010/09/02 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00404-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2011 Jan 1;317(1):117-30. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.08.010.

Diallyl disulphide (DADS) has potential as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Previous studies have reported that Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (Rac2), a regulatory subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex, is upregulated in DADS-induced apoptosis in human leukaemia HL-60 cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Rac2, NADPH oxidase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in DADS-induced apoptosis. 2. Expression of the Rac2 gene along with that of five other genes of NADPH oxidase subunits were in HL-60 cells measured by Sybergreen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RNA interference was used to test the effect of Rac2. Protein expression was evaluated using western blot analysis and ROS levels were measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence. DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry analysis were used to detect apoptotic cells. 3. Levels of Rac2 gene and protein were significantly upregulated and NADPH oxidase was activated in DADS-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with small interfering (si) RNAs to inhibit Rac2 blocked DADS-induced apoptosis. Diallyl disulphide-induced intracellular ROS production was increased in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated cells, but decreased in Rac2 siRNA-treated cells. In Rac2 siRNA-treated cells, activator protein-1 and caspase 3 levels decreased, c-myc protein levels were increased and p38 protein levels were unchanged compared with Rac2-competent, DADS-treated cells. 4. These results demonstrate that NADPH oxidase is the main source of DADS-induced ROS. In addition, Rac2 selectively activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, but not the p38 pathway, in DADS-induced apoptosis. So, Rac2, NADPH oxidase and ROS have a critical role in DADS-induced apoptosis in human leukaemia HL-60 cells.","['Yi, Lan', 'Ji, Xiao-Xia', 'Tan, Hui', 'Lin, Min', 'Tang, Yi', 'Wen, Ling', 'Ma, Yan-Hua', 'Su, Qi']","['Yi L', 'Ji XX', 'Tan H', 'Lin M', 'Tang Y', 'Wen L', 'Ma YH', 'Su Q']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['CEP5444 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1681.2010.05444.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2010 Dec;37(12):1147-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2010.05444.x.,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Six of the 105 cats (5.7%) displayed clinical signs compatible with feline cutaneous leishmaniosis, and 4 out of these 6 cats (66.7%) were found to have Leishmania infection by means of serology and/or PCR. Leishmania seropositivity was associated with clinical signs of feline cutaneous leishmaniosis (p = 0.029). The prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen was 16.2% (17/105) and of FIV antibody was 20.9% (22/105), with coinfection found in 9.5% (10/105) of the cats. Leishmania ELISA seroreactivity and positive PCR results were statistically associated with FeLV infection and with coinfection of both retroviruses but not with a positive FIV status. The high seroprevalence and molecular rates of Leishmania infection observed indicate that cats are frequently infected with L. infantum, and the association with FeLV suggests a potential role for this retrovirus in feline Leishmania infection in endemic areas.","['Sherry, Kate', 'Miro, Guadalupe', 'Trotta, Michele', 'Miranda, Carmen', 'Montoya, Ana', 'Espinosa, Carmen', 'Ribas, Fernando', 'Furlanello, Tommaso', 'Solano-Gallego, Laia']","['Sherry K', 'Miro G', 'Trotta M', 'Miranda C', 'Montoya A', 'Espinosa C', 'Ribas F', 'Furlanello T', 'Solano-Gallego L']","['Department of Pathology and Infectious Diseases, Royal Veterinary College, University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100830,United States,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",100965525,"['0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (DNA, Protozoan)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/*blood', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/parasitology/virology', 'Cats', 'Coinfection', 'DNA, Protozoan/blood', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/epidemiology/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Islands/epidemiology', 'Leishmania infantum/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/epidemiology/parasitology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/complications/epidemiology/virology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Toxoplasma/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Toxoplasmosis, Animal/complications/epidemiology/parasitology']",,,2010/09/02 06:00,2014/08/07 06:00,['2010/09/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/vbz.2009.0251 [doi]'],ppublish,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2011 Mar;11(3):239-45. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2009.0251.

However, the mechanism by which this complex kills a wide range of tumor cell lines is as yet largely unknown. The difficulty in rationalizing the cytotoxic effects of the LA/OA complex can be due to the fact that the molecular aspects of the interaction between the protein and the fatty acid are still poorly understood, in particular regarding the oligomeric state of the protein and the actual molar ratio of OA over protein in the complex. Here, the effect of LA addition to an OA aqueous solution has been examined by dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy. Upon protein addition, the aggregation state of the rather insoluble OA is dramatically changed, and more water-soluble and smaller aggregates of the fatty acid are formed. A mixture of LA and an excess of OA forms a high molecular weight complex that can be isolated by size-exclusion chromatography and that displays cellular toxicity toward Jurkat cells. On the basis of gel filtration data, cross-linking experiments with glutaraldehyde, and OA titration, we evaluated that the isolated LA/OA complex is given by 4-5 protein molecules that bind 68-85 OA molecules. The protein in the complex adopts a molten globule-like conformation, and it interacts with the fatty acid mostly through its alpha-helical domain, as indicated by circular dichroism measurements and limited proteolysis experiments. Overall, we interpret our and previous data as indicating that the cellular toxicity of a LA/OA complex is due to the effect of a protein moiety in significantly enhancing the water solubility of the cytotoxic OA and, therefore, that the protein/OA complex can serve mainly as a carrier of the toxic fatty acid in a physiological milieu.","['Spolaore, Barbara', 'Pinato, Odra', 'Canton, Marcella', 'Zambonin, Marcello', 'Polverino de Laureto, Patrizia', 'Fontana, Angelo']","['Spolaore B', 'Pinato O', 'Canton M', 'Zambonin M', 'Polverino de Laureto P', 'Fontana A']","['CRIBI Biotechnology Centre, University of Padua,Viale G.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the outcomes of 29 patients with t-APL who were either treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or with standard ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy was performed. RESULTS: Prior therapy included chemotherapy alone, radiation alone, or a combination of the 2 in 19%, 33%, and 47% of patients, respectively. The combination of ATO and ATRA (n = 19) for induction resulted in a similar remission rate compared with ATRA plus chemotherapy (n = 10) (89% vs 70%; P = .35). The median overall survival for the patients treated with ATRA plus ATO was not reached compared with that for patients treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy (161 weeks; P = .79). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of t-APL patients, outcomes with ATO and ATRA appeared to be comparable to anthracycline-containing induction regimens. This combination may be preferable in t-APL patients to avoid any risk of anthracycline-induced toxicities.","['Dayyani, Farshid', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Jones, Dan', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Dayyani F', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pierce S', 'Jones D', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.

PML-NBs are implicated in multiple stress responses, including apoptosis, DNA repair, and p53-dependent growth inhibition. ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) are specialized PML-NBs that include telomere-repeat binding-factor TRF1 and are exclusively in telomerase-negative tumors where telomere length is maintained through alternative (ALT) recombination mechanisms. We compared cell-cycle and p53 responses in ALT-positive cancer cells (U2OS) exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) or the p53 stabilizer Nutlin-3a. Both IR and Nutlin-3a caused growth arrest and comparable induction of p53. However, p21, whose gene p53 activates, displayed biphasic induction following IR and monophasic induction following Nutlin-3a. p53 was recruited to PML-NBs 3-4 days after IR, approximately coincident with the secondary p21 increase. These p53/PML-NBs marked sites of apparently unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), identified by colocalization with phosphorylated histone H2AX. Both Nutlin-3a and IR caused a large increase in APBs that was dependent on p53 and p21 expression. Moreover, p21, and to a lesser extent p53, was recruited to APBs in a fraction of Nutlin-3a-treated cells. These data indicate (1) p53 is recruited to PML-NBs after IR that likely mark unrepaired DSBs, suggesting p53 may either be further activated at these sites and/or function in their repair; (2) p53-p21 pathway activation increases the percentage of APB-positive cells, (3) p21 and p53 are recruited to ALT-associated PML-NBs after Nutlin-3a treatment, suggesting that they may play a previously unrecognized role in telomere maintenance.","['Shen, Hong', 'Maki, Carl G']","['Shen H', 'Maki CG']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Rush University Medical Center, 1750 W Harrison Ave., Jelke Building, Room 1306, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA108843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA137598-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA108843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Telomere', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3613244,['NIHMS376227'],2010/08/31 06:00,2011/03/29 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22852 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Dec 1;111(5):1280-90. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22852.,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fate of any mutant clone will depend on the target cell and on the fitness advantage, if any, that the mutation confers on the cell.

Using a small-scale linkage analysis with markers around the ELANE, CSF3R, CSF3 and GFI1 genes, we were able to determine that the disease segregated with markers around the ELANE gene. We identified a novel mutation in the ELANE gene in all of the affected family members that was not present in any of the healthy family members. The mutation leads to an A28S missense mutation in the mature protein. None of these patients developed leukaemia.

Despite a number of reports asserting that a variety of cytokines, signaling ligands, and small molecules can help in maintaining the pluripotency of ESCs, mammalian feeder cells continue to be broadly accepted as the method of choice for ESC cultures. This appears to be because mammalian feeder cells seem to produce some as-yet-unidentified factor that makes them very effective as feeder cells. In this study, we investigated wild-type p53 inducible phosphatase (Wip1), the knockdown of which increases Wnt inhibitory factor-1 expression, in its feeder functions toward mouse embryonic stem cells, lowering the effect of Wnt, one of key signaling in maintaining stemness of ESCs. For this purpose, Wip1 was stably expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (STO) using retro-viral gene delivery system and then the function as a feeder cell was monitored either with or without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in culture medium. We demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cells grown with Wip1 expressing STO showed higher alkaline phosphatase activity and sustained Oct-4 expression level even under LIF deprivation condition compared to both control and Wip1 phosphatase activity dead mutant expressing STO. These results imply that Wip1 phosphatase activity in feeder cells is important to retain pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells under LIF deprivation conditions. These results indicate that genetically engineered feeder cells such as Wip1 expressing cell lines, are alternative strategy for the optimization of maintenance and expansion of mouse embryonic stem cells.","['Kim, Jin-Ju', 'Lee, Ji-Seon', 'Moon, Bo-Hyun', 'Lee, Mi-Ok', 'Song, Seun-Hyun', 'Li, Henghong', 'Fornace, Albert J', 'Cha, Hyuk-Jin']","['Kim JJ', 'Lee JS', 'Moon BH', 'Lee MO', 'Song SH', 'Li H', 'Fornace AJ', 'Cha HJ']","['Department of Biomedical Science, College of Life Science, CHA University, Pochon, 487-010, Korea. hjcha@cha.ac.kr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100828,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Ppm1d protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-010-0816-y [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2010 Aug;33(8):1253-60. doi: 10.1007/s12272-010-0816-y.

There is still limited insight into the molecular mechanisms that maintain the chemotherapy-resistant phenotype, despite the obvious clinical relevance that such knowledge would have. In this study, we show that the chemotherapy-resistant phenotype of myeloid leukemia cells correlates with activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, whereas in chemosensitive cells, such activation is less pronounced. Importantly, the overexpression of Hh pathway components induces chemoprotection and inhibition of the pathway reverts chemoresistance of Lucena-1 cells, apparently by interfering with P-glycoprotein-dependent drug resistance. Our data thus identify the Hh pathway as an essential component of multidrug resistance (MDR) myeloid leukemia and suggest that targeting the Hh pathway might be an interesting therapeutic avenue for overcoming MDR resistance in myeloid leukemia.","['Queiroz, K C S', 'Ruela-de-Sousa, R R', 'Fuhler, G M', 'Aberson, H L', 'Ferreira, C V', 'Peppelenbosch, M P', 'Spek, C A']","['Queiroz KC', 'Ruela-de-Sousa RR', 'Fuhler GM', 'Aberson HL', 'Ferreira CV', 'Peppelenbosch MP', 'Spek CA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. k.c.desouzaqueiroz@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010375 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.375 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Dec 2;29(48):6314-22. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.375.

Normal memory B cells do not express markers of germinal-center B cells, such as E2A (immunoglobulin enhancer-binding factor E12/E47), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6), or activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). E2A is a transcription factor that induces somatic hypermutations and blocks plasma cell differentiation. In 50 stage-I(E)/II(E1) gastric MALT lymphomas, we confirmed that all cases were BCL6(-)/AID(-), but a subset (50%, 25/50) was E2A(+). As E2A(-) and E2A(+) gastric MALT lymphomas had similar numbers of somatic hypermutations without intraclonal variations, which implied an origin from memory B cells, the expression of E2A was best regarded as a marker of aberrant follicular differentiation. Although the status of somatic hypermutation was not affected by E2A, E2A(+) gastric MALT lymphoma showed less plasmacytoid infiltrates and higher expressions of miRNA-223, a microRNA associated with memory B cells. Clinically, E2A(+) gastric MALT lymphomas were more likely to spread to perigastric lymph nodes and were less responsive to Helicobacter eradication therapy than were E2A(-) gastric MALT lymphomas. Taken together, aberrant E2A expression is a diagnostic feature of a subtype of gastric MALT lymphoma with weaker plasmacytoid infiltrates and stronger miR-223 expression. A prospective study would be necessary to verify the association between E2A expression and a poor response to Helicobacter eradication therapy.","['Liu, Ting-Yun', 'Chen, Shee-Uan', 'Kuo, Sung-Hsin', 'Cheng, Ann-Lii', 'Lin, Chung-Wu']","['Liu TY', 'Chen SU', 'Kuo SH', 'Cheng AL', 'Lin CW']","['Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100827,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytidine Deaminase/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Helicobacter Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Lymph Nodes/*chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*chemistry/genetics/immunology/microbiology/pathology/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Plasma Cells/*chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*chemistry/genetics/immunology/microbiology/pathology/therapy', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2010139 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2010.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Nov;23(11):1507-17. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2010.139.

Acute myeloid leukemia cells can be differentiated into dendritic cells, which have increased immunogenicity and have been proposed as vaccines against leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Leukemic dendritic cells were generated from acute myeloid leukemia cells and used as stimulators in functional assays, including the induction of regulatory T cells. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in leukemic dendritic cells was evaluated at molecular, protein and enzymatic levels. RESULTS: We demonstrate that, after differentiation into dendritic cells, both indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-negative and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-positive acute myeloid leukemia samples show induction and up-regulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene and protein, respectively. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-positive acute myeloid leukemia dendritic cells catabolize tryptophan into kynurenine metabolite and inhibit T-cell proliferation through an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-dependent mechanism. Moreover, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-positive leukemic dendritic cells increase the number of allogeneic and autologous CD4(+)CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells and this effect is completely abrogated by the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-inhibitor, 1-methyl tryptophan. Purified CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells obtained from co-culture with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-positive leukemic dendritic cells act as regulatory T cells as they inhibit naive T-cell proliferation and impair the complete maturation of normal dendritic cells. Importantly, leukemic dendritic cell-induced regulatory T cells are capable of in vitro suppression of a leukemia-specific T cell-mediated immune response, directed against the leukemia-associated antigen, Wilms' tumor protein. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-mediated catabolism as a tolerogenic mechanism exerted by leukemic dendritic cells and have clinical implications for the use of these cells for active immunotherapy of leukemia.","['Curti, Antonio', 'Trabanelli, Sara', 'Onofri, Chiara', 'Aluigi, Michela', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Ocadlikova, Darina', 'Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'De Cristofaro, Raimondo', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Lemoli, Roberto M']","['Curti A', 'Trabanelli S', 'Onofri C', 'Aluigi M', 'Salvestrini V', 'Ocadlikova D', 'Evangelisti C', 'Rutella S', 'De Cristofaro R', 'Ottaviani E', 'Baccarani M', 'Lemoli RM']","['Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences L. & A.

The differentially expressed genes, predominantly with lower expression in subset #4 patients, are involved in important cell regulatory pathways including cell-cycle control, proliferation and immune response, which may partly explain the low-proliferative disease observed in subset #4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel data demonstrate distinct gene expression profiles among patients with stereotyped IGHV4-34 B-cell receptors, providing further evidence for biological differences in the pathogenesis of these subsets and underscoring the functional relevance of subset assignment based on B-cell receptor sequence features.","['Marincevic, Millaray', 'Mansouri, Mahmoud', 'Kanduri, Meena', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Smedby, Karin Ekstrom', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Davi, Fred', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Marincevic M', 'Mansouri M', 'Kanduri M', 'Isaksson A', 'Goransson H', 'Smedby KE', 'Jurlander J', 'Juliusson G', 'Davi F', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100826,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcriptome']",PMC2995565,,2010/08/31 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.028639 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.028639 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Dec;95(12):2072-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.028639.

Rat HSCs were incubated until becoming semi-confluent and adherent to the dish. Undifferentiated mouse ES cells and 4-day EBs were cultured in gelatin-coated or HSC-feeder dishes, then induced hepatocyte-like cells and the remaining undifferentiated ES cells were examined using immunocytochemical and RT-PCR methods. HSCs promoted the differentiation of EBs into hepatocyte-like cells, whereas they inhibited the differentiation of undifferentiated ES cells. Among EB outgrowths cocultured with HSCs, albumin-immunopositive cells were clearly and abundantly observed, while they were faintly and scarcely seen in EB outgrowths without HSCs. mRNA expressions of the hepatocyte-related markers such as albumin, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and cytochrome P4507a1 were clearly detected in EB outgrowths cocultured with HSCs, while they were only weakly detected or undetected in spontaneous EB outgrowths without HSCs. In contrast to the promoted hepatic differentiation of EBs by HSCs, undifferentiated ES cells formed cellular colonies in HSC-feeder dishes that were similar to the colonies of undifferentiated ES cells kept in maintenance medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor. In addition, ES cell colonies were immunopositive for Oct-3/4, markers of an undifferentiated state, and there were few ALB-immunopositive cells in the colonies. Thus, HSCs have contrasting effects on EBs undergoing differentiation and undifferentiated ES cells, i.e., positive and negative modulation, respectively.","['Nishiofuku, Mariko', 'Yoshikawa, Masahide', 'Ouji, Yukiteru', 'Saito, Ko', 'Moriya, Kei', 'Ishizaka, Shigeaki', 'Nishimura, Fumihiko', 'Matsuda, Ryosuke', 'Yamada, Shuichi', 'Fukui, Hiroshi']","['Nishiofuku M', 'Yoshikawa M', 'Ouji Y', 'Saito K', 'Moriya K', 'Ishizaka S', 'Nishimura F', 'Matsuda R', 'Yamada S', 'Fukui H']","['Department of Parasitology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara 634-8521, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,J Biosci Bioeng,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,100888800,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Coculture Techniques', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryoid Bodies/*cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/cytology']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2011/03/29 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1389-1723(10)00258-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biosci Bioeng. 2011 Jan;111(1):71-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.08.005.,"['Copyright (c) 2010 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

To gain further insight into the inhibitory mechanisms by C1 and C2, we examined early intracellular signaling events, Ca(2+) mobilization and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Both C1 and C2 did not affect early intracellular signaling events but exhibited the suppression of intracellular ROS production through NADPH oxidase (NOX) inactivation. From these results, we proposed that the inhibitory effects of C1 and C2 on Ag-stimulated degranulation were mainly due to suppression of intracellular Ca(2+) elevation by suppression of intracellular ROS production through NOX inactivation.

However, the impact of Treg on infectious immunity after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is still unclear. Immunocompetence against opportunistic viral infections depends on the kinetics of T cell recovery after BMT through two distinctive processes, i.e. lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) of mature T cells and generation of T cells through thymopoiesis. METHODS: In this study, we set out to assess the effects of adoptively transferred Treg on T cell regeneration in a homeostatic peripheral T cell expansion model and a thymopoiesis-dependent BMT model, and on murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) clearance and mortality following mCMV challenge. RESULTS: Using lymphopenic Rag-2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice that received a limited number of congenic T cells, we demonstrate that adoptively transferred Treg abrogate LIP of T cells. mCMV challenge resulted in a rapid increase of viral load and death in mice that received Treg, but not in controls. In contrast, following syngeneic T cell-depleted BMT in Rag-2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice, adoptively transferred Treg did not delay T cell reconstitution nor suppressed thymic output and had no effect on viral clearance and survival following mCMV-challenge. CONCLUSION: The effect of Treg on T cell-mediated immunocompetence against mCMV early after BMT depends on the relative contribution of peripheral expansion and thymopoiesis to T cell regeneration.","['Bruinsma, Marieke', 'Wils, Evert-Jan', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Braakman, Eric']","['Bruinsma M', 'Wils EJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Braakman E']","['Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. m.bruinsma.1@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100827,Netherlands,Transpl Immunol,Transplant immunology,9309923,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Muromegalovirus/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Regeneration', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Viral Load', 'Virulence']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0966-3274(10)00109-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trim.2010.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Immunol. 2010 Oct;24(1):9-16. doi: 10.1016/j.trim.2010.08.003.

Upon entering the thymus, these cells undergo progressive commitment and differentiation driven by the thymic stroma and the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR). These processes are disrupted in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). More than 70% of recurring chromosomal rearrangements in T-ALL activate the expression of oncogenic transcription factors, belonging mostly to three families, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), homeobox (HOX), and c-MYB. This prevalence is indicative of their importance in the T lineage, and their dominant mechanisms of transformation. For example, bHLH oncoproteins inhibit E2A and HEB, revealing their tumor suppressor function in the thymus. The induction of T-ALL, nonetheless, requires collaboration with constitutive NOTCH1 signaling and the pre-TCR, as well as loss-of-function mutations for CDKN2A and PTEN. Significantly, NOTCH1, the pre-TCR pathway, and E2A/HEB proteins control critical checkpoints and branchpoints in early thymocyte development whereas several oncogenic transcription factors, HOXA9, c-MYB, SCL, and LYL-1 control HSC self-renewal. Together, these genetic lesions alter key regulatory processes in the cell, favoring self-renewal and subvert the normal control of thymocyte homeostasis.","['Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Hoang, Thu', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Tremblay CS', 'Hoang T', 'Hoang T']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-1173(10)92006-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S1877-1173(10)92006-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci. 2010;92:121-56. doi: 10.1016/S1877-1173(10)92006-1.,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, when and how hematopoietic stem cells acquire their hypoxic state and maintain quiescence has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to understand this process in human hematopoietic stem cells after bone marrow transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human CD34-positive cord blood cells were transplanted into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain knockout mice. Cell cycle and hypoxia assay analyses were performed, to identify changes in the characteristics of human hematopoietic stem cells following transplantation. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to analyze the transcriptional changes accompanying this transition. RESULTS: Engrafted primitive lineage-negative CD34-positive CD38-negative cells acquired hypoxic state and quiescence in the recipient bone marrow between 4 and 8 weeks, and between 8 and 12 weeks after transplantation, respectively. During 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation, changes in the transcription levels of G(0) regulatory factors, such as CCNC and RBL1, and stem cell regulators, such as Flt3, were also seen, which may be related to the characteristic changes in the cell cycle or oxygenation state. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral changes of hematopoietic stem cells in their cell cycle and oxygenation state during and after bone marrow engraftment may provide insights into hematopoietic stem cell regulation, mediating the improvement of clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation protocols and the eradication of leukemia stem cells.","['Shima, Haruko', 'Takubo, Keiyo', 'Tago, Naoko', 'Iwasaki, Hiroko', 'Arai, Fumio', 'Takahashi, Takao', 'Suda, Toshio']","['Shima H', 'Takubo K', 'Tago N', 'Iwasaki H', 'Arai F', 'Takahashi T', 'Suda T']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, The Sakaguchi Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100826,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics', 'Mice', '*Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/analysis']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00368-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Dec;38(12):1231-40. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.08.004.

Forodesine is the most potent of the PNP inhibitors. Its effect appears to be linked to increased 2 -deoxyguanosine levels in plasma, which in turn is converted to 2 -deoxyguanosine triphosphate in target cells and disrupts DNA synthesis. Several preclinical studies have shown forodesine's effect against lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, and these findings have led to several Phase I/II studies in patients with lymphoid neoplasms. Early clinical trials show that forodesine has promise as a single agent for the treatment of relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, and combination therapies might be warranted to improve clinical results.","['Al-Kali, Aref', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Ayoubi, Mohamad', 'Keating, Michael', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Al-Kali A', 'Gandhi V', 'Ayoubi M', 'Keating M', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Purine Nucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidinones/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,,2010/08/31 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/08/31 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/fon.10.83 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2010 Aug;6(8):1211-7. doi: 10.2217/fon.10.83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, visual karyotyping using microscopic images is time-consuming and tedious, which reduces the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. Although many efforts have been made to develop computerized schemes for automated karyotyping, no schemes can get be performed without substantial human intervention. Instead of developing a method to classify all chromosome classes, we develop an automatic scheme to detect abnormal metaphase cells by identifying a specific class of chromosomes (class 22) and prescreen for suspicious chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The scheme includes three steps: (1) iteratively segment randomly distributed individual chromosomes, (2) process segmented chromosomes and compute image features to identify the candidates, and (3) apply an adaptive matching template to identify chromosomes of class 22. An image data set of 451 metaphase cells extracted from bone marrow specimens of 30 positive and 30 negative cases for CML is selected to test the scheme's performance. The overall case-based classification accuracy is 93.3% (100% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity).

To mimic a TBI procedure, we modified the Jones model of bone marrow radiation cell kinetics by adding mutant and cancerous cell compartments. The modified Jones model is mathematically described by a set of n + 4 differential equations, where n is the number of mutations before a normal cell becomes a cancerous cell. Assuming a standard TBI radiotherapy treatment with a total dose of 1320 cGy fractionated over four days, two cases were considered. In the first, repopulation and sub-lethal repair in the different cell populations were not taken into account (model I). In this case, the proposed modified Jones model could be solved in a closed form. In the second, repopulation and sub-lethal repair were considered, and thus, we found that the modified Jones model could only be solved numerically (model II). After a numerical and graphical analysis, we concluded that the expected results of TBI treatment can be mimicked using model I. Model II can also be used, provided the cancer repopulation factor is less than the normal cell repopulation factor. However, model I has fewer free parameters compared to model II. In either case, our results are in agreement that the standard dose fractionated over four days, with two irradiations each day, provides the needed conditioning treatment prior to bone marrow transplant.

The oncogenic kinase inhibitor sorafenib can significantly prolong median survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the response is disease-stabilizing and cytostatic rather than one of tumor regression. Bcl-xL (B cell lymphoma extra large), an antiapoptotic member of the B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family, is frequently overexpressed in HCC. Here, we present in vivo evidence that Bcl-xL overexpression is directly linked to the rapid growth of solid tumors. We also examined whether ABT-737, a small molecule that specifically inhibits Bcl-xL but not myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), could control HCC progression, especially when used with sorafenib. Administration of ABT-737, even at an in vivo effective dose, failed to suppress Huh7 xenograft tumors in mice. ABT-737 caused the levels of Mcl-1 expression to rapidly increase by protein stabilization. This appeared to be related to resistance to ABT-737, because decreasing Mcl-1 expression levels to the baseline by a small interfering RNA-mediated strategy made hepatoma cells sensitive to this agent. Importantly, administration of ABT-737 to Mcl-1 knockout mice induced severe liver apoptosis, suggesting that tumor-specific inhibition of Mcl-1 is required for therapeutic purposes. Sorafenib transcriptionally down-regulated Mcl-1 expression specifically in tumor cells and abolished Mcl-1 up-regulation induced by ABT-737. Sorafenib, not alone but in combination with ABT-737, efficiently induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells. This combination also led to stronger suppression of xenograft tumors than sorafenib alone. CONCLUSION: Bcl-xL inactivation by ABT-737 in combination with sorafenib was found to be safe and effective for anti-HCC therapy in preclinical models. Direct activation of the apoptosis machinery seems to unlock the antitumor potential of oncogenic kinase inhibitors and may produce durable clinical responses against HCC.","['Hikita, Hayato', 'Takehara, Tetsuo', 'Shimizu, Satoshi', 'Kodama, Takahiro', 'Shigekawa, Minoru', 'Iwase, Kyoko', 'Hosui, Atsushi', 'Miyagi, Takuya', 'Tatsumi, Tomohide', 'Ishida, Hisashi', 'Li, Wei', 'Kanto, Tatsuya', 'Hiramatsu, Naoki', 'Hayashi, Norio']","['Hikita H', 'Takehara T', 'Shimizu S', 'Kodama T', 'Shigekawa M', 'Iwase K', 'Hosui A', 'Miyagi T', 'Tatsumi T', 'Ishida H', 'Li W', 'Kanto T', 'Hiramatsu N', 'Hayashi N']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2010/08/28 06:00,2010/10/19 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.23836 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2010 Oct;52(4):1310-21. doi: 10.1002/hep.23836.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is used clinically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, and also to inhibit proliferation of several solid tumors including hepatoma, esophageal, and gastric cancer in vitro. Here we found that As2O3 inhibited cell viability of a mesothelioma cell line, NCI-H2052. As2O3 induced apoptosis of NCI-H2052 cells, which was accompanied by activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and caspase-3. zVAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, inhibited As2O3-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-3, but not that of JNK1/2 and ERK1/2. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting JNK1/2 suppressed As2O3-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, indicating that JNK1/2 regulate As2O3-induced apoptosis though caspase cascade. Furthermore, JNK1 siRNA abrogated As2O3-induced JNK2 phosphorylation and JNK2 siRNA abrogated As2O3-induced JNK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that JNK1 and JNK2 interact with each other. Moreover, JNK1 siRNA, but not JNK2 siRNA, abrogated As2O3-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. JNK2 siRNA together with PD98059, a specific MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, suppressed As2O3-induced apoptosis more significantly than JNK2 siRNA alone. These results indicated that As2O3 induces apoptosis of NCI-H2052 cells mainly through JNK1/2 activation, and that ERK1/2 is involved in As2O3-induced apoptosis when JNK1/2 are inactivated.","['Eguchi, Ryoji', 'Fujimori, Yoshihiro', 'Takeda, Hiromi', 'Tabata, Chiharu', 'Ohta, Toshiro', 'Kuribayashi, Kouzo', 'Fukuoka, Kazuya', 'Nakano, Takashi']","['Eguchi R', 'Fujimori Y', 'Takeda H', 'Tabata C', 'Ohta T', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Fukuoka K', 'Nakano T']","['Department of Thoracic Oncology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mesothelioma/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/28 06:00,2011/01/29 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22397 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Mar;226(3):762-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22397.,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we propose two forms of weighted Kaplan-Meier (WKM) estimators based on inverse-probability weighting-one with fixed weights and the other with time-dependent weights. We compare their properties with that of the standard Kaplan-Meier (SKM) estimator, marginal mean model-based (MM) estimator and weighted risk set (WRS) estimator. Simulation study reveals that both forms of weighted Kaplan-Meier estimators are asymptotically unbiased, and provide coverage rates similar to that of MM and WRS estimators. The SKM estimator, however, is biased when the second randomization rates are not the same for the responders and non-responders to initial treatment.

With progression of CML disease especially in blast crisis stage, cells from CML patients become resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM) and other TKIs, resulting in relapse. Because Bcr-Abl is known to drive multiple signaling pathways, the study of the regulation of stability of Bcr-Abl in IM-resistant CML cells is a critical issue as a possible therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that a new dual-kinase chemical inhibitor, ON044580, induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl+ IM-sensitive, IM-resistant cells, including the gatekeeper Bcr-Abl mutant, T315I, and also cells from blast crisis patients. In addition, IM-resistant K562-R cells, cells from blast crisis CML patients, and all IM-resistant cell lines tested had reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar in the presence of 0.5 microM ON044580. In in vitro kinase assays, ON044580 inhibited the recombinant Jak2 and Abl kinase activities when the respective Jak2 and Abl peptides were used as substrates. Incubation of the Bcr-Abl+ cells with ON044580 rapidly reduced the levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also reduced the expression of HSP90 and its client protein levels. Lysates of Bcr-Abl+ cell lines were found to contain a large signaling network complex composed of Bcr-Abl, Jak2, HSP90, and its client proteins as detected by a gel filtration column chromatography, which was rapidly disrupted by ON044580. Therefore, targeting Jak2 and Bcr-Abl kinases is an effective way to destabilize Bcr-Abl and its network complex, which leads to the onset of apoptosis in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant Bcr-Abl+ cells. This inhibitory strategy has potential to manage all types of drug-resistant CML cells, especially at the terminal blast crisis stage of CML, where TKIs are not clinically useful.","['Samanta, Ajoy K', 'Chakraborty, Sandip N', 'Wang, Yan', 'Schlette, Ellen', 'Reddy, E Premkumar', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B']","['Samanta AK', 'Chakraborty SN', 'Wang Y', 'Schlette E', 'Reddy EP', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.

We presently evaluated the role of the myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, in beta-cells following exposure to well-defined beta-cell death effectors, for example, pro-inflammatory cytokines, palmitate and chemical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors. All cytotoxic stresses rapidly and preferentially decreased Mcl-1 protein expression as compared with the late effect observed on the other antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. This was due to ER stress-mediated inhibition of translation through eIF2alpha phosphorylation for palmitate and ER stressors and through the combined action of translation inhibition and JNK activation for cytokines. Knocking down Mcl-1 using small interference RNAs increased apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage induced by cytokines, palmitate or thapsigargin, whereas Mcl-1 overexpression partly prevented Bax translocation to the mitochondria, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis induced by the beta-cell death effectors. Altogether, our data suggest that Mcl-1 downregulation is a crucial event leading to beta-cell apoptosis and provide new insights into the mechanisms linking ER stress and the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Mcl-1 is therefore an attractive target for the design of new strategies in the treatment of diabetes.","['Allagnat, F', 'Cunha, D', 'Moore, F', 'Vanderwinden, J M', 'Eizirik, D L', 'Cardozo, A K']","['Allagnat F', 'Cunha D', 'Moore F', 'Vanderwinden JM', 'Eizirik DL', 'Cardozo AK']","['Laboratoire de Medecine Experimentale, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Route de Lennik 808, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100827,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Palmitates/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3131897,,2010/08/28 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2010105 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2010.105 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2011 Feb;18(2):328-37. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2010.105.

METHODS: We performed an updated meta-analysis focusing on high-exposure groups and myeloid leukemia and included two large recent studies: one involving >25,000 workers in US formaldehyde industries and the other involving a cohort of >13,000 funeral directors and embalmers. RESULTS: Formaldehyde was associated with increased risks of leukemia (relative risk = 1.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.11 to 2.21; P = 0.005; 14 studies), specifically myeloid leukemia (relative risk = 2.47; 95% confidence interval = 1.42 to 4.27; P = 0.001; 4 studies).

It has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antiviral, and immune-stimulant properties. Furthermore, it has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the Burkitt p53-mutated Ramos cell line, the mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) line Granta, the follicular lymphoma (FL) cell line HF-1, and the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell line SUDHL4, as well as primary cells from patients with FL, DLBCL, and MCL. RESULTS: We found that andrographolide resulted in dose- and time-dependent cell death as measured by MTT. Andrographolide significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in all cell lines. To determine mechanism of cell death, we measured apoptosis by Annexin V/propidium iodide in the presence and absence of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), the glutathione (GSH)-depleting agent buthionine sulfoxamine (BSO), or caspase inhibitors. We found that apoptosis was greatly enhanced by BSO, blocked by NAC, and accompanied by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. We measured BAX conformational change and mitochondrial membrane potential, and using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) Bax/Bak double knockouts (MEF(Bax-/-/Bak-/-)), we found that apoptosis was mediated through mitochondrial pathways, but dependent on caspases in both cell lines and patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: Andrographolide caused ROS-dependent apoptosis in lymphoma cell lines and in primary tumor samples, which was enhanced by depletion of GSH and inhibited by NAC or the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Further studies of diterpenoid lactones in lymphoma are warranted.","['Yang, Shuo', 'Evens, Andrew M', 'Prachand, Sheila', 'Singh, Amareshwar T K', 'Bhalla, Savita', 'David, Kevin', 'Gordon, Leo I']","['Yang S', 'Evens AM', 'Prachand S', 'Singh AT', 'Bhalla S', 'David K', 'Gordon LI']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

A recent study identified DNA from a xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 68 of 101 patients (67%) by nested PCR, as compared with 8 of 218 (3.7%) healthy controls. However, four subsequent reports failed to detect any murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus gene sequences in blood of CFS patients. We examined 41 PBMC-derived DNA samples from 37 patients meeting accepted diagnostic criteria for CFS and found MLV-like virus gag gene sequences in 32 of 37 (86.5%) compared with only 3 of 44 (6.8%) healthy volunteer blood donors. No evidence of mouse DNA contamination was detected in the PCR assay system or the clinical samples. Seven of 8 gag-positive patients tested again positive in a sample obtained nearly 15 y later. In contrast to the reported findings of near-genetic identity of all XMRVs, we identified a genetically diverse group of MLV-related viruses. The gag and env sequences from CFS patients were more closely related to those of polytropic mouse endogenous retroviruses than to those of XMRVs and were even less closely related to those of ecotropic MLVs. Further studies are needed to determine whether the same strong association with MLV-related viruses is found in other groups of patients with CFS, whether these viruses play a causative role in the development of CFS, and whether they represent a threat to the blood supply.","['Lo, Shyh-Ching', 'Pripuzova, Natalia', 'Li, Bingjie', 'Komaroff, Anthony L', 'Hung, Guo-Chiuan', 'Wang, Richard', 'Alter, Harvey J']","['Lo SC', 'Pripuzova N', 'Li B', 'Komaroff AL', 'Hung GC', 'Wang R', 'Alter HJ']","['Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. shyhching.lo@FDA.hhs.gov']",['eng'],"['R01-A127314/PHS HHS/United States', 'U01-A132246/PHS HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20100823,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/genetics/*virology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC2936598,,2010/08/28 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1006901107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1006901107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Sep 7;107(36):15874-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1006901107.

In the reporting of results of studies, greater attention should be paid to the extent to which exposure assessments require extrapolation outside the timeframe for which exposure measurements are available. We propose a simple graphical method that can be used to visualise the temporal coverage of exposure history with exposure measurements and the extent of temporal extrapolation needed. METHODS: We construct a graph that displays the accumulated work history years for which exposure had to be assessed in each calendar year. Years for which exposure measurements were available are shaded. The proportion of work history years covered by exposure measurements and the proportion of work history years accrued before the first measurements are summarised. When available, the actual number of measurements available in each calendar year is shown. RESULTS: We demonstrate the application of the graphical tool in three nested case-control studies that reported on leukaemia in relation to low-level benzene exposures in the petroleum industry. Considerable differences in temporal coverage between the studies were illustrated, which may have resulted in differences in the reliability of the retrospective exposure estimates derived for these studies. CONCLUSION: We introduce a graphical tool for visualising the temporal coverage by available exposure measurement data in epidemiological studies and encourage others to use similar graphs to derive and share better qualitative insights into the uncertainty in exposure assessment.","['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Fransman, Wouter', 'Miller, Brian', 'Burstyn, Igor', 'Heederik, Dick', 'Hurley, Fintan', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Kromhout, Hans']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Fransman W', 'Miller B', 'Burstyn I', 'Heederik D', 'Hurley F', 'Vermeulen R', 'Kromhout H']","['Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Division Environmental Epidemiology, Utrecht University, 3508 TD, Utrecht, The Netherlands. j.j.vlaanderen@uu.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Australia/epidemiology', 'Benzene/analysis/toxicity', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Computer Graphics', 'Employment/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Petroleum', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,,2010/08/28 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['67/9/636 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2009.053421 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2010 Sep;67(9):636-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.2009.053421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods A retrospective cohort study of workers from six PVC factories in Taiwan was conducted. 3336 male PVC workers were enrolled and further linked with the National Mortality Registry and National Household Registry databases. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) with 95% CIs were calculated and compared to the general Taiwanese male population. Cause-specific mortality between two study periods, 1980-1997 and 1998-2007, was compared. Six-year moving averages of the SMRs were calculated to examine mortality trends. RESULTS: Liver cancer mortality increased during 1989-1994 (SMR 1.90, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.25), reached a peak during 1991-1996 (SMR 2.31, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.61) and became non-significant during 1994-1999 (SMR 1.42, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.34). Leukaemia mortality significantly increased during 1984-1989 (SMR 6.06, 95% CI 1.24 to 17.53), reached a peak during 1985-1990 (SMR 7.56, 95% CI 2.06 to 19.35) and became non-significant during 1991-1996 (SMR 3.24, 95% CI 0.39 to 11.69). The mortality trend for haemolymphopoietic cancer showed a similar pattern to that of leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: VCM may increase the risk of liver cancer and leukaemia. When VCM exposure was controlled at worksites, mortality from these cancers returned to background levels.","['Hsieh, Hui-I', 'Chen, Pau-Chung', 'Wong, Ruey-Hong', 'Du, Chung-Li', 'Chang, Yu-Yin', 'Wang, Jung-Der', 'Cheng, Tsun-Jen']","['Hsieh HI', 'Chen PC', 'Wong RH', 'Du CL', 'Chang YY', 'Wang JD', 'Cheng TJ']","['Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, No. 17 Xu-Zhou Road, Zhongzheng District, Taipei 10055, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100826,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['9002-86-2 (Polyvinyl Chloride)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Polyvinyl Chloride/*toxicity', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/28 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['oem.2010.056978 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2010.056978 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2011 Feb;68(2):120-5. doi: 10.1136/oem.2010.056978.

We examined whether JS-K, an NO-donating prodrug, modulates the Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF-4 signaling pathway in Jurkat T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells. JS-K inhibited Jurkat T cell growth in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The IC(50)s for cell growth inhibition were 14+/-0.7 and 9+/-1.2muM at 24 and 48h, respectively. Treatment of the cells with JS-K for 24h, caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis from 16+/-3.3% at 10muM to 74.8+/-2% at 100muM and a decrease in proliferation. This growth inhibition was also due, in part, to alterations in the different phases of the cell cycle. JS-K exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity as measured by LDH release at 24h. However, between 2 and 8h, LDH release was less than 20% for any indicated JS-K concentration. The beta-catenin/TCF-4 transcriptional inhibitory activity was reduced by 32+/-8, 63+/-5, and 93+/-2% at 2, 10, and 25muM JS-K, respectively, based on luciferase reporter assays. JS-K reduced nuclear beta-catenin and cyclin D1 protein levels, but cytosolic beta-catenin expression did not change. Based on a time-course assay of S-nitrosylation of proteins by a biotin switch assay, S-nitrsolyation of nuclear beta-catenin was determined to precede its degradation. A comparison of the S-nitrosylated nuclear beta-catenin to the total nuclear beta-catenin showed that beta-catenin protein levels were degraded at 24h, while S-nitrosylation of beta-catenin occurred earlier at 0-6h. The NO scavenger PTIO abrogated the JS-K mediated degradation of beta-catenin demonstrating the need for NO.","['Nath, Niharika', 'Chattopadhyay, Mitali', 'Pospishil, Liliya', 'Cieciura, Lucyna Z', 'Goswami, Satindra', 'Kodela, Ravinder', 'Saavedra, Joseph E', 'Keefer, Larry K', 'Kashfi, Khosrow']","['Nath N', 'Chattopadhyay M', 'Pospishil L', 'Cieciura LZ', 'Goswami S', 'Kodela R', 'Saavedra JE', 'Keefer LK', 'Kashfi K']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical School, 138th Street and Convent Avenue, New York, NY 10031, United States.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC005673/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100824,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '0 (O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)', '1-((4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (TCF4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Azo Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism/physiology', 'Nitroso Compounds/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor 4', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/physiology', 'beta Catenin/*physiology']",PMC6959133,['NIHMS1065886'],2010/08/28 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00620-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Dec 1;80(11):1641-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.08.011.

The standard treatment of APL has been based on the combined administration of all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy including anthracyclins and cytarabine. However, 10-20% of patients relapse, with their disease becoming resistant to conventional treatment. Recently the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) or Trisenox for the treatment of APL, based on clinical studies showing a complete remission, especially in relapsed patients. In a recently published study we demonstrated that ATO pharmacology as an anti-cancer drug is associated with its cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human leukemia cells. METHODS: In the present study, we further investigated the apoptotic mechanisms of ATO toxicity using the HL-60 cell line as a test model. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry analysis of phosphatidylserine externalization (Annexin V assay) and caspase 3 activity, and by DNA laddering assay. RESULTS: Flow cytometry data showed a strong dose-response relationship between ATO exposure and Annexin-V positive HL-60 cells. Similarly, a statistically significant and dose-dependent increase (p <0.05) was recorded with regard to caspase 3 activity in HL60 cells undergoing late apoptosis. These results were confirmed by data of DNA laddering assay showing a clear evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in ATO-treated cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our research demonstrated that ATO represents an apoptosis-inducing agent and its apoptotic mechanisms involve phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase 3 activation and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation.","['Yedjou, Clement', 'Tchounwou, Paul', 'Jenkins, John', 'McMurray, Robert']","['Yedjou C', 'Tchounwou P', 'Jenkins J', 'McMurray R']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18540, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.']",['eng'],['5G12RR013459-12/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100826,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism']",PMC2939535,,2010/08/28 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-3-28 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-3-28 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2010 Aug 26;3:28. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-3-28.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work ten synthetic chalcones derived from 2-naphtaldehyde were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect in murine acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells L-1210. METHODS: A series of ten chalcones derived from 2-naphtaldehyde and corresponding acetophenones were prepared by aldolic condensation, using methanol as solvent under basic conditions, at room temperature for 24 h. The cell viability was determined by MTT colorimeter method. The cell cycle phase analysis was carried out by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. The apoptosis induction was assessed by exposure to phosphatidylserine (ANNEXIN V-FITC). Cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of p53, Bcl-2 and Bax protein. The caspase-3 expression was studied by immunoblotting analysis. KEY FINDINGS: A preliminary screening of a series of ten chalcones derived from 2-naphtaldehyde showed that chalcone 8, (2E)-3-(2-naphtyl)-1-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-propen-1-one, had the highest cytotoxic effect (IC50 of 54 microM), but not in normal human lymphocytes. To better understand the cytotoxic mechanism of chalcone 8, its effect on cell cycle and apoptosis was assessed. Our results showed that chalcone 8 caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the subG0/G1 phase. Our results also demonstrated that chalcone 8 promoted a modification in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and increased p53 expression and caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: The studied chalcone 8 has cytotoxic effect against L-1210 lymphoblastic leukaemic cells, and this effect is associated with increase of p-53 and Bax expression.","['Pedrini, Fernanda Spezia', 'Chiaradia, Louise Domeneghini', 'Licinio, Marley Aparecida', 'de Moraes, Ana Carolina Rabello', 'Curta, Juliana Costa', 'Costa, Aline', 'Mascarello, Alessandra', 'Creczinsky-Pasa, Tania Beatriz', 'Nunes, Ricardo Jose', 'Yunes, Rosendo Augusto', 'Santos-Silva, Maria Claudia']","['Pedrini FS', 'Chiaradia LD', 'Licinio MA', 'de Moraes AC', 'Curta JC', 'Costa A', 'Mascarello A', 'Creczinsky-Pasa TB', 'Nunes RJ', 'Yunes RA', 'Santos-Silva MC']","['Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, Florianopolis, Brasil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"[""0 ((2E)-3-(2-naphtyl)-1-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-propen-1-one)"", '0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '66-99-9 (2-naphthaldehyde)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/chemical synthesis', 'Aldehydes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2010/08/28 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JPHP1141 [pii]', '10.1111/j.2042-7158.2010.01141.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2010 Sep;62(9):1128-36. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-7158.2010.01141.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PK1 activates multiple signals including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K-AKT, and Jak-STAT3, sphingosine kinase-1 (SPK1) in MM cells. Treatment of MM cells with PK1 causes a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK, AKT and STAT3 and upregulation of SPK1 expression and cellular activity. We also show that PK1 upregulates Mcl-1 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in human MM cell lines and in the cells of patients with MM. Pertussis toxin, a pan-PK1 receptor inhibitor, can block PK1-induced upregulation of Mcl-1, indicating it relates to a G-protein-coupled receptor. We also show that PK1 protects MM cells against apoptosis induced by starvation for fetal calf serum (FBS), or for FBS and IL-6.

While genetic alterations of the Wnt pathway are infrequent in AML, inhibitors of this pathway are silenced by promoter methylation in other malignanices. Leukemia cell lines were examined for Wnt pathway inhibitor methylation and total beta-catenin levels, and had frequent methylation of Wnt inhibitors and upregulated beta-catenin by Western blot and immunofluorescence. One hundred sixty-nine AML samples were examined for methylation of Wnt inhibitor genes. Diagnostic samples from 72 patients with normal cytogenetics who received standard high-dose induction chemotherapy were evaluated for associations between methylation and event-free or overall survival. Extensive methylation of Wnt pathway inhibitor genes was observed in cell lines, and 89% of primary AML samples had at least one methylated gene: DKK1 (16%), DKK3 (8%), RUNX3 (27%), sFRP1 (34%), sFRP2 (66%), sFRP4 (9%), sFRP5 (54%), SOX17 (29%), and WIF1 (32%). In contrast to epithelial tumors, methylation of APC (2%) and RASSF1A (0%) was rare. In patients with AML with normal cytogenetics, sFRP2 and sFRP5 methylation at the time of diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of relapse, and sFRP2 methylation was associated with an increased risk for death. In patients with AML: (a) there is a high frequency of Wnt pathway inhibitor methylation; (b) Wnt pathway inhibitor methylation is distinct from that observed in epithelial malignancies; and (c) methylation of sFRP2 and sFRP5 may predict adverse clinical outcome in patients with normal karyotype AML.","['Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Hooker, Craig', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Mohammad, Helai P', 'Ye, Ying', 'Herman, James G', 'Carraway, Hetty E']","['Griffiths EA', 'Gore SD', 'Hooker C', 'McDevitt MA', 'Karp JE', 'Smith BD', 'Mohammad HP', 'Ye Y', 'Herman JG', 'Carraway HE']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['K24 CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SFRP2 protein, human)', '0 (SFRP5 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Eye Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC4000011,['NIHMS428852'],2010/08/28 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.496505 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Sep;51(9):1711-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.496505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several classic risk factors for the development of IA, including neutropenia, graft-versus-host disease, and corticosteroid use. However, despite having similar risk profiles, only a subset of at-risk individuals will develop this fungal complication. At present, there is a significant expansion of the classically defined 'high-risk' group due to the ageing of the general population, the intensification of treatment strategies, and the introduction of new drugs into clinical practice (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, TNF inhibitors). Therefore, an improved categorization of patients would be useful in order to better target available resources and avoid the risk of potential overtreatment and toxicities.","['Caira, Morena', 'Mancinelli, Mario', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Caira M', 'Mancinelli M', 'Leone G', 'Pagano L']","['Department of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito 1, Rome, Italy. morenacaira@yahoo.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100826,England,Med Mycol,Medical mycology,9815835,['0 (Toll-Like Receptors)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aspergillosis/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Comorbidity', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Toll-Like Receptors/genetics']",,,2010/08/28 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2010/08/28 06:00'],"['2010/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13693786.2010.509138 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Mycol. 2011 Apr;49 Suppl 1:S13-6. doi: 10.3109/13693786.2010.509138.

The clinical value of a targeted intervention using the FLT3-ITD-specific inhibitor sorafenib in this situation is largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010 eight patients (4 men, 4 women; age 40-75 years) with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) before (n=4) and after allogenic SCT (n=5) were treated off-label with sorafenib. RESULTS: All patients showed rapid hematological responses. There were three complete molecular remissions when sorafenib was given after allogenic SCT. Two of them are ongoing for 12 and 15 months, respectively. Long-term remissions after prior allogenic SCT were associated with the re-establishment of a chronic graft versus host reaction. Side effects could be controlled by dose reduction. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib is apparently an effective treatment alternative for patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD positive AML. In the context of a prior allogenic SCT it may have curative potential via inducing a synergism between targeted inhibition of FLT3-ITD and anti-leukemic immunity.","['Metzelder, S K', 'Wollmer, E', 'Neubauer, A', 'Burchert, A']","['Metzelder SK', 'Wollmer E', 'Neubauer A', 'Burchert A']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Standort Marburg.']",['ger'],,['Journal Article'],20100825,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Benzenesulfonates/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', '*Off-Label Use', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'Sorafenib']",,,2010/08/27 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0030-1247870 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2010 Sep;135(38):1852-6. doi: 10.1055/s-0030-1247870.

In this study, two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the extracellular domain of P-gp were generated. By employing the generated mAbs, a two-color lysed whole blood flow cytometric method for surface P-gp and an efficient sandwich ELISA for soluble P-gp determinations were established. By using the established methods, surface and soluble P-gp were detected in several leukemia patients. The presence of soluble P-gp could be used to identify the P-gp surface expression patients.

On the basis of the presence of previous neuropathy, 50 patients were treated with RD and 49, without preexisting neuropathy, with VRD. The overall response rate was 63%, similar for RD and VRD. Poor risk cytogenetics were associated with lower response rates in RD (P=0.01), but not in VRD (P=0.219). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was similar for RD (9 months) and VRD (7 months). The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 16 months, with no differences between RD or VRD regimens. Poor risk cytogenetics, especially del17p, resistance to previous thalidomide, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and presence of extramedullary disease were associated with inferior response to therapy and shorter PFS and OS. The impact of other CAs on OS was more pronounced in RD. In conclusion, the presence of CAs is an important adverse prognostic factor for patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma, but resistance to previous thalidomide, elevated LDH and presence of extramedullary disease remain of major prognostic importance.

One analysis with 80 samples from 29 patients and 51 control subjects resulted in the detection of 61 peak differences. Another analysis with 36 paired-samples from 18 patients collected before and after the treatment with lenalidomide (Revlimid) identified 19 differential peak features. We also observed differential profiles between the pre-treatment samples from the responders and those from the non-responders reflected by eight peak differences. On the basis of these data we developed two classification models that could distinguish between the diseased and the control subjects or between the responders and the non-responders. Efforts were made to purify and identify a range of differential peak proteins. We conclude that inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor, heavy chain H4 (fragments), serum transferrin, transthyretin (variants), haemoglobin and a protein peak at m/z 2791 could be potential disease-associated markers for del(5q) MDS. Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) and a peak at m/z 8559 may serve as therapy-associated markers and be potentially useful for monitoring and predicting the response to therapy.","['Chen, C', 'Bowen, D T', 'Giagounidis, A A N', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Haase, S', 'Wright, E G']","['Chen C', 'Bowen DT', 'Giagounidis AA', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Haase S', 'Wright EG']","['Centre for Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Division of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Dentistry & Nursing, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK. c.chen@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100826,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proteome)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Proteome/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/27 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010182 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Nov;24(11):1875-84. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.182.

Intravenous transplantation of 2 of 2 ALL cell lines and 9 of 14 primary ALL cases generated leukemia-like proliferations in recipient mice by 1-7 months after transplant. Leukemias were retransplantable, and the immunophenotypes, gene rearrangements and expression profiles were identical or similar to those of the original primary samples. NOD-scid mice transplanted with the same primary samples developed similar leukemias with only a slightly longer latency than did NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-) mice. In this highly sensitive NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-)-based assay, 1-100 unsorted primary human ALL cells from five of five tested patients, four of whom eventually experienced leukemia relapse, generated leukemias in recipient mice.

Administration of ATRA leads to massive changes in gene expression, including down-regulation of cell proliferation-related genes and induction of genes involved in immune function. One of the most induced genes in APL NB4 cells is transglutaminase 2 (TG2). RNA interference-mediated stable silencing of TG2 in NB4 cells (TG2-KD NB4) coupled with whole genome microarray analysis revealed that TG2 is involved in the expression of a large number of ATRA-regulated genes. The affected genes participate in granulocyte functions, and their silencing lead to reduced adhesive, migratory, and phagocytic capacity of neutrophils and less superoxide production. The expression of genes related to cell-cycle control also changed, suggesting that TG2 regulates myeloid cell differentiation. CC chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL22, CCL24, and cytokines IL1B and IL8 involved in the development of differentiation syndrome are expressed at significantly lower level in TG2-KD NB4 than in wild-type NB4 cells upon ATRA treatment. Based on our results, we propose that reduced expression of TG2 in differentiating APL cells may suppress effector functions of neutrophil granulocytes and attenuate the ATRA-induced inflammatory phenotype of differentiation syndrome.","['Csomos, Krisztian', 'Nemet, Istvan', 'Fesus, Laszlo', 'Balajthy, Zoltan']","['Csomos K', 'Nemet I', 'Fesus L', 'Balajthy Z']","['Signalling and Apoptosis Research Group of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100825,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokines, CC/biosynthesis/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transglutaminases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/27 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31115-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-266064 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 11;116(19):3933-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-266064.

ATM mutant cells exhibit impaired DNA double strand break repair. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition that imposes the requirement for DNA double strand break repair should selectively sensitize ATM-deficient tumor cells to killing. We investigated in vitro sensitivity to the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib (AZD2281) of 5 ATM mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), an ATM mutant MCL cell line, an ATM knockdown PGA CLL cell line, and 9 ATM-deficient primary CLLs induced to cycle and observed differential killing compared with ATM wildtype counterparts. Pharmacologic inhibition of ATM and ATM knockdown confirmed the effect was ATM-dependent and mediated through mitotic catastrophe independently of apoptosis. A nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) murine xenograft model of an ATM mutant MCL cell line demonstrated significantly reduced tumor load and an increased survival of animals after olaparib treatment in vivo. Addition of olaparib sensitized ATM null tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents.

Here, we identify a novel natural ent-kaurene diterpenoid derived from Isodon pharicus leaves, called pharicin B, that can rapidly stabilize RAR-alpha protein in various acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines and primary leukemic cells from AML patients, even in the presence of ATRA, which is known to induce the loss of RAR-alpha protein. Pharicin B also enhances ATRA-dependent the transcriptional activity of RAR-alpha protein in the promyelocytic leukemia-RARalpha-positive APL cell line NB4 cells. We also showed that pharicin B presents a synergistic or additive differentiation-enhancing effect when used in combination with ATRA in several AML cell lines and, especially, some primary leukemic cells from APL patients. In addition, pharicin B can overcome retinoid resistance in 2 of 3 NB4-derived ATRA-resistant subclones. These findings provide a good example for chemical biology-based investigations of pathophysiological and therapeutic significances of RAR-alpha and PML-RAR-alpha proteins. The effectiveness of the ATRA/pharicin B combination warrants further investigation on their use as a therapeutic strategy for AML patients.","['Gu, Zhi-Min', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Zhou, Mei-Yi', 'Liu, Chuan-Xu', 'Xu, Han-Zhang', 'Yan, Hua', 'Zhao, Yong', 'Huang, Ying', 'Sun, Han-Dong', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Gu ZM', 'Wu YL', 'Zhou MY', 'Liu CX', 'Xu HZ', 'Yan H', 'Zhao Y', 'Huang Y', 'Sun HD', 'Chen GQ']","['Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (SIBS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100825,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (pharicin B)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Isodon/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*chemistry', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2010/08/27 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60211-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-267963 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 9;116(24):5289-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-267963.

Identification of molecules involved in their accumulation and differentiation is important to inform therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the expression and function of chemokine receptor CCR9 in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovium of RA, non-RA patients and healthy volunteers. METHODS: CCR9 expression on PB monocytes/macrophages was analysed by flow cytometry and in synovium by immunofluorescence. Chemokine receptor CCR9 mRNA expression was examined in RA and non-RA synovium, monocytes/macrophages from PB and synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients and PB of healthy donors using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Monocyte differentiation and chemotaxis to chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25)/TECK were used to study CCR9 function. RESULTS: CCR9 was expressed by PB monocytes/macrophages in RA and healthy donors, and increased in RA. In RA and non-RA synovia, CCR9 co-localised with cluster of differentiation 14+ (CD14+) and cluster of differentiation 68+ (CD68+) macrophages, and was more abundant in RA synovium. CCR9 mRNA was detected in the synovia of all RA patients and in some non-RA controls, and monocytes/macrophages from PB and SF of RA and healthy controls. CCL25 was detected in RA and non-RA synovia where it co-localised with CD14+ and CD68+ cells. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) increased CCR9 expression on human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 monocytic cells. CCL25 induced a stronger monocyte differentiation in RA compared to healthy donors. CCL25 induced significant chemotaxis of PB monocytes but not consistently among individuals. CONCLUSIONS: CCR9 expression by monocytes is increased in RA. CCL25 may be involved in the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages particularly in RA.","['Schmutz, Caroline', 'Cartwright, Alison', 'Williams, Helen', 'Haworth, Oliver', 'Williams, John H H', 'Filer, Andrew', 'Salmon, Mike', 'Buckley, Christopher D', 'Middleton, Jim']","['Schmutz C', 'Cartwright A', 'Williams H', 'Haworth O', 'Williams JH', 'Filer A', 'Salmon M', 'Buckley CD', 'Middleton J']","['Leopold Muller Arthritis Research Centre, Keele University, Oswestry, Shropshire, SY10 7AG, UK. c.schmutz@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['16390/ARC_/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '18547/VAC_/Versus Arthritis/United Kingdom', '18547/ARC_/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', 'G9818340/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '20088/ARC_/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100825,England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,"['0 (CC chemokine receptor 9)', '0 (CCL25 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Receptors, CCR)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines, CC/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, CCR/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Synovial Membrane/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",PMC2945064,,2010/08/27 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ar3120 [pii]', '10.1186/ar3120 [doi]']",ppublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2010;12(4):R161. doi: 10.1186/ar3120.

Its expression is restricted to the haematopoietic lineage, where it serves as a positive regulator for T cell selection and mast cell function and as a negative regulator for growth-related functions in other lineages. Here, we examined the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins in response to stimulation with interleukin 3 (IL3). RESULTS: Using the murine IL3-dependent cell line BaF3 we investigated the influence of RhoH protein expression levels on IL3-mediated cellular responses. RhoH overexpressing cells showed lower sensitivity to IL3 and decreased STAT5 activation. SiRNA-mediated repression of RhoH gene expression led to an increase in proliferation and STAT5 activity which correlated with an increased number of IL3 receptor alpha chain molecules, also known as CD123, expressed at the cell surface. Interestingly, these findings could be reproduced using human THP-1 cells as a model system for acute myeloid leukaemia, where low RhoH levels are known to be an unfavourable prognostic marker. Overexpression of RhoH on the other hand caused an induction of STAT1 activity and western blot analysis revealed that activated STAT1 is phosphorylated on Tyr701. STAT1 is known to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest and we detected an upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in RhoH overexpressing BaF3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that RhoH functions as a negative regulator for IL3-induced signals through modulation of the JAK-STAT pathway. High levels of RhoH allow the IL3-dependent activation of STAT1 causing decreased proliferation through upregulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Low RhoH levels on the other hand led to an upregulation of IL3-dependent cell growth, STAT5 activity and an increase of CD123 surface expression, linking RhoH to a CD123/STAT5 phenotype that has been described in AML patients.","['Gundogdu, Mehtap S', 'Liu, He', 'Metzdorf, Daniela', 'Hildebrand, Dagmar', 'Aigner, Michael', 'Aktories, Klaus', 'Heeg, Klaus', 'Kubatzky, Katharina F']","['Gundogdu MS', 'Liu H', 'Metzdorf D', 'Hildebrand D', 'Aigner M', 'Aktories K', 'Heeg K', 'Kubatzky KF']","['Department fur Infektiologie, Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat, Im Neuenheimer Feld 324, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100825,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (RhoH protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology']",PMC2936343,,2010/08/27 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-225 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-225 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Aug 25;9:225. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the general population, MBL increases with age with a prevalence of 5-9% in individuals over age 60 years. It has been reported to be higher among first-degree relatives from CLL families. We report results of multi-parameter flow cytometry among 505 first-degree relatives with no personal history of lymphoproliferative disease from 140 families having at least two cases of CLL. Seventeen percent of relatives had MBL. Age was the most important determinant where the probability for developing MBL by age 90 years was 61%. MBL clustered in certain families but clustering was independent of the number of known CLL cases in a family. As is the case with CLL, males had a significantly higher risk for MBL than did females (P = 0.04). MBL patients had significantly higher mean absolute lymphocyte counts (2.4 x 10(9) /l) and B-cell counts (0.53 x 10(9) /l) than those with a normal B-cell immuno-phenotype.

Blockade of CXCR4 signalling antagonizes stroma-mediated interactions and restores CLL chemosensitivity. In vivo, administration of CXCR4 antagonists effectively mobilizes haematopoietic progenitor cells. Therefore, combinations of CXCR4 blockade and cytoreductive treatment with selective activity on CLL cells may avoid potential haematotoxicity. Hence, we tested CXCR4 antagonists in the context of passive and active immunotherapeutic approaches. We evaluated how efficiently rituximab, alemtuzumab and cytotoxic T cells killed CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells in the presence and absence of a CXCR4 antagonist. Stromal cell contact attenuated rituximab- and alemtuzumab-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity of CLL cells. Addition of CXCR4 antagonists abrogated the protective effect of stroma. In contrast, stromal cells did not impair antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by activated T cells. Destruction of microtubules in CLL target cells restored the protective effect of stroma coculture for CLL cells during Natural Killer cell attack by preventing mitochondrial relocalization towards the immunological synapse. Our data identify the combination of CXCR4 antagonists with passive - but not active - immunotherapy as a promising potential treatment concept in CLL.","['Buchner, Maike', 'Brantner, Philipp', 'Stickel, Natalie', 'Prinz, Gabriele', 'Burger, Meike', 'Bar, Constance', 'Dierks, Christine', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Ott, Ariane', 'Mertelsmann, Roland', 'Gribben, John G', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Zirlik, Katja']","['Buchner M', 'Brantner P', 'Stickel N', 'Prinz G', 'Burger M', 'Bar C', 'Dierks C', 'Pfeifer D', 'Ott A', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Gribben JG', 'Veelken H', 'Zirlik K']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100825,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Rituximab', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,2010/08/27 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8316 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08316.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Oct;151(2):167-78. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08316.x.

Research has shown that these survivors suffer a variety of neurocognitive effects including changes in attention span, concentration, school performance and executive functioning. Researchers continue to study changes in therapy with the hopes of decreasing these long-term side effects without compromising overall survival rates. Others have focused on developing adaptations to how these children learn, equipping them with tools to better cope with learning deficits. Still, others have looked into pharmacological interventions. This chapter will discuss the historical course of therapy for both leukemia and brain tumors. In addition, it will highlight how late effect studies guided changes in therapeutic approach for both childhood leukemias and brain tumors.

The ferritin content of mature red cells in the circulation declined when fetal red cells replaced embryonic red cells; the cell replacement was monitored by the disappearance of embryonic epsilon-chains and the appearance of the fetal globin chains, gammaA and gammaG. A constant ratio of 0.67 was obtained for gammaG/gammaA + gammaG from the first detectable appearance (4 weeks after conception) until 13 weeks, a value which is similar to the value previously obtained at 20 weeks gestation and birth but higher than that observable in adults; thus, both gammaG and gammaA chains are produced in similar amounts throughout gestation. The high levels of ferritin in normal human embryonic erythrocytes emphasize the similarity of erythropoiesis in human embryos and other vertebrates. In addition, the results show that red cell ferritin can be used as a marker for studying the mechanism of induction of embryonic erythropoiesis in cultured cell lines, such as K562 from human chronic myelocytic leukemia, and that ferritin content may also serve as a marker for cellular transformations involving reversions to embryonic erythropoiesis.","['Theil, E C', 'Brenner, W E']","['Theil EC', 'Brenner WE']","['Department of Biochemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27650, USA.']",['eng'],['AM 20251/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['*Embryonic Development', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Fetal Blood/*chemistry', 'Humans']",,,1981/06/01 00:00,2010/09/10 06:00,['2010/08/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0012-1606(81)90419-X [pii]', '10.1016/0012-1606(81)90419-x [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1981 Jun;84(2):481-4. doi: 10.1016/0012-1606(81)90419-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to define the prognosis for adult patients with ALL after first salvage through multivariate analyses of patient and disease characteristics. METHODS: Adults with ALL who had primary resistance to frontline therapy or who had a disease recurrence after a first complete response (CR) duration <1 year were analyzed. Multivariate analyses for subsequent CR and survival were conducted. RESULTS: Seventy-five of 245 patients (31%) achieved CR. The median CR duration was 5 months, the median survival was 4.7 months. In multivariate analysis, independent poor prognostic factors for not achieving CR were age >55 years, bone marrow blasts >/=20%, and platelet count <75 x 10(9) /L. Variables that were associated independently with shorter survival were age >55 years, bone marrow blasts >/=20%, platelet count <75 x 10(9) /L, albumin level <3 g/L, and lactic dehydrogenase level >/=1000 IU/L. Patients who had >/=3 of the 5 adverse factors (45%) had a median survival of 2 to 3 months and CR rates of 8% to 15%. Achieving CR was associated independently with improved survival in a landmark multivariate analysis (P < .0001; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The current analyses identified a subset of adults patients ALL in first salvage for whom standard therapies were associated with an extremely poor outcome. The results also confirmed the importance of achieving CR to attain improved survival.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianquin', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Kantarjian HM', 'Thomas D', 'Ravandi F', 'Faderl S', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: In this study, the authors identified the Friend leukemia virus integration 1 gene (FLI1) as a novel target of miR-145. FLI1 is involved in t(11;22)(q24:q12) reciprocal chromosomal translocation in Ewing sarcoma, and its expression appears to be associated with biologically more aggressive tumors. RESULTS: The authors demonstrated that miR-145 targets a putative microRNA regulatory element in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of FLI1, and its abundance is reversely associated with FLI1 expression in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. By using a luciferase/FLI1 3'-UTR reporter system, they found that miR-145 down-regulated the reporter activity, and this down-regulation was reversed by anti-miR-145. Mutation of the miR-145 microRNA regulatory element sequence in the FLI1 3'-UTR abolished the activity of miR-145. miR-145 decreased FLI1 protein but not FLI1 mRNA, suggesting a mechanism of translational regulation. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that miR-145 inhibited cell proliferation and sensitized LS174T cells to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that miR-145 functions as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating oncogenic FLI1 in colon cancer.","['Zhang, Jianjun', 'Guo, Haiyan', 'Zhang, He', 'Wang, Haibo', 'Qian, Guanxiang', 'Fan, Xianqun', 'Hoffman, Andrew R', 'Hu, Ji-Fan', 'Ge, Shengfang']","['Zhang J', 'Guo H', 'Zhang H', 'Wang H', 'Qian G', 'Fan X', 'Hoffman AR', 'Hu JF', 'Ge S']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['R43 CA103553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 CA103553-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R43 CA103553-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100824,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN145 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",PMC2995010,['NIHMS218117'],2010/08/26 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25522 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jan 1;117(1):86-95. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25522.

We conducted a prospective study to evaluate brain perfusion with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in adult patients before and after receiving ara-C. PROCEDURES: Forty-three patients were pre-included, and 20 reached a complete remission. These 20 patients were definitively included and underwent three technetium-99m hexamethyl-propylene-amine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT acquisitions with a double-head camera: SPECT1 at AML diagnosis, SPECT2 after induction (conventional ara-C dose), and SPECT3 during HD ara-C treatment. All the included patients underwent six series of neurological and cognitive examinations: N1, N2, and N3 at the time of SPECT1, SPECT2, and SPECT3, respectively; N4 during HD ara-C treatment; N5 (at 10 days); and N6 during follow-up (at 6 months). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) was used to test perfusion changes. A specific method based on random walk (RW) was used to analyze diffuse brain perfusion heterogeneity. RESULTS: No neurological adverse effect was observed, and all neurological and cognitive examinations remained normal. Between SPECT1 and SPECT2, SPM2 analysis showed a decrease in cerebral blood flow, i.e., in the cerebellum, in the occipitoparietal cortex, and in the thalamus. No significant difference was observed between SPECT2 and SPECT3 or between SPECT1 and SPECT3. RW analysis showed no significant difference in perfusion heterogeneity between the three SPECTs. CONCLUSIONS: HMPAO SPECT demonstrated a decrease in thalamus, cerebellar, and parieto-occipital perfusion after conventional doses of ara-C in AML patients, although the neurological examinations were normal and the patients had no neurological adverse effects.","['Modzelewski, Romain', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Martinaud, Olivier', 'Hannequin, Didier', 'Hitzel, Anne', 'Habert, Marie-Odile', 'Tilly, Herve', 'Vera, Pierre']","['Modzelewski R', 'Lepretre S', 'Martinaud O', 'Hannequin D', 'Hitzel A', 'Habert MO', 'Tilly H', 'Vera P']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Rouen University Hospital, University of Rouen, Rouen, France. romain.modzelewski@rouen.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Imaging Biol,Molecular imaging and biology,101125610,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Perfusion', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11307-010-0409-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Imaging Biol. 2011 Aug;13(4):747-53. doi: 10.1007/s11307-010-0409-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of the ras/raf/MEK pathway and also targets VEGFR and cKIT. We evaluated the activity of sorafenib in patients with unresectable mesothelioma. METHODS: MM patients who had received 0 to 1 prior chemotherapy regimens were treated with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously. The primary end point was objective response. ERK1/2 phosphorylation in archival tissues was correlated with response and survival. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were enrolled, 50 were evaluable and included in the analysis. Three patients had a partial response (6% [95% confidence interval = 1.3-16.6%]), and 27 (54% [95% confidence interval = 39.3-68.2%]) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival (OS) were 3.6 and 9.7 months, respectively. Median survival was superior in epithelioid histology versus other types (10.7 versus 3.7 months, p = 0.0179). The difference in median OS between pretreated and chemonaive patients was not statistically significant (13.2 versus 5 months, p = 0.3117). Low/negative baseline tumor phospho-ERK1/2 levels were associated with improved OS (13.9 versus 5.2 months, p = 0.0066). CONCLUSION: Sorafenib has limited activity in advanced MM patients, similar to that seen with other VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Additional studies of sorafenib in MM are not warranted.","['Dubey, Sarita', 'Janne, Pasi A', 'Krug, Lee', 'Pang, Herbert', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Heinze, Robin', 'Watt, Colleen', 'Crawford, Jeff', 'Kratzke, Robert', 'Vokes, Everett', 'Kindler, Hedy Lee']","['Dubey S', 'Janne PA', 'Krug L', 'Pang H', 'Wang X', 'Heinze R', 'Watt C', 'Crawford J', 'Kratzke R', 'Vokes E', 'Kindler HL']","['University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA135257/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/*therapeutic use', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3823555,['NIHMS229523'],2010/08/26 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181ec18db [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31815-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2010 Oct;5(10):1655-61. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181ec18db.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In B-cells, Syk is involved in early B-cell receptor signaling, which affects cellular survival, proliferation and differentiation. Although the kinetics of Syk mRNA and its activity are variable in different types of tumor cells, Syk may have a relation to tumor progression in many human tumors, including B-cell lymphoma/leukemia. In this study we examined whether Syk mRNA expression was changed in bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-induced persistent lymphocytosis (PL) and lymphoma. As a result, we demonstrated that the Syk mRNA expression was significantly increased in PL samples, whereas it was decreased in tumor samples. Moreover one cow, which Syk mRNA expression has been lowest among PL cattle, developed lymphoma three months later and the expression significantly decreased.

Seventy of 960 unselected patients (7%) had autoimmune cytopenia, of whom 19 were detected at diagnosis, 3 before diagnosis, and 48 during the course of the disease. Forty-nine patients had autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 20 had immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and 1 had both conditions. A clear association was observed between autoimmune cytopenia and poor prognostic variables (ie, high blood lymphocyte count, rapid blood lymphocyte doubling time, increased serum beta-2 microglobulin level, and high expression of zeta-associated protein 70 and CD38). Nevertheless, the outcome of patients with autoimmune cytopenia as a whole was not significantly different from that of patients without this complication. Furthermore, no differences were observed according to time at which cytopenia was detected (ie, at diagnosis, during course of disease). Importantly, patients with advanced (Binet stage C) disease because of an autoimmune mechanism had a significantly better survival than patients in advanced stage related to a massive bone marrow infiltration (median survivals: 7.4 years vs 3.7 years; P = .02).

Overexpression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 is a hallmark of CLL, and their expression is further enhanced in the lymphoid tissues. However, the high levels of Mcl-1 found in peripheral blood samples, coupled with its short half-life, led us to hypothesize that it must be actively maintained in the peripheral circulation. Coculture of CLL cells with human vascular endothelial cells significantly enhanced tumor cell survival, an effect that was not observed with normal B cells. This was associated with elevated levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-X(L) and marked increased expression of CD38 and CD49d, both of which are associated with clinically aggressive disease. Because CD38, CD49d, and some Bcl-2 family genes are transcriptional targets for NF-kappaB, we assessed NF-kappaB activation following coculture with endothelial cells. DNA binding of the NF-kappaB subunit Rel A was significantly increased and strongly correlated with changes in transcription of CD38, CD49d, BCL2, MCL1, and BCLXL, effects that were reversed by a peptide inhibitor of Rel A. These effects were not observed following coculture with nonendothelial cell lines. Therefore, CLL cells receive specific survival signals following interaction with endothelial cells mediated through the activation of NF-kappaB and the induction of downstream target genes. This type of interaction in the peripheral vasculature may explain the constitutive NF-kappaB activation and the overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins commonly seen in this disease.","['Buggins, Andrea G S', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Hewamana, Saman', 'Gohil, Satyen', 'Moorhead, Jane', ""Folarin, Najeem'deen"", 'Yallop, Deborah', 'Thomas, N Shaun B', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Devereux, Stephen']","['Buggins AG', 'Pepper C', 'Patten PE', 'Hewamana S', 'Gohil S', 'Moorhead J', 'Folarin N', 'Yallop D', 'Thomas NS', 'Mufti GJ', 'Fegan C', 'Devereux S']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100824,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1634 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1634 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Oct 1;70(19):7523-33. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1634.

JNJ-26854165 is one such p53-activating agent, but its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Here, we report the effects of JNJ-26854165 in acute leukemias. JNJ-26854165 treatment induced p53-mediated apoptosis in acute leukemia cells with wild-type p53, in which p53 rapidly drives transcription-independent apoptosis followed by activation of a transcription-dependent pathway. JNJ-26854165 accelerated the proteasome-mediated degradation of p21 and antagonized the transcriptional induction of p21 by p53. Interestingly, JNJ-26854165 induced S-phase delay and upregulated E2F1 expression in p53 mutant cells, resulting in apoptosis preferentially of S-phase cells. E2F1 knockdown blocked apoptosis induced by JNJ-26854165 in p53 mutant cells. Apoptotic activity of JNJ-26854165 against primary acute leukemia cells was maintained in leukemia/stroma cocultures, unlike doxorubicin, which has reduced cytrotoxicity in coculture systems. JNJ-26854165 synergizes with 1-beta-arabinofuranosylcytosine or doxorubicin to induce p53-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that JNJ-26854165 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of acute leukemias. The presence of p53-independent apoptotic activity in addition to p53-mediated apoptosis induction, if operational in vivo, may prevent the selection of p53 mutant subclones during therapy.","['Kojima, Kensuke', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Arts, Janine', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Kojima K', 'Burks JK', 'Arts J', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA89346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089346-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639-09A19007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672-22S29015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100824,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tryptamines)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tryptamines/*pharmacology']",PMC2949269,['NIHMS231527'],2010/08/26 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0337 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0337 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Sep;9(9):2545-57. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0337.

The proliferation of NK cells from healthy individuals in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 was suppressed to 51% +/- 16% of that of the controls with CSP, to 31% +/- 19% with TAC, to 14% +/- 6% with MPA, and to 87% +/- 18% with MTX. Both CSP and TAC increased the proportion of CD16(-)CD56(bright) cells, a NK cell subset capable of secreting high amount of cytokines, and also enhanced NKp30 expression, whereas MPA markedly decreased the proportion of CD16(-)CD56(bright) cells and reduced the expression of all activating NK cell receptors, including NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46. MPA also reduced the cytotoxicity against K562 cells from 61% +/- 15% to 17% +/- 7% and that against Daudi cells from 44% +/- 4% to 4% +/- 4%, whereas the other 3 drugs did not diminish these cytotoxicities. The inhibition of NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity against leukemic cell lines by MPA was partially abolished by the inclusion of guanosine in the culture. Similar to the effect of MPA on T cells, MPA inhibited the down-regulation of p27 on NK cells induced by the incubation of NK cells in the presence of IL-2. These results suggest that MPA is a potent inhibitor of NK cells, and that its inclusion in the GVHD prophylaxis regimen might diminish the graft-versus-leukemia effect of NK cells.","['Ohata, Kinya', 'Espinoza, J Luis', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Kondo, Yukio', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Ohata K', 'Espinoza JL', 'Lu X', 'Kondo Y', 'Nakao S']","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100822,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Guanosine/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mycophenolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prodrugs/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/metabolism']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00353-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Feb;17(2):205-13. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.08.014.

One is an update of mortality in a retrospective cohort study of industrial workers and the other is a proportional mortality and case-control study among embalmers. Both studies included subjects with considerable exposure to formaldehyde and both are focused on the myeloid leukemias. METHODS: The principal epidemiologic methods and analyses used in the studies are described and evaluated. Additional measures of risk are presented. RESULTS: Neither study reports a significant excess of mortality from any form of lymphohematopoietic cancer. However, both studies are interpreted by their authors as positive for an association between formaldehyde and the myeloid leukemias. This is based on weak and transitory associations seen in exposure-response analyses of relative risks. Issues are raised relating to the interpretation of these findings. CONCLUSION: There is no statistically significant absolute excess mortality from any lymphohematopoietic cancer in either study. The study of industrial workers showed only a weak and transitory relationship between peak exposure to formaldehyde and the myeloid leukemias. Limited exposure-response relationships for the myeloid leukemias in the case-control study of embalmers apparently have not been analyzed for statistical significance. These limited exposure-response relationships do not provide clear evidence of a causal relationship between formaldehyde and the myeloid leukemias.","['Cole, Philip', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Trichopoulos, Dimitrios', 'Mandel, Jack']","['Cole P', 'Adami HO', 'Trichopoulos D', 'Mandel J']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100822,Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,"['0 (Disinfectants)', '0 (Fixatives)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Disinfectants/adverse effects', 'Embalming', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Fixatives/adverse effects', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0273-2300(10)00140-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yrtph.2010.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2010 Nov;58(2):161-6. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2010.08.013.

They represent an extensive source of genetic materials and proteins to be investigated for clinical usage. We conducted the study to explore the possibility of extracting RNA from FPE of lung cancer, and checking up the transcription levels of the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) by RT-PCR. METHODS: five fresh frozen lung adenocarcinoma tissues and 40 FPEs of lung cancer were chosen; FPEs had been conserved for 60-85 months. All samples had been identified lacking expression of PML protein by immunohistochemical staining. The total RNA was extracted by using Trizol one-step method, and verified by testing OD value. RT-PCR was used to detect the transcription level of PML gene. RESULTS: The RNAs from both tissues had the OD value ranging from 1.7 to 2.1. RT-PCR results displayed that mRNA of PML (295 bps) and beta-actin (318 bps) was not absent in all cancer tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Trizol one-step method is easily accessible, and reliable for extracting RNA in fragments around 300 bases from FPEs. Loss of PML protein in lung cancer is not caused by downward adjustment of mRNA.","['Zhao, Zhilong', 'Zong, Zhihong', 'Li, Jianxin', 'Liu, Hongxu', 'Zhao, Huiru']","['Zhao Z', 'Zong Z', 'Li J', 'Liu H', 'Zhao H']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Hospital, China Medical University,Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, China;Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Dalian University, Dalian, Liaoning 116001, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer,101126433,,,,,,2008/08/20 00:00,2008/08/20 00:01,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/08/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2008.04.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi. 2008 Aug 20;11(4):563-6. doi: 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2008.04.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that the basal-like subtype cell lines display high constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, whose inhibition in the basal-like subtypes suppressed their proliferation. Moreover, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) is involved in the constitutive NF-kappaB activation. Here, we report that enhanced NIK expression, which is exclusively observed in the basal-like subtype rather than the luminal-like subtype or non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, is caused by epigenetic alteration of the NIK gene. The stability of NIK mRNA and transcriptional activity driven by the NIK promoter are similar in the basal-like and luminal-like subtypes. However, histone H3 acetylation levels were up-regulated in the basal-like subtype. Furthermore, treatment of the luminal-like subtype with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid, significantly increased NIK expression. Although DNA methylation of the NIK locus was not detected, NIK expression also increased when the luminal-like subtype was treated with 5-azacytidine, which inhibits histone H3-Lys-9 dimethylation in addition to DNA methylation. Taken together, these results suggest that the closed chromatin structure mediated by histone H3 methylation and deacetylation suppresses NIK expression in the luminal-like subtype, whereas disruption of these suppression mechanisms leads to enhanced NIK expression and the constitutive NF-kappaB activation in the basal-like subtype. Thus, NIK and genes induced by the NIK-mediated constitutive NF-kappaB activation could be therapeutic targets of basal-like breast cancer.","['Yamamoto, Mizuki', 'Ito, Taku', 'Shimizu, Takafumi', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Semba, Kentaro', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Yamaguchi, Noritaka', 'Inoue, Jun-Ichiro']","['Yamamoto M', 'Ito T', 'Shimizu T', 'Ishida T', 'Semba K', 'Watanabe S', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Inoue J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology Laboratory of Stem Cell Therapy, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Shirokane-dai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100824,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1685 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01685.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Nov;101(11):2391-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01685.x.

Pulmonary infiltration of differentiating leukaemic cells is a key event in the development of DS. Several mediators have been identified that may promote migration and extravasation of differentiating APL cells from the bloodstream into the tissue. Adhesion of APL cells to each other and to the endothelium is induced by upregulation of the expression of adhesion molecules and constitutively active beta2-integrins during differentiation therapy. The expression of chemokines and their receptors is significantly upregulated as well. Pulmonary chemokine production can trigger transendothelial migration of differentiating APL cells from the bloodstream into the underlying tissue (initiation phase of DS). Massive production of chemokines by infiltrated APL cells can further enhance transendothelial migration of differentiating APL cells, causing an uncontrollable hyperinflammatory reaction in the lung (aggravation phase), which is not efficiently switched-off by corticosteroids.","['Luesink, Maaike', 'Jansen, Joop H']","['Luesink M', 'Jansen JH']","['Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokines)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemokines/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Syndrome']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8325 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08325.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Nov;151(3):209-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08325.x.,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have established PR1 peptide, an HLA-A2.1-restricted peptide derived from proteinase 3 (P3), as a human leukemia-associated antigen. PR1-specific CTL elicited in vitro from healthy donors have been shown to lyse P3-expressing AML cells from patients. We investigated whether PR1-CTL can be adoptively transferred into NOD/SCID mice to eliminate human leukemia cells. METHODS: PR1-CTL were generated in bulk culture from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with autologous dendritic cells. Human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples were injected and engrafted in murine bone marrow at 2 weeks post-transfer. RESULTS: Following adoptive transfer, bone marrow aspirate from mice that received AML alone had 72-88% blasts in a hypercellular marrow, whereas mice that received AML plus PR1-CTL co-infusion had normal hematopoietic elements and only 3-18% blasts in a hypocellular marrow. The PR1-CTL persisted in the bone marrow and liver and maintained a CD45RA(-)CD28+ effector phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We found that adoptive transfer of PR1-CTL generated in vitro is associated with reduced AML cells in NOD/SCID mice. PR1-CTL can migrate to the sites of disease and maintain their capacity to kill the AML cells. The surface phenotype of PR1-CTL was consistent with their trafficking pattern in both vascular and end-organ tissues.","['Ma, Qing', 'Wang, Changqing', 'Jones, Dan', 'Quintanilla, Kathryn E', 'Li, Dan', 'Wang, Yang', 'Wieder, Eric D', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Mj, You', 'Munsell, Mark F', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Ma Q', 'Wang C', 'Jones D', 'Quintanilla KE', 'Li D', 'Wang Y', 'Wieder ED', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Alatrash G', 'Mj Y', 'Munsell MF', 'Lu S', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 900, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. qma@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100824,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/growth & development/pathology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloblastin/immunology/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Burden']",PMC3365857,['NIHMS378046'],2010/08/26 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2010.506506 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(10)70474-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2010 Dec;12(8):1056-62. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2010.506506.

We also investigated the relationship between the number of SSC(lo) CD45(dim) CD34(hi) cells, SSC(lo) ALDH(br) cells and engraftment. METHODS: Thirty patients (20 males and 10 females), who were candidates for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, were included in the study. Cyclophosphamide + G-CSF was used for 17 and G-CSF alone for 24 mobilizations. Primary diagnoses were multiple myeloma (n = 14), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 7), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2), acute myloid leukemia (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1) and germ cell testis tumor (n = 1). RESULTS: Numbers of SSC(lo) CD45(dim) CD34(hi) cells and SSC(lo) ALDH(br) cells were highly correlated in both peripheral blood and apheresis products (P < 0.001). We could not find a relationship between the transplanted SSC(lo) CD45(dim) CD34(hi) cell dose or SSC(lo) ALDH(br) cell dose and platelet or neutrophil recovery. The optimal thresholds for SSC(lo) CD45(dim) CD34(hi) cells were 5.40 x 10(6)/kg for neutrophil recovery and 7.22 x 10(6)/kg for platelet recovery. The optimal thresholds for SSC(lo) ALDH(br) cells were 6.53 x 10(6)/kg for neutrophil recovery and 8.72 x 10(6)/kg platelet recovery.

In the present study, we found that hispidulin potentiated the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells and converted TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-sensitive cells. When examined for its mechanism, we found that hispidulin was highly effective in activation of caspases 8 and caspase 3 and consequent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, we found that hispidulin downregulated the expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. Whereas the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was less pronounced, the downregulation of Mcl-1 was quite dramatic and was time-dependent. This sensitization is controlled through the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is the central energy-sensing system of the cell. Interestingly, we determined that AMPK is activated upon hispidulin treatment, resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease. Therefore, our results show a novel mechanism for the sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis linking hispidulin treatment to Mcl-1 downexpression. In addition, this study provides a rationale for the combined use of death receptor (DR) ligands with AMPK activators or mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of human cancers.","['Yang, Jung-Mu', 'Hung, Chao-Ming', 'Fu, Chen-Nan', 'Lee, Jang-Chang', 'Huang, Chi-Hung', 'Yang, Muh-Hwa', 'Lin, Chih-Li', 'Kao, Jung-Yie', 'Way, Tzong-Der']","['Yang JM', 'Hung CM', 'Fu CN', 'Lee JC', 'Huang CH', 'Yang MH', 'Lin CL', 'Kao JY', 'Way TD']","['Institute of Biochemistry, College of Life Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'N7F61604C2 (hispidulin)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/26 06:00,2011/01/15 06:00,['2010/08/26 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jf102304g [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2010 Sep 22;58(18):10020-6. doi: 10.1021/jf102304g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we describe a short-hairpin RNA-based RNAi screening of a set of functionally uncharacterized human genes for their possible capability to inhibit apoptosis. We thereby identified a new antiapoptotic function for CHMP5 (charged multivesicular body protein 5), which was confirmed by overexpression and rescue assays. Furthermore, caspase assays showed that CHMP5 silencing induced caspase cascade activation mainly through extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Based on genome-wide expression array profiling, a possible regulatory role of CHMP5 on apoptosis-associated genes and different signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappa B was revealed. In addition, we found significantly higher CHMP5 mRNA levels in acute myeloid leukemia patients. This observation together with the antiapoptotic feature of CHMP5 suggests a possible oncogenic function for this gene in leukemogenesis.","['Shahmoradgoli, Maria', 'Mannherz, Otto', 'Engel, Felix', 'Heck, Stefanie', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Pscherer, Armin', 'Lichter, Peter']","['Shahmoradgoli M', 'Mannherz O', 'Engel F', 'Heck S', 'Kramer A', 'Seiffert M', 'Pscherer A', 'Lichter P']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20101019,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CHMP5 protein, human)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2010/08/25 06:00,2011/06/28 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25632 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Jun 15;128(12):2865-71. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25632.

In culture pluripotency is maintained by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) stimulation of two separate signaling axes: Stat3/Klf4/Sox2 and PI3K/Tbx3/Nanog, which converge in the regulation of Oct4 expression. However, LIF signaling is not required in vivo for self-renewal, thus alternate signaling axes likely mediate these pathways. Additional factors that promote pluripotency gene expression have been identified, including the direct regulation of Oct4 by liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) and beta-catenin regulation of Nanog. Here, we present genetic, molecular, and pharmacological studies identifying a signaling axis in which beta-catenin promotes pluripotency gene expression in an Lrh-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, Lrh-1 was identified as a novel beta-catenin target gene, and Lrh-1 regulation is required for maintaining proper levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Tbx3. Elucidation of this pathway provides an alternate mechanism by which the primary pluripotency axis may be regulated in vivo and may pave the way for small molecule applications to manipulate pluripotency or improve the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming.","['Wagner, Ryan T', 'Xu, Xueping', 'Yi, Fei', 'Merrill, Bradley J', 'Cooney, Austin J']","['Wagner RT', 'Xu X', 'Yi F', 'Merrill BJ', 'Cooney AJ']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01-GM081627/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007165/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128571-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK73524/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM081627/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HD07165/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK073524/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nr5a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC2996860,,2010/08/25 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.502 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2010 Oct;28(10):1794-804. doi: 10.1002/stem.502.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to ligands on surfaces, soluble multivalent ligands can serially engage cell surface receptors with sites on the ligand, binding and dissociating from receptors many times before all ligand sites become free and the ligand leaves the surface. To evaluate the role of serial engagement in Syk activation, we use a detailed mathematical model of the initial signaling cascade that is triggered when FcepsilonRI is aggregated on mast cells by multivalent Ags. Although serial engagement is not required for mast cell signaling, it can influence the recruitment of Syk to the receptor and subsequent Syk phosphorylation. Simulating the response of mast cells to ligands that serially engage receptors at different rates shows that increasing the rate of serial engagement by increasing the rate of dissociation of the ligand-receptor bond decreases Syk phosphorylation. Increasing serial engagement by increasing the rate at which receptors are cross-linked (for example by increasing the forward rate constant for cross-linking or increasing the valence of the ligand) increases Syk phosphorylation. When serial engagement enhances Syk phosphorylation, it does so by partially reversing the effects of kinetic proofreading. Serial engagement rapidly returns receptors that have dissociated from aggregates to new aggregates before the receptors have fully returned to their basal state.","['Nag, Ambarish', 'Monine, Michael I', 'Blinov, Michael L', 'Goldstein, Byron']","['Nag A', 'Monine MI', 'Blinov ML', 'Goldstein B']","['Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 GM035556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM035556-27/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM076570/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR022232/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-GM035556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100823,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (FCER1A protein, rat)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', '*Models, Immunological', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Transport/genetics/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/*immunology']",PMC3102320,['NIHMS292275'],2010/08/25 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000326 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000326 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Sep 15;185(6):3268-76. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000326.

The significant progress made during recent years has been based on the determination of the commonly deleted region and the demonstration of haploinsufficiency for the ribosomal gene RPS14. The functional screening of all the genes in the commonly deleted region determined that RPS14 haploinsufficiency is the probable cause of the erythroid defect in the 5q- syndrome. A mouse model of the human 5q- syndrome has now been created by chromosomal engineering involving a large-scale deletion of the Cd74-Nid67 interval (containing RPS14). A variety of lines of evidence support the model of ribosomal deficiency causing p53 activation and defective erythropoiesis, including most notably the crossing of the ""5q- mice"" with p53-deficient mice, thereby ameliorating the erythroid progenitor defect. Emerging evidence supports the notion that the p53 activation observed in the mouse model may also apply to the human 5q- syndrome. Other mouse modeling data suggest that haploinsufficiency of the microRNA genes miR-145 and miR-146a may contribute to the thrombocytosis seen in the 5q- syndrome.

Midostaurin (PKC412; N-benzoylstaurosporin) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with demonstrated activity in patients with AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with FLT3 mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients with AML or MDS with either wild-type (n = 60) or mutated (n = 35) FLT3 were randomly assigned to receive oral midostaurin at 50 or 100 mg twice daily. The drug was discontinued in the absence of response at 2 months, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Response was defined as complete response, partial response (PR), hematologic improvement, or reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts by >/= 50% (BR). RESULTS: The rate of BR for the population in whom efficacy could be assessed (n = 92) was 71% in patients with FLT3-mutant and 42% in patients with FLT3 wild-type. One PR occurred in a patient with FLT3-mutant receiving the 100-mg dose regimen. Both doses were well-tolerated; there were no differences in toxicity or response rate according to the dose of midostaurin. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that midostaurin has hematologic activity in both patients with FLT3-mutant and wild-type. The degree of clinical activity observed supports additional studies that combine midostaurin and other agents such as chemotherapy especially in FLT3-mutant AML.","['Fischer, Thomas', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Lanza, Carlo', 'Fox, Edward', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Feldman, Eric J', 'Schiller, Gary J', 'Klimek, Virginia M', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Dutreix, Catherine', 'Huntsman-Labed, Alice', 'Virkus, Jodi', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Fischer T', 'Stone RM', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Galinsky I', 'Estey E', 'Lanza C', 'Fox E', 'Ehninger G', 'Feldman EJ', 'Schiller GJ', 'Klimek VM', 'Nimer SD', 'Gilliland DG', 'Dutreix C', 'Huntsman-Labed A', 'Virkus J', 'Giles FJ']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100823,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC4135183,,2010/08/25 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.9678 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.9678 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Oct 1;28(28):4339-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.9678.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In phase I, the MTD of once daily oral doses of tosedostat in hematologic malignancies was defined. In phase II, the therapeutic activity of the maximum-acceptable dose (MAD) of tosedostat was evaluated in elderly and/or relapsing patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome. RESULTS: In phase I, 16 patients were treated in four cohorts with tosedostat (60 mg to 180 mg) for 28 days. Three patients reported dose-limiting toxicities: two with reversible thrombocytopenia (> 75% reduction in platelet count) at 180 mg (MTD) and one with a Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 ALT elevation at 130 mg (MAD). In phase II, 41 patients were treated with 130 mg tosedostat. In phases I and II, the most common severe (CTC grades 3 to 5) adverse event was a reduction in the platelet count. Of the 51 AML patients in this study, seven reached complete marrow response (< 5% marrow blasts), with three achieving complete remission, and a further seven patients reaching a partial marrow response (between 5% and 15% marrow blasts). The overall response rate was therefore 27%. All responders were age > 60 years, and 79% had either relapsed or refractory AML. CONCLUSION: This phase I/II study demonstrates that oral once daily dosing with 130 mg tosedostat is well tolerated and has significant antileukemic activity. The favorable risk-benefit profile suggests that further clinical trials are warranted.","['Lowenberg, Bob', 'Morgan, Gareth', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Zachee, Pierre', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Dierickx, Daan', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'Krug, Utz', 'Bone, Elisabeth', 'Flores, Nicolas', 'Richardson, Alison F', 'Hooftman, Leon', 'Jenkins, Chris', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Davies, Faith']","['Lowenberg B', 'Morgan G', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Burnett AK', 'Zachee P', 'Duhrsen U', 'Dierickx D', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Sonneveld P', 'Krug U', 'Bone E', 'Flores N', 'Richardson AF', 'Hooftman L', 'Jenkins C', 'Zweegman S', 'Davies F']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands. b.lowenberg@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20100823,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'KZK563J2UW (tosedostat)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Glycine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/25 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.27.6295 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.27.6295 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Oct 1;28(28):4333-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.6295.

Elevated expression of Mcl-1 induces resistance to ABT-737 in SCLC. Based on the short half-life of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, we hypothesized that the actinomycin D could reverse Mcl-1-induced resistance to ABT-737. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The dose-response of multiple SCLC cell lines to actinomycin D in the absence and presence of ABT-737 was followed by the assessment of Bcl-2 family expression and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage by Western blot, viability by tetrazolium dye reduction and clonogenic assay, and cell cycle kinetics by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Actinomycin D decreased Mcl-1 expression and resulted in a cell line-dependent increase in Noxa expression. Clinically relevant concentrations of actinomycin D from 0.4 to 4 ng/mL showed single-agent activity across a panel of SCLC cell lines. When combined with low micromolar doses of ABT-737, near complete loss of viability was seen with synergistic combination indices of 0.5 to 0.7. Exposure to 4 ng/mL actinomycin was only required for the first 24 hours of the combined incubation, mimicking a clinically achievable area under the curve, but the presence of ABT-737 was required for an additional 48 hours to obtain maximal effect. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant concentrations of actinomycin D act synergistically with ABT-737 to induce SCLC apoptosis, which can be at least partially attributed to the actinomycin D-induced decrease in Mcl-1 and increase in Noxa expression. Taken together, these data suggest the feasibility of combining actinomycin D with BH3-mimetic drugs in the clinical setting.","['Xu, Haishan', 'Krystal, Geoffrey W']","['Xu H', 'Krystal GW']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100823,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,,2010/08/25 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0640 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0640 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 1;16(17):4392-400. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0640.

The current study sought to determine the mechanism of anti-cancer activity of 2-ME2 in human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells. Results showed that 2-ME2 markedly suppressed proliferation of CEM cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 2-ME2-treated CEM cells underwent typical apoptotic changes. Exposure to 2-ME2 led to G(2)/M phase cell-cycle arrest, which preceded apoptosis characterized by the appearance of a sub-G(1) cell population. In addition, cytosolic cytochrome c release, increased procaspase-9 and -3 expressions, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and induced expression of caspase-8 were detected, suggesting that both the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and extrinsic apoptotic pathway were involved in 2-ME2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the expression level of p21 protein was upregulated, whereas Bcl-2 and dysfunctional p53 protein were downregulated, which also contributed to 2-ME2-induced apoptosis. Our findings revealed that 2-ME2 might be a potent natural candidate for chemotherapeutic treatment of human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia when the precise effects of 2-ME2 were investigated further in other T leukemia cell lines and in primary T-cell leukemias.","['Zhang, Xueya', 'Huang, Haobo', 'Xu, Zhenshu', 'Zhan, Rong']","['Zhang X', 'Huang H', 'Xu Z', 'Zhan R']","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100809,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)']",IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2010/08/25 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gmq065 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmq065 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2010 Sep;42(9):615-22. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmq065.

AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to elucidate anti-allergic effects of the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM, family Labiatae) and its main constituents, tanshinones, against passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCA reaction was induced by IgE-antigen complex (IAC) in ICR mice. Protein expression of IL-4 and TNF-alpha in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB and c-jun (AP-1) activation assayed by immunoblot. RESULTS: Tanshinones inhibited the PCA reaction and reduced IL-4 and TNF-alpha production in mice as well as in IAC-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Tanshinones also inhibited NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with IAC. Among tested tanshinones, tanshinone I exhibited the most potent inhibition, followed by 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I, tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone. CONCLUSIONS: SM and tanshinones may ameliorate the PCA reaction by inhibiting the allergic cytokines IL-4 and TNF-alpha via NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways.","['Trinh, Hien Trung', 'Chae, Sun Ju', 'Joh, Eun-Ha', 'Son, Kun Ho', 'Jeon, Su Jin', 'Kim, Dong-Hyun']","['Trinh HT', 'Chae SJ', 'Joh EH', 'Son KH', 'Jeon SJ', 'Kim DH']","['Department of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemun-Ku, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100821,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Camphanes)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (danshen dripping pill)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Abietanes', 'Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Camphanes', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Interleukin-4/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Panax notoginseng', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Phenanthrenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rhizome/chemistry', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza/*chemistry', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology']",,,2010/08/25 06:00,2011/02/10 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(10)00516-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.037 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2010 Oct 28;132(1):344-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.037.

While AA is most commonly known for its antioxidant properties, it is also known to function as a pro-oxidant under select conditions. However, the complexity and often unknown composition of biological culture systems makes prediction of AA behaviour in supplemented cultures challenging. The frequent observation of outcomes inconsistent with antioxidant behaviour suggests that AA may be playing a pro-oxidant role more often than appreciated. In this work we explored the intracellular and extracellular impact of AA supplementation on KG1a myeloid leukaemia cells over a 24-h culture period following the addition of the AA supplement. At 24h we found that supplementation of AA up to 250muM resulted in intracellular antioxidant behaviour. However, when these same cultures were evaluated at 2 or 4h we observed pro-oxidant activity at the higher AA concentrations indicating that the outcome was very much time and dose dependent. In contrast, pro-oxidant activity was never observed in the extracellular medium.

Although this oncogene was described in leukemia, it is overexpressed in a number of solid tumors as well. The oncogenic potential of Bcl-3 has been associated with its capacity to increase proliferation by means of activating the cyclin D1 promoter and to its antiapoptotic role mediated by the inhibiton of p53 activity. In the course of dissecting these properties, we found that depleting Bcl-3 protein using shRNAs induce a decrease of proliferation and clonogenic survival associated with the induction of multinucleation and increased ploidy. These effects were associated with a DNA damage response, a delay in G2/M checkpoint and the induction of centrosome amplification.","['Zamora, Ruben', 'Espinosa, Magali', 'Ceballos-Cancino, Gisela', 'Segura, Blanca', 'Maldonado, Vilma', 'Melendez-Zajgla, Jorge']","['Zamora R', 'Espinosa M', 'Ceballos-Cancino G', 'Segura B', 'Maldonado V', 'Melendez-Zajgla J']","['Biotechnology Unit, Grupo Farmaceutico Neolpharma, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100824,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Cell Cycle', '*Centrosome', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC2933622,,2010/08/25 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/25 06:00'],"['2009/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-223 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-223 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Aug 24;9:223. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We attempted to replicate these findings in 71 patients with CLL and 1273 controls in Hong Kong Chinese. Three of the six variants were significantly associated with CLL. The rs872071 variant (Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval) = 1.78 (1.25-2.53), P = 0.0013) in the IRF4 gene region showed the strongest association, similar to that reported in the UK study.

In this study, we found that DeltaEF1 was positively regulated by T-lineage-specific transcriptional regulator GATA3, while ectopically expressed LMO2 targeted to DeltaEF1 promoter by interaction with GATA3 and inhibited DeltaEF1 expression in transcriptional level. Moreover, LMO2 interacted with the N-terminal zinc finger domain of DeltaEF1 protein and inhibited its positive transcriptional regulatory function by this interaction.

Animal experiments indicate that blockade of the angiotensin AT1 receptor (AT1R) improves neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia. These protective effects are partially mediated by the angiotensin AT2 receptor (AT2R). The transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) was identified as a direct adapter protein of the AT2R. Furthermore, our group was able to demonstrate that PLZF also directly binds and mediates the effects of the human (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] which is involved in brain development. Therefore, we hypothesized that PLZF is involved in neuroprotection. Here we show that PLZF and its receptors (P)RR and AT2R exhibited an ubiquitous expression pattern in different brain regions. Furthermore, stable PLZF overexpression in human neuronal cells was able to mediate neuroprotection in a glutamate toxicity model in vitro. Consistently, PLZF mRNA and protein were downregulated on the ipsilateral side in a stroke model in vivo, whereas the neurodetrimental PLZF target genes cyclin A2 and BID were upregulated under this condition. Further analyses indicated that the neuroprotective AT2R is upregulated upon stable PLZF overexpression in cultured neuronal cells.

Data were analyzed using chi(2) and conditional logistic regression model. None of the polymorphisms studied alone was associated with increased risk for AML.

We recently reported on the prognostic value of MRD during the induction of remission through a simplified PCR method. Here, we report on gene rearrangement frequencies and offer guidelines for the application of the technique. PROCEDURE: Two hundred thirty-three children had DNA extracted from bone marrow. Ig and TCR gene rearrangements were amplified using consensus primers and conventional PCR. PCR products were submitted to homo/heteroduplex analysis. A computer program was designed to define combinations of targets for clonal detection using a minimum set of primers and reactions. RESULTS: At least one clonal marker could be detected in 98% of the patients, and two markers in approximately 80%. The most commonly rearranged genes in precursor B-cell ALL were IgH (75%), TCRD (59%), IgK (55%), and TCRG (54%). The most commonly rearranged genes for T-ALL were TCRG (100%) and TCRD (24%). The sensitivity of primers was limited to the detection of 1 leukemic cell among 100 normal cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that eight PCR reactions per ALL subtype would allow for the detection of two markers in most cases.

Building upon recent studies of viral-synthetic hybrid vectors, we report the effects of serum on the formation, activity and stability of PEI/M-VLP complexes. METHODS: M-VLP were produced by cells grown in serum-supplemented media (M-VLP-S), serum-free media (M-VLP-SF) or serum-free Opti-MEM(R) I (M-VLP-OM). PEI/M-VLP stoichiometry was varied to investigate complex formation and optimal transfection conditions. The effects of prolonged storage, freeze-thaw cycles, and ultracentrifugation of M-VLP on the stability of vector transduction efficiency were also observed. RESULTS: M-VLP-S required more PEI to form infective complexes than M-VLP-SF and M-VLP-OM. The stoichiometry of PEI/M-VLP-S was dependent on total PEI concentration (7-8 mug/100 muL M-VLP supernatant), while optimal infectivity of PEI/M-VLP-SF and PEI/M-VLP-OM depended on PEI/M-VLP ratios (12-17 mug and 10-14 mug PEI/10(9) M-VLP, respectively). PEI/M-VLP-SF and PEI/M-VLP-OM complexes were significantly more efficient than PEI/M-VLP-S. Stability of the hybrid vectors was not significantly affected by serum. CONCLUSIONS: PEI/M-VLP complexes exhibiting increased efficiency were constructed by producing M-VLP in serum-free media. M-VLP could be stored by freezing or refrigeration and concentrated by ultracentrifugation without unacceptable loss of infectivity.","['Drake, David M', 'Keswani, Rahul K', 'Pack, Daniel W']","['Drake DM', 'Keswani RK', 'Pack DW']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois, Box C-3, 600 South Mathews Avenue, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100821,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)']",IM,"['*Blood', '*Drug Carriers', '*Polyethyleneimine', '*Transfection']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11095-010-0238-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 2010 Nov;27(11):2457-65. doi: 10.1007/s11095-010-0238-z.

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of earlier genome-wide gene expression studies to identify pathway-based genes that are associated with therapeutic response. The predictive power of these genes was validated by transcript profiling in diagnostic bone marrow samples from Ph+ ALL patients using a quantitative real-time PCR array. Gene expression was correlated with cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, including presence of ABL1 mutations and IKZF1 deletion. A total of 43 de novo Ph+ ALL patients treated uniformly with tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with chemotherapy were selected to validate 46 identified genes. A 9-gene signature was established to distinguish optimal responders from patients with persistent residual disease and early molecular recurrence. The signature was subsequently validated with 87% predictive accuracy in an independent validation set of patients. When initially optimal responders relapsed, their gene expression patterns also shifted. Optimal responders showed upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis pathways, whereas poor responders had higher expression of genes that facilitate tumor cell survival in hypoxic conditions as well as development of drug resistance. This unique 9-gene signature may better enable stratification of patients to proper therapeutic regimens and provides new insights into mechanisms of Ph+ ALL response to therapy.","['Zuo, Zhuang', 'Jones, Dan', 'Yao, Hui', 'Thomas, Deborah A', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Chen, Su S', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi']","['Zuo Z', 'Jones D', 'Yao H', 'Thomas DA', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Chen SS', 'Luthra R']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20100820,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genes, abl', '*Genetic Testing', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2010137 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2010.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Nov;23(11):1524-34. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2010.137.

Most cases of TAM carry somatic GATA1 mutations resulting in the exclusive expression of a truncated protein (GATA1s). However, there are no reports on the expression levels of GATA1s in TAM blasts, and the risk factors for the progression to ML-DS are unidentified. To test whether the spectrum of transcripts derived from the mutant GATA1 genes affects the expression levels, we classified the mutations according to the types of transcripts, and investigated the modalities of expression by in vitro transfection experiments using GATA1 expression constructs harboring mutations. We show here that the mutations affected the amount of mutant protein. Based on our estimates of GATA1s protein expression, the mutations were classified into GATA1s high and low groups. Phenotypic analyses of 66 TAM patients with GATA1 mutations revealed that GATA1s low mutations were significantly associated with a risk of progression to ML-DS (P < .001) and lower white blood cell counts (P = .004). Our study indicates that quantitative differences in mutant protein levels have significant effects on the phenotype of TAM and warrants further investigation in a prospective study.","['Kanezaki, Rika', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Xu, Gang', 'Wang, Runan', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Kawakami, Kiyoshi', 'Endo, Mikiya', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Kogawa, Kazuhiro', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiko', 'Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Kanezaki R', 'Toki T', 'Terui K', 'Xu G', 'Wang R', 'Shimada A', 'Hama A', 'Kanegane H', 'Kawakami K', 'Endo M', 'Hasegawa D', 'Kogawa K', 'Adachi S', 'Ikeda Y', 'Iwamoto S', 'Taga T', 'Kosaka Y', 'Kojima S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100820,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/genetics', 'Phenotype']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31019-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-282426 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4631-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-282426.

One of the known limitations of cytogenetic analysis is the inability to detect genomic abnormalities less than 5 Mb in size, and it is currently unclear whether overcoming this limitation with high-resolution genomic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis would be clinically relevant. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of molecular mechanisms/aberrations that underlie the conventional karyotype-based risk classifications, it is likely that further refinements in genomic risk prognostication can be achieved. In this study, we analyzed flow cytometer-sorted, AML blast-derived, and paired, buccal DNA from 114 previously untreated prospectively enrolled AML patients for acquired genomic copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays, and we correlated genomic lesion load and specific chromosomal abnormalities with patient survival. Using multivariate analyses, we found that having >/= 2 genomic lesions detected through SNP 6.0 array profiling approximately doubles the risk of death when controlling for age- and karyotype-based risk. Finally, we identified an independent negative prognostic impact of p53 mutations, or p53 mutations and 17p-loss of heterozygosity combined on survival in AML.","['Parkin, Brian', 'Erba, Harry', 'Ouillette, Peter', 'Roulston, Diane', 'Purkayastha, Anjali', 'Karp, Judith', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Kujawski, Lisa', 'Shakhan, Sajid', 'Li, Cheng', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Parkin B', 'Erba H', 'Ouillette P', 'Roulston D', 'Purkayastha A', 'Karp J', 'Talpaz M', 'Kujawski L', 'Shakhan S', 'Li C', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA136537-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100820,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC3012590,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60260-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-266999 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 2;116(23):4958-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-266999.

They also avoid recognition by CTLs, which occurs primarily through decreasing the level of MHC class I (MHC-I) at the cell surface. We find that the two phenomena are linked; culture conditions that force respiration in leukemia cells upregulate MHC-I transcription and protein levels at the cell surface, whereas these decrease in cells forced to perform fermentation as well as in leukemia cells lacking a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain. Forced respiration leads to increased expression of the MAPK ERK5, which activates MHC-I gene promoters, and ERK5 accumulation in mitochondria. Respiration-induced MHC-I upregulation is reversed upon short hairpin RNA-mediated ERK5 downregulation and by inactive mutants of ERK5. Moreover, short hairpin RNA for ERK5 leukemia cells do not tolerate forced respiration. Thus, the expression of ERK5 and MHC-I is linked to cell metabolism and notably diminished by the metabolic adaptations found in tumor cells.","['Charni, Seyma', 'de Bettignies, Geoffroy', 'Rathore, Moeez G', 'Aguilo, Juan I', 'van den Elsen, Peter J', 'Haouzi, Delphine', 'Hipskind, Robert A', 'Enriquez, Jose Antonio', 'Sanchez-Beato, Margarita', 'Pardo, Julian', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Charni S', 'de Bettignies G', 'Rathore MG', 'Aguilo JI', 'van den Elsen PJ', 'Haouzi D', 'Hipskind RA', 'Enriquez JA', 'Sanchez-Beato M', 'Pardo J', 'Anel A', 'Villalba M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5535, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100820,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', '*Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1001250 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1001250 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Sep 15;185(6):3498-503. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1001250.

Two major mechanism-based arguments against formaldehyde as a leukemogen have been the difficulty in envisioning how inhaled formaldehyde might penetrate to the bone marrow; and the lack of similarity of non-cancer effects to other known human myeloleukemogens, particularly the absence of pancytopenia in humans or laboratory animals exposed to high levels. However, both of these arguments have been addressed by the recent finding of a pancytopenic effect and chromosomal abnormalities in heavily exposed Chinese workers which, if replicated, are indicative of a genotoxic effect of formaldehyde on hematopoietic stem cells that is in keeping with other known human leukemogens. Review of the body of evidence suggests an apparent discrepancy between studies in laboratory animals, which generally fail to show evidence of penetration of formaldehyde into the blood or evidence of blood or bone marrow genotoxicity, and studies of exposed humans in which there tends to be evidence of genotoxicity in circulating blood cells. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is species difference. Another possible explanation is that myeloid precursors within the nasal mucosa may be the site for leukemogenesis. However, chloromas, which are local collections of myeloid tumor cells, are rarely if ever found in the nose. Other proposed mechanisms for formaldehyde leukemogenesis are reviewed, and dose issues at the interface between the epidemiological and hematotoxicological findings are explored.","['Goldstein, Bernard D']",['Goldstein BD'],"['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. bdgold@pitt.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100820,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,"['0 (Disinfectants)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disinfectants/blood/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Formaldehyde/blood/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', '*Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure/adverse effects', 'Latency Period, Psychological', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Nasal Mucosa/drug effects/pathology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Species Specificity']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/10/12 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['0960327110381682 [pii]', '10.1177/0960327110381682 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2011 Jul;30(7):725-35. doi: 10.1177/0960327110381682.

Here we present evidence that Tax undermines the cellular DNA damage response by sequestration of damage response factors. We show by confocal microscopy that Tax forms damage-independent nuclear foci that contain DNA-PK, BRCA1, and MDC1. Tax sequesters MDC1 to chromatin sites distinct from classic ionizing radiation-induced foci. The recruitment of MDC1 is competitive between the two foci. The N-terminal region of Tax is sufficient for foci localization, and the C-terminal half is critical for binding to MDC1 and recruitment of additional response factors. Tax expression and DNA damage response factor recruitment repressed the formation of ionizing radiation-induced Nbs1-containing foci. The Tax-induced ""pseudo"" DNA damage response results in phosphorylation and monoubiquitylation of H2AX, which is ablated by siRNA suppression of MDC1. These data support a model for virus-induced genomic instability in which viral oncogene-induced damage-independent foci compete with normal cellular DNA damage response.","['Belgnaoui, S Mehdi', 'Fryrear, Kimberly A', 'Nyalwidhe, Julius O', 'Guo, Xin', 'Semmes, O John']","['Belgnaoui SM', 'Fryrear KA', 'Nyalwidhe JO', 'Guo X', 'Semmes OJ']","['From the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Cancer Biology and Infectious Disease Research Center, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virgina 23508.', 'From the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Cancer Biology and Infectious Disease Research Center, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virgina 23508.', 'From the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Cancer Biology and Infectious Disease Research Center, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virgina 23508.', 'From the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Cancer Biology and Infectious Disease Research Center, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virgina 23508.', 'From the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Cancer Biology and Infectious Disease Research Center, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virgina 23508.

A major regulator of gene expression is the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which also regulates angiogenesis-related genes, including the protein expression of angioregulatory cytokines. Angiogenesis has been shown to play a role in haematological disorders, and low oxygen tension might thereby influence leukaemogenesis and chemosensitivity in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: We examined the effect of a hypoxic environment (1% O(2)) on in vitro-cultured, primary human AML cells with regard to HIF-1alpha expression, colony formation and cytokine release. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that hypoxic culture conditions increased HIF-1alpha expression in primary AML cells for a majority of the investigated patients when compared to culture at atmospheric (21%) oxygen tension. Hypoxia also increased the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteopontin, as well as several CCL- (CCL3/4/5/7/8) and CXCL-chemokines (CXCL1 and proangiogenic CXCL8) by AML cells. The constitutive release of antiangiogenic CXCL9-11 was not altered by the low oxygen tension. The wide variation between patients as regards the release of the various cytokines persisted during hypoxia. CONCLUSION: Culture of primary AML cells under low oxygen tension induces HIF-1alpha expression and increases the release of several cytokines, including proangiogenic mediators, compared to culture at ambient 21% O(2).","['Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne', 'Bedringsaas, Siv Lise', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Hatfield KJ', 'Bedringsaas SL', 'Ryningen A', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Haematology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100820,France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ecn.2010.0204 [pii]', '10.1684/ecn.2010.0204 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2010 Sep;21(3):154-64. doi: 10.1684/ecn.2010.0204.

The present study aimed to evaluate the above proteins for predicting response and outcome in oral cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. Pre-treatment oral cancer biopsy samples from 39 patients were examined for Mcl-1 and PCNA proteins using immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinico-pathological variables using disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary endpoint. We observed high expression of Mcl-1 in older versus younger patients (p=0.013) and in tobacco chewers+/-alcohol versus smokers+/-alcohol (p=0.037); and PCNA in node-positive versus node-negative tumours (p=0.037). On univariate analysis, high PCNA (p=0.007), Mcl-1 (p=0.050), node positivity (p=0.040) and co-expression of PCNA and Mcl-1 (p=0.008), had a significant impact on DFS. On multivariate analysis, low PCNA/Mcl-1 (p=0.006) co-expressing tumours were associated with improved DFS. Thus our study suggests that in patients undergoing primary radiotherapy, PCNA could be of potential predictive value to identify patients with risk of nodal metastases and in combination with Mcl-1 may have potential prognostic value to differentiate patients with poor DFS. These markers may be used for future trial patients requiring radiotherapy for their treatment.","['Mallick, Sanchita', 'Agarwal, Jaiprakash', 'Kannan, Sadhana', 'Pawar, Sagar', 'Kane, Shubhada', 'Teni, Tanuja']","['Mallick S', 'Agarwal J', 'Kannan S', 'Pawar S', 'Kane S', 'Teni T']","['Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100821,England,Oral Oncol,Oral oncology,9709118,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1368-8375(10)00140-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.oraloncology.2010.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Oncol. 2010 Sep;46(9):688-93. doi: 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2010.04.003.

Kinase inhibitors (KIs) promised to provide targeted therapy-specifically inhibiting the causal or contributory kinases driving tumor progression while leaving function of other kinases intact. These inhibitors are of 2 general classes: (1) monoclonal antibodies that are typically directed against receptor tyrosine kinases or their ligands and (2) small molecules targeting specific kinases. The latter will be the focus of this review. This class of therapeutics has had some remarkable successes, including revolutionizing the treatment of some malignancies (eg, imatinib [Gleevec] in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia) and adding significantly to the management of other difficult to treat cancers (eg, sunitinib [Sutent] and sorafenib [Nexavar] in the management of renal cell carcinoma). But in some instances, cardiotoxicity, often manifest as left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure, has ensued after the use of KIs in patients.

High-resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis, a nongel-based, automated system, is introduced as a means of mutation scanning without the requirement of any post-PCR handling. METHODS: We studied the sensitivity and reproducibility of LightScanner platform in the detection of JAK2 V617F mutation and the availability for diagnostic use in MPN. RESULTS: The reproducible sensitivity of HRM analysis with LightScanner platform was 5% for the detection of JAK2 V617F mutation. In the test of blind screening of 105 samples (48 Ph- MPN and 57 Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia), the identical judgement was interpreted by two blinded investigators. HRM analysis of all cases was fully concordant with the results of PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: The HRM method developed here is an extremely sensitive, accurate and reliable technique and allows high-throughput, fast pre-screening to select for sequencing only those specimens that most likely contain mutant JAK2 V617F allele(s).","['Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Chen, Qin', 'Xiao, Gao-Fei', 'Ji, Run-Bi', 'Li, Yun', 'Yang, Jing', 'Qian, Zhen']","['Qian J', 'Lin J', 'Yao DM', 'Chen Q', 'Xiao GF', 'Ji RB', 'Li Y', 'Yang J', 'Qian Z']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212002, PR China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100819,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)'],IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis/instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics', 'Time Factors', '*Transition Temperature']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(10)00517-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2010.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2010 Dec 14;411(23-24):2097-100. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2010.08.020.

The inability to undergo apoptosis is an important mechanism of drug resistance and neoplastic evolution in CML. The gene transcript expression of mitochondrial apoptotic related genes BAX and BCL-XL was evaluated by quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) in vitro in K562 cells and in vivo in peripheral blood of 66 CML patients in different stages of the disease: 13 cases at diagnosis, 34 in chronic phase (CP), 10 in accelerated phase (AP) and 9 in blast crisis (BC). Our results in K562 cells showed that all treatments with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induced a decreased expression of the antiapoptotic oncogene BCL-XL, whereas the proapoptotic gene BAX remains constant with minor modifications. A significantly lower BAX/BCL-XL expression ratio (mean+/-SEM) than a group of healthy individuals (4.8+/-0.59) were observed in CML patients at diagnosis (1.28 +/- 0.16), in AP (1.14+/-0.20), in BC (1.16+/-0.30) and in 18% of cases of patients in CP (2.71+/-0.40). Most CP cases (82%) showed a significantly increased ratio (10.03+/-1.30), indicating that the treatment with TKIs efficiently inhibited the expression of BCL-XL by blocking BCR-ABL oncoprotein. The BAX/BCL-XL ratio showed a significant inverse correlation (Spearman P<0.0001) with BCR-ABL/ABL relative expression indicating that low BAX/BCL-XL was associated with disease progression. Accordingly, the follow up of a cohort of eight cases during 6months from diagnosis showed that while the BAX/BCL-XL ratio rapidly increased after treatment in seven cases with good evolution, it decreased in the single case that showed rapid evolution and short survival. Our data suggest that BAX/BCL-XL expression ratio may be a sensitive monitor of disease progression and an early predictor of TKI therapy responsiveness in CML patients.","['Gonzalez, Mariana S', 'De Brasi, Carlos D', 'Bianchini, Michele', 'Gargallo, Patricia', 'Moiraghi, Beatriz', 'Bengio, Raquel', 'Larripa, Irene B']","['Gonzalez MS', 'De Brasi CD', 'Bianchini M', 'Gargallo P', 'Moiraghi B', 'Bengio R', 'Larripa IB']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas Mariano R.

The appearance of particular translocations or associated genomic alterations can be important indicators of disease prognosis, and in some cases, certain translocations may indicate appropriate therapy protocols. To date, most of our knowledge about chromosomal translocations has derived from characterization of the highly selected recurrent translocations found in certain cancers. Until recently, mechanisms that promote or suppress chromosomal translocations, in particular, those responsible for their initiation, have not been addressed. For translocations to occur, two distinct chromosomal loci must be broken, brought together (synapsed) and joined. Here, we discuss recent findings on processes and pathways that influence the initiation of chromosomal translocations, including the generation fo DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by general factors or in the context of the Lymphocyte-specific V(D)J and IgH class-switch recombination processes. We also discuss the role of spatial proximity of DSBs in the interphase nucleus with respect to how DSBs on different chromosomes are justaposed for joining. In addition, we discuss the DNA DSB response and its role in recognizing and tethering chromosomal DSBs to prevent translocations, as well as potential roles of the classical and alternative DSB end-joining pathways in suppressing or promoting translocations. Finally, we discuss the potential roles of long range regulatory elements, such as the 3'IgH enhancer complex, in promoting the expression of certain translocations that are frequent in lymphomas and, thereby, contributing to their frequent appearance in tumors.","['Zhang, Yu', 'Gostissa, Monica', 'Hildebrand, Dominic G', 'Becker, Michael S', 'Boboila, Cristian', 'Chiarle, Roberto', 'Lewis, Susanna', 'Alt, Frederick W']","['Zhang Y', 'Gostissa M', 'Hildebrand DG', 'Becker MS', 'Boboila C', 'Chiarle R', 'Lewis S', 'Alt FW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['5P01 CA92625-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA109901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA109901-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01 CA109901-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P01 CA092625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Immunol,Advances in immunology,0370425,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, RAG-1', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3073861,['NIHMS249944'],2010/08/24 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0065-2776(10)06004-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-2776(10)06004-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Immunol. 2010;106:93-133. doi: 10.1016/S0065-2776(10)06004-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitoxantrone, an anthracyclines, is approved as a treatment for worsening MS. However, systematic analyses of its tolerability and effectiveness outside of controlled trials are few. Certain advantages, including easy application and simple monitoring, need to be balanced against its toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To study efficacy, tolerability and feasibility of mitoxantrone treatment in a regular clinical setting. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from 96 MS patients with worsening MS before, during, and after mitoxantrone. Specifically, we addressed adherence and reasons for deviations from the intended treatment schedule regarding tolerability and safety, and consequences of deviations on clinical efficacy. RESULTS: Schedule deviations were frequent. Only a third of patients received the intended cumulative dose. Hematological toxicity was generally mild and transient. In 7 patients, treatment was withheld because of impact on ventricular ejection fraction, in the absence of clinical symptoms of cardiac failure. No malignancies were observed. With respect to clinical benefit, most patients remained stable and the relapse rate decreased with mitoxantrone initiation in both relapsing and secondary MS patients (p<0.0001). A possible modest non-significant dose-effect on annualized relapse rates was observed. CONCLUSION: Mitoxantrone may be considered for treatment of refractory MS. Poor tolerability impacted adherence but dose-limiting safety events were rare. Mitoxantrone needs to be carefully assessed in light of recent data on risk of cardiotoxicity and leukemia.","['Wundes, Annette', 'Kraft, George H', 'Bowen, James D', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Nash, Richard A']","['Wundes A', 'Kraft GH', 'Bowen JD', 'Gooley TA', 'Nash RA']","['University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195-6465, USA. awundes@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],['N01-AI-05408/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100819,Netherlands,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,7502039,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2009/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0303-8467(10)00232-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clineuro.2010.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 2010 Dec;112(10):876-82. doi: 10.1016/j.clineuro.2010.07.018.

We describe a cohort of 23 Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) patients and 89 additional cases from the English literature for whom biologic features were described. We initially compared our 23 patients to the 89 cases from the literature. Our population had significantly less patients with prior history of polycythemia vera (PV), shorter time from MPN diagnosis to blastic transformation, <3 prior therapies, more frequent use of hydroxyurea and erythropoietin and less frequent use of alkylating agents. Interestingly, the overall survival of the two cohorts from the time of blastic transformation was similar. We therefore looked at the outcome of the entire cohort (n=112). Patients with prior history of essential thrombocythemia survived longer than patients with prior history of myelofibrosis or PV. Further, patients with <3 prior therapies, those who lacked complex karyotype and those <60 year old at MPN diagnosis had significantly longer survival. Among the PRCI population, 20/23 patients underwent induction treatment with cytarabine and an anthracycline containing regimens; 12 achieved remission and their overall survival was significantly longer than those who did not.

Its expression detected in a number of malignancies, including B-cell lymphomas, may be important for oncogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our work, we determined the level of cyclin D1 expression in various B-cell lymphomas (i.e., mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma) and compared it with normal B cells. For cyclin D1 level evaluation, the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data was normalized. We tested five reference genes for stability on our sample set and using the three most stable ones (YWHAZ, ubiquitin c, and HPRT) obtained rather small intra-group variance for cyclin D1 expression in most lymphomas. This allowed their statistically significant ranking according to cyclin D1 expression level. RESULTS: Median values of normalized cyclin D1 expression determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were 1.32 for mantle cell lymphoma, 0.02 for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 0.009 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 0.004 for marginal zone lymphoma, 0.002 for follicular lymphoma compared with 0.0003 for reactive lymphoid tissue, and 0.00004 for sorted B cells of healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that mantle cell lymphoma, a lymphoma with t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, has the level of cyclin D1 increased by four orders of magnitude, while other B-cell lymphomas without t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation still have the level of cyclin D1 significantly elevated above that of normal lymphocytes (2 orders for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and an order for other lymphomas) and suggests more than one method of its upregulation in malignant B cells.","['Gladkikh, Aleena', 'Potashnikova, Daria', 'Korneva, Elena', 'Khudoleeva, Olga', 'Vorobjev, Ivan']","['Gladkikh A', 'Potashnikova D', 'Korneva E', 'Khudoleeva O', 'Vorobjev I']","['Laboratory of Functional Morphology of Hematoblastoses, National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia. aleena_gladkikh@mail.ru']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100818,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)'],IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00366-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Nov;38(11):1047-57. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.08.002.

METHODS: The expression of Bmi-1 was detected in 25 NSCLC tissues as well as in the normal paracancerous lung tissues by immunofluorescence technique and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Immunofluorescently, the positive expression of Bmi-1 proteins was revealed in nucleus of tumor cells in 76%(19 /25) of NSCLC tissue but not in paracancerous lung tissues. RT-PCR results showed that the expression of Bmi-1 in lung cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in paracancerous lung tissues (P<0.05).

It presents in three clinical settings: classical Sweet's syndrome, usually after a respiratory tract infection; malignancy-associated, frequently related to acute myelogeneous leukemia; and drug-induced. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a rotavirus -infection-related Sweet's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-month-old boy of Hellenic origin was referred to us with diarrhea, fever, neutrophilia, typical skin lesions, asymmetrical hip arthritis and oropharyngeal involvement. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Thorough screening did not reveal any underlying systemic illness, except for the confirmation of an overt rotavirus infection. The syndrome responded promptly upon corticosteroid administration; no recurrence was observed. CONCLUSION: Besides describing the connection of Sweet's syndrome to a rotavirus infection, this case report is also a reminder that in a child presenting with a febrile papulo-nodular rash with neutrophilia Sweet's syndrome should be included in the differential.","['Makis, Alexandros', 'Stavrou, Stavros', 'Chaliasos, Nikolaos', 'Zioga, Aikaterini', 'Vlahos, Antonios P', 'Gaitanis, Georgios', 'Siamopoulou, Antigone', 'Bassukas, Ioannis D']","['Makis A', 'Stavrou S', 'Chaliasos N', 'Zioga A', 'Vlahos AP', 'Gaitanis G', 'Siamopoulou A', 'Bassukas ID']","['Child Health Department, University of Ioannina Medical School, P,O, Box 1187, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece. amakis@cc.uoi.gr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100820,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC2933635,,2010/08/24 06:00,2010/08/24 06:01,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-4-281 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-4-281 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2010 Aug 20;4:281. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-4-281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper a novel Monte Carlo score-test methodology is used to assess the statistical power of cohort, ecological and case-control study designs, using the linear low-dose part of the BEIR V model derived from the Japanese data. With 10 (or 20) years of follow-up of childhood leukemias in Great Britain, giving about 4600 (or 9200) cases, under an individual-based cohort design there is 67.9% (or 90.9%) chance of detecting an excess (at 5% significance level, one-sided test); little difference is made by extreme heterogeneity in risk. For an ecological design these figures reduce to 57.9% (or 83.2%). Case-control studies with five controls per case achieve much of the power of a cohort design, 61.1% (or 86.0%). However, participation bias may seriously affect studies that require individual consent, and area-based studies are subject to severe interpretational problems. For this reason register-based studies, in particular those that make use of predicted doses that avoid the need for interviews, have considerable advantages. We argue that previous studies have been underpowered (all have power <80%), and some are also subject to unquantifiable biases and confounding. Sufficiently large studies should be capable of detecting the predicted risk attributable to natural background radiation.","['Little, M P', 'Wakeford, R', 'Lubin, J H', 'Kendall, G M']","['Little MP', 'Wakeford R', 'Lubin JH', 'Kendall GM']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom. mark.little@nih.gov']",['eng'],['ZIA CP010131-18/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['*Background Radiation', 'Child', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology']",PMC3967863,['NIHMS533862'],2010/08/24 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR2110.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2010 Sep;174(3):387-402. doi: 10.1667/RR2110.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on the effect of protons on telomere maintenance, as involved in genomic stability, are scarce and contradictory. Here we demonstrate that high-LET protons induce telomere lengthening in human primary fibroblasts and that this elongation does not involve the telomerase enzyme, supporting the hypothesis that high-LET radiations are able to activate a telomerase-independent mechanism. In tumor cells that lack telomerase, one or more non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance are present, which are termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Since ALT cells are characterized by recombinational events at telomeres, known as telomeric-sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE), and colocalization of telomeres and premyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), we analyzed both T-SCE and PML. Our results show that high-LET protons induce a 2.5-fold increase of T-SCE and a colocalization of PML protein and telomeric DNA. Furthermore, our data show that the ALT pathway can be activated in human primary cells after induction of severe DNA damage. Thus, since telomeres are known to be involved in chromosome maintenance, the present work may contribute in the elucidation of the mechanism by which ionizing radiation induces genomic instability.","['Berardinelli, F', 'Antoccia, A', 'Cherubini, R', 'De Nadal, V', 'Gerardi, S', 'Cirrone, G A P', 'Tanzarella, C', 'Sgura, A']","['Berardinelli F', 'Antoccia A', 'Cherubini R', 'De Nadal V', 'Gerardi S', 'Cirrone GA', 'Tanzarella C', 'Sgura A']","['Dip Di Biologia, Universita Roma Tre, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100730,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Linear Energy Transfer', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport/radiation effects', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/radiation effects', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR2127.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2010 Nov;174(5):539-49. doi: 10.1667/RR2127.1.

Treatment with adjuvant imatinib following surgical resection of localized Kit-positive GIST, the most recent FDA-approved indication (December 2008), has been shown to significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with surgical resection alone. Although adjuvant imatinib has proven effective in clinical trials, it is important to consider the economic impact to health plans of introducing imatinib in accordance with its new labeled indication. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the budgetary impact over a 3-year time horizon of treating patients with localized Kit-positive GIST with 1 year of adjuvant imatinib following surgical resection. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict patients' transitions across health states defined by initial treatment (surgical resection followed by adjuvant imatinib 400 milligrams [mg] daily versus surgical resection alone), recurrence, and progression. Treatments for a first recurrence were (a) imatinib 400 mg daily for recurrences following resection only or after completion of 1 year of treatment with imatinib 400 mg daily and (b) imatinib 800 mg daily for recurrence during active treatment with imatinib 400 mg daily. Treatments for further progression were imatinib 800 mg daily, sunitinib, or best supportive care (BSC) following imatinib 400 mg per day, and sunitinib or BSC following imatinib 800 mg daily. Recurrence rates were derived from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z9001 clinical trial, which compared 1 year of adjuvant imatinib following surgical resection with surgical resection only. The total number of patients with localized and surgically resected GIST (incidence rate of 0.36 per 100,000) was estimated from epidemiologic studies of GIST. Uptake of treatment with imatinib was estimated from unpublished data from qualitative market research funded by the study sponsor. The uptake rate assumptions reflected both (a) the percentage of patients with Kitpositive disease and (b) the percentage of clinically eligible patients who would use imatinib. Costs were estimated by combining unit costs from published sources with expected resource utilization based on the clinical trial publication and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on the treatment of patients with GIST. To obtain estimates of the budgetary impact, we compared estimated health care costs with versus without adjuvant imatinib, where health care costs with imatinib reflected the costs of treatment minus cost offsets associated with delayed or avoided recurrence or progression. All ""with"" scenarios assumed no additional uses other than surgically resected localized Kit-positive GIST (i.e., no change in off-label use of imatinib). The budgetary impact was estimated for the first 3 years after the introduction of adjuvant imatinib in accordance with its new labeled indication in a hypothetical plan population of 10 million persons. Results were calculated both as total budgetary impact and as per member per month (PMPM) cost in 2009 dollars. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of model results to changes in parameter estimates. RESULTS: The model predicted 36 incident resected GIST cases per year in a health plan of 10 million members. The estimated counts of cases treated with adjuvant imatinib were 10.8, 16.2, and 21.6 in the first, second, and third years after introduction, respectively, with the annual increases attributable to changes in the proportion of patients with resected GIST assumed to use imatinib (30% in year 1, rising to 45% in year 2 and 60% in year 3). The model predicted that treatment of these cases with imatinib will increase pharmacy costs by an additional $505,144 in the first year, $757,717 in the second year, and $1,010,289 in the third year. Increased resource use associated with monitoring patients during and after treatment with adjuvant imatinib would cost an additional $21,564, $38,145, and $56,605 in the first, second, and third years, respectively. Recurrence would be avoided or delayed in 7 patients over the 3-year period. Avoided or delayed recurrences would result in cost offsets of $61,583 in the first year, $156,702 in the second year, and $233,849 in the third year. The net budgetary impact was estimated to be $465,126 in the first year (less than $0.01 PMPM), $639,159 in the second year ($0.01 PMPM), and $833,044 in the third year ($0.01 PMPM). Results of sensitivity analyses indicated that the budgetary impact in the third year is most sensitive to changes in the price of adjuvant imatinib and recurrence rates. CONCLUSIONS: The model predicted that the introduction of adjuvant imatinib for treatment of surgically resected, localized, Kit-positive GIST will lead to a net budgetary impact of $0.01 PMPM in the third year after introduction assuming change in use only in accordance with the new labeled indication. Approximately 11.7%-21.9% of the cost of adjuvant imatinib is offset by the reduction in costs associated with GIST recurrence.","['Rubin, Jaime L', 'Taylor, Douglas C A', 'Sanon, Myrlene', 'Coombs, John H', 'Bollu, Vamsi K']","['Rubin JL', 'Taylor DC', 'Sanon M', 'Coombs JH', 'Bollu VK']","['Health Outcomes, i3 Innovus, 10 Cabot Road, Medford, MA, USA.

In addition, we have identified the small molecule inhibitor sorafenib as a potent inhibitor of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA and its T674I imatinib resistant mutant. Sorafenib was originally developed as a BRAF inhibitor, but our work demonstrates that sorafenib can also be used to treat FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive leukemia, demonstrating that new therapies to treat rare leukemias may be simply found by testing drugs that are already in use for the treatment of other diseases. Finally, using genome-wide screening approaches, we have identified the MYB gene as a novel oncogene implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, and we suggest that MYB may represent a novel target for therapy in T-ALL as well as in other cancers.","['Cools, J']",['Cools J'],"['Center for Human Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, K.U.Leuven, Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB - Gasthuisberg O&N1, Herestraat 49 - B 3000 Leuven.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Belgium,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg,Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie,0413210,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Benzenesulfonates/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*genetics/therapy', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Sorafenib', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",,,2010/08/24 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg. 2010;72(1-2):55-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point mutations of the N-RAS gene are the most frequent somatic mutations causing aberrant signal-transduction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of the present work is to study the frequency and prognostic significance of N-RAS gene mutations (N-RASmut) in de novo Egyptian adult AML. Bone marrow specimens from 150 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia and controls were analyzed by genomic PCR-SSCP at codons 12, 13 (exon 1), and 61 (exon 2) for N-RAS mutations. In 12.7% (19/150) AML cases, N-RAS gene mutations were found and were observed more frequently in the FAB subtype M4eo (P = 0.028) and with codon 12, 13 (14 of 19; 73.7%). Patients with N-RAS mutation had a significant lower peripheral and marrow blasts (P = 0.004, P = 0.03) and clinical outcome did not improve more than in patients without mutation. In patients with N-RAS gene mutation vs. those without, complete remission rate was (63.2% vs. 56.5%; P = 0.46), resistant disease (15.8% vs. 23.6%; P = 0.51), three years overall survival (44% vs 42%; P= 0.85) and disease free survival (42.1% vs. 38.9%, P = 0.74). Multivariate analysis showed that age was the strongest unfavorable factor for overall survival (relative risk [RR], 1.9; P = 0.002), followed by cytogenetics (P = 0.004). FAB types, N-RAS mutation and leukocytosis were the least important. In conclusion, the frequency and spectrum of N-RAS gene mutation differ between biologically distinct subtypes of AML but do not significantly influence prognosis and clinical outcome in patients with AML.","['Elghannam, Doaa M', 'Abousamra, Nashwa Khayrat', 'Shahin, Doaa A', 'Goda, Enas F', 'Azzam, Hanan', 'Azmy, Emad', 'El-Din, Manal Salah', 'El-Refaei, Mohamed F']","['Elghannam DM', 'Abousamra NK', 'Shahin DA', 'Goda EF', 'Azzam H', 'Azmy E', 'El-Din MS', 'El-Refaei MF']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Point Mutation', 'Survival Rate']",,,2009/01/01 00:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/08/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2009;16(1):9-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of tumor-associated CNAs was determined after comparison of matched Dx/R samples using stringent conditions able to reduce the number of false positive CNAs. With the exception of a single outlier case, a low number of CNAs per patient was detected (median value of 1 somatic loss or gain per patient). However, a high prevalence of CNAs (60-70% of the patients showed at least one tumor-associated gain or loss) and few recurring CNAs were observed, thus providing new hints towards identification of cooperating mutations. An extensive search of all tumor-associated CN-LOH regions >1 Mb revealed only three broad regions (terminal 12Mb of 22q, terminal 27Mb of 1p and the whole chromosome 21) in three patients out of 19 (16%). CN-LOH of the whole chromosome 21 was responsible for homozygosity of a missense mutation (R80C) of RUNX1/AML1. Our study suggests that a relative submicroscopic copy number stability NK-AML genomes is associated with low recurrence of specific CNAs and CN-LOH in NK-AML patient population. Sequencing of candidate genes in the identified CNAs and CN-LOH regions should be considered a priority in the search of novel driver mutations of AML.","['Barresi, Vincenza', 'Romano, Alessandra', 'Musso, Nicolo', 'Capizzi, Carmela', 'Consoli, Carla', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Condorelli, Daniele F']","['Barresi V', 'Romano A', 'Musso N', 'Capizzi C', 'Consoli C', 'Martelli MP', 'Palumbo G', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Condorelli DF']","['Laboratorio sui Sistemi Complessi, Scuola Superiore di Catania, Universita di Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20810 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Nov;49(11):1014-23. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20810.,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paired chronic-blast phase sample analysis was possible in 26 cases. Nine novel heterozygous LNK mutations were identified in eight (13%) patients: six exon 2 missense mutations involving codons 215, 220, 223, 229 and 234, a synonymous mutation involving codon 208, and two deletion mutations involving exon 2 (685-691_delGGCCCCG) or exon 5 (955_delA); eight affected the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Mutations were detected in six (9.8%) blast-phase samples; chronic-phase sample analysis in four of these revealed the same mutation in one. Mutant LNK was detected in chronic-phase only in two patients and in both chronic-blast phases in one. JAK2V617F was documented in three and IDH2R140Q in one LNK-mutated patients. LNK mutations were not detected in 78 additional patients with chronic-phase MPN enriched for TET2, IDH, JAK2V617F, or MPL-mutated cases. We conclude that LNK mutations (i) target an exon 2 'hot spot' in the PH domain spanning residues E208-D234, (ii) might be more prevalent in blast-phase PMF and (iii) are not mutually exclusive of other MPN-associated mutations but rarely occur in their presence in chronic-phase disease.","['Pardanani, A', 'Lasho, T', 'Finke, C', 'Oh, S T', 'Gotlib, J', 'Tefferi, A']","['Pardanani A', 'Lasho T', 'Finke C', 'Oh ST', 'Gotlib J', 'Tefferi A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. pardanani.animesh@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Murine loss-of-function studies have shown an essential role for Mll in developing the haematopoietic system, yet studies using different conditional knockout models have yielded conflicting results regarding the requirement for Mll during adult steady-state haematopoiesis. In this study, we used a loxP-flanked Mll allele (Mll(F)) and a developmentally regulated, haematopoietic-specific VavCre transgene to reassess the consequences of Mll loss in the haematopoietic lineage, without the need for inducers of Cre recombinase. We show that VavCre;Mll mutants exhibit phenotypically normal fetal haematopoiesis, but rarely survive past 3 weeks of age. Surviving animals are anemic, thrombocytopenic and exhibit a significant reduction in bone marrow haematopoietic stem/progenitor populations, consistent with our previous findings using the inducible Mx1Cre transgene. Furthermore, the analysis of VavCre mutants revealed additional defects in B-lymphopoiesis that could not be assessed using Mx1Cre-mediated Mll deletion. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that Mll has an essential role in sustaining postnatal haematopoiesis.","['Gan, T', 'Jude, C D', 'Zaffuto, K', 'Ernst, P']","['Gan T', 'Jude CD', 'Zaffuto K', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Genetics, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 RR016437/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090036/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090036-02S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016437-076899/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20RR016437/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090036-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL090036/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100819,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Integrases/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/*physiology', 'Transgenes/physiology']",PMC2954260,['NIHMS220068'],2010/08/21 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010171 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.171 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1732-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.171.

The product of this genetic aberration, the PML/RARA fusion protein, is highly oncogenic and supports malignant transformation and growth of hematopoietic precursor cells at the promyelocytic stage of differentiation. Successful treatment of APL by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide (ATO) depends on the ability of these drugs to induce proteolytic degradation of this chimeric protein. In a recently published study we demonstrate that PML/RARA is amenable for degradation by autophagy and that ATRA- and ATO-induced PML/RARA degradation is autophagy-dependent. Consequently, autophagic degradation regulates basal turnover as well as therapy-induced elimination of this oncoprotein. In addition, our study reveals an important role of autophagy in promoting granulocytic differentiation of APL cells.","['Boe, Stig Ove', 'Simonsen, Anne']","['Boe SO', 'Simonsen A']","['Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience (CMBN) and Institute of Medical Microbiology, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, and Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. stig.ove.boe@rr-research.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101019,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['13066 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.6.7.13066 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2010 Oct;6(7):964-5. doi: 10.4161/auto.6.7.13066.

We analyzed 55 patients with hematological neoplasms by using this microarray. In 33 patients with apparent normal conventional cytogenetic analysis, aneuploidy or isochromosomes were detected in 12% (4 of 33) of the patients by aCGH. The chromosomal changes included trisomy of chromosomes 10, 14, and 15, tetrasomy 11, and isochromosome 17q. In 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were initially investigated by using a panel of standard fluorescence in situ hybridization probes, additional copy number changes that were not interrogated by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel were detected in 47% (8 of 17) of the patients by aCGH. Important copy number changes included gain on 2p16 involving REL and BCL11A genes, rearrangements of chromosomes 8 and 15, and trisomy of chromosomes 19 and 22. In five patients with known abnormal karyotypes, aCGH identified the origin of two marker chromosomes and detected microdeletions at five breakpoints involved in three apparent balanced translocations. Our results suggest that a subset of potentially significant genomic alterations is missed by the currently available cytogenetic techniques.

However, the target genes that mediate these antileukemia activities are still poorly understood. In this study, we identified olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), a myeloid-lineage-specific gene from the olfactomedin family, as a novel target gene for RAs and the demethylation agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. We demonstrated that the retinoic acid receptor alpha/retinoic X receptor alpha heterodimer binds to a retinoic acid response-element (DR5) site in the OLFM4 promoter and mediates all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced transactivation of the OLFM4 gene. OLFM4 overexpression in HL-60 cells led to growth inhibition, differentiation, and apoptosis, and potentiated ATRA induction of these effects. Conversely, down-regulation of endogenous OLFM4 in acute myeloid leukemia-193 cells compromised ATRA-induced growth inhibition, differentiation, and apoptosis. Overexpression of OLFM4 in HL-60 cells inhibited constitutive and ATRA-induced phosphorylation of the eukaryote initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), whereas down-regulation of OLFM4 protein in acute myeloid leukemia-193 cells increased 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, suggesting that OLFM4 is a potent upstream inhibitor of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation/deactivation. Thus, our study demonstrates that OLFM4 plays an important role in myeloid leukemia cellular functions and induction of OLFM4-mediated effects may contribute to the therapeutic value of ATRA.","['Liu, Wenli', 'Lee, Hyun Woo', 'Liu, Yueqin', 'Wang, Ruihong', 'Rodgers, Griffin P']","['Liu W', 'Lee HW', 'Liu Y', 'Wang R', 'Rodgers GP']","['Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100819,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (OLFM4 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Response Elements/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC3012588,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60258-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-246439 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Dec 2;116(23):4938-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-246439.

An eight-month-old infant has been hospitalized for acute leukaemia. She developed an extensive painful macule in the buttocks and perineal area in a septic context. A multidisciplinary management allowed to set up an adapted antibiotherapy, an early escharrotomy, a protection of the wound by digestive and urine derivation and a reconstruction with wound healing by second intention and split thickness skin graft, which lead to a good quality cure and wound healing at the end of 37 days of evolution. This case demonstrates the importance of the surgical management in the treatment of ecthyma gangrenosum. The wound healing associated with a split thickness skin graft seems to be the less invasive solution in a frail patient and the fastest to re-start the chemotherapy.","['Gonnelli, D', 'Degardin, N', 'Guidicelli, T', 'Londner, J', 'Magalon, G', 'Bardot, J']","['Gonnelli D', 'Degardin N', 'Guidicelli T', 'Londner J', 'Magalon G', 'Bardot J']","['Service de chirurgie plastique, reconstructrice et esthetique, hopital de la Conception, 147, boulevard Baille, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France. davidgonnelli@hotmail.com']",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20100817,France,Ann Chir Plast Esthet,Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,8305839,,IM,"['Ecthyma/*pathology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Gangrene/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', ""Physician's Role"", 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*methods']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0294-1260(10)00093-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anplas.2010.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Chir Plast Esthet. 2012 Aug;57(4):405-8. doi: 10.1016/j.anplas.2010.07.008.

In the current study, we determined the mRNA and protein expression of DNMT1 in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, after incubation with Lfcin B, by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis. The results of real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that DNMT1 expression in Jurkat T-leukemia cells was reduced after treatment with Lfcin B, and Lfcin B reduced the half-life of DNMT1 mRNA from approximately 8 to 2h. The results of Western blot analysis showed that the expression of DNMT1 protein was down-modulated by Lfcin B in Jurkat T-leukemia cells.

Following the development of cytogenetics, multiple reproducible chromosome aberrations have been discovered in AML, many of which not only are diagnostic markers for specific AML subtypes but also significant prognostic factors for determining complete remission (CR), relapse risk, and overall survival (OS). However, with the foundation of available chromosome analysis, a large group of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 40% to 49% of adults and 25% of children had not been found abnormality of chromosome karyotype under microscope. These so-called cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients have usually been classified in an intermediate-risk prognostic category. Nevertheless, the outcome of the CN-AML patients are varied in clinical studies, likely because there exist diverse gene mutations in these patients according to recent researches. Those mutations at the molecular level, on basis of which AML could be further classified, are significantly associated with CN-AML patients and offer potential targets for specific therapeutic studies.

The growth of DCs was observed by inverted microscope every day; the number of DCs in different groups were counted, the immunophenotypes of DCs were detected by flow cytometry on day 8 of culture. The results indicated that a certain number of typical DCs could be detected in all experimental groups. The DC number in control and 3 test groups were (0.85 +/- 0.23) x 10(5)/L, (2.31 +/- 0.24) x 10(5)/L, (3.26 +/- 0.37) x 10(5)/L and (4.16 +/- 0.34) x 10(5)/L, respectively, among which DC number is in all 3 test groups were higher than that in control group (p < 0.01), the DC number in test group 1 was lower than that in test groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.01), while it in test group 3 was higher than that in test group 2 (p < 0.01).

DCs and CIK cells were induced from cord blood mononuclear cells. They were co-cultured at the ratio of 1:5, and CIK cells from cord blood or DC-CIK cells from peripheral blood were cultured as controls. Immunophenotypic changes were analyzed by flow cytometry, increased number of cells were counted by trypan-blue staining, the killing activity to leukemia cells was assayed by MTT, the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the cultured supernatant were detected by ELISA.

It is concluded that the proliferation capability and anti-leukemia effect of the homologous CIK cells can be enhanced by cord blood DCs. The proliferation capability of cord blood DC-CIK cells is stronger than that of peripheral blood DC-CIK cells, but there is no significant differences of cytotoxicity between DCs and CIK cells.

The effect of TPL on apc gene methylation of Jurkat cells was analyzed by nested methylation specific PCR; the expressions of apc gene, dnnt3a, dnmt3b mRNA were measured by RT-PCR; the protein expression of apc gene was detected by Western blot. The results showed that as compared with untreated control cells, the TPL of different concentrations could significantly inhibit growth and proliferation of Jurkat cells in dose-and time-dependent manners with IC(5)(0) 19.7 ng/ml at 48 hours. All cytosines in CpG dinucleotides in untreated Jurkat cells had no changed, while all cytosines in Jurkat cells treated with TPL had been converted to thymidine suggesting the methylation of apc gene in Jurkat cells. The TPL could reverse hypermethylation of apc gene and induced the mRNA and protein expression of apc gene in dose-dependent manner. It is concluded that the small dose of TPL can obviously suppress the proliferation of Jurkat cells, activate and up-regulate the expression of apc gene through demethylation of apc gene resulting from DNMT and/or direct action, thereby inhibit the proliferation rate of Jurkat cells.","['Wu, Xue-Mei', 'Shen, Jian-Zhen', 'Shen, Song-Fei', 'Fan, Li-Ping']","['Wu XM', 'Shen JZ', 'Shen SF', 'Fan LP']","[""Department of Hematology, Fuzhou Children's Hospital, Fuzhou 350004, Fujian Province, China.""]",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, APC/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)04-0866-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Aug;18(4):866-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of GFI-1 in newly diagnosed patients with leukemia. One pair of oligonucleotide sequences targeted at human gfi-1 mRNA were designed and synthesized. The annealed oligonucleotide fragments were subcloned into pLVTHM vector. Virus particles were collected when the control and shRNA vectors had been co-transfected with the psPAX2 packaging plasmid and the envelope plasmid pMD2 G into HEK-293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The K562 cells were transfused with 1 x 10(6) recombinant lentivirus-transfusing units plus 6 microg/ml of polybrene. Rea-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of gfi-1 and bax mRNA after lentivirus transfusion. CCK-8 assays was used to evaluate the proliferation potential of cells. The results showed that the gfi-1 expression level in all leukemia patients was significantly higher than that in normal group (p < 0.05); the gfi-1 mRNA expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients was significantly higher than that in normal group (p < 0.05); but the difference of gfi-1 mRNA expression between AL and CML or ALL and AML was not significant. Notably, the gfi-1 mRNA expression level had a positive correlation with high white blood cell count of > 20.0 x 10(9)/L (p < 0.05). As was expected, the mRNA and protein level of gfi-1 was reduced significantly in K562 cells after lentivirus transfusion, whereas the mRNA and protein level of bax was upregulated. And CCK-8 assay showed that gfi-1 gene silencing can inhibit K562 proliferation. It is concluded that gfi-1 expression is upregulated in leukemia patients and may contribute to leukemogenesis. The gfi-1 specific shRNA mediated by lentivirus can effectively down-regulate the expression of gfi-1 and inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells, which lay a basis for further research on gene therapy in leukemia.","['Zhan, Rong', 'Wu, Shun-Quan', 'Huang, Hao-Bo', 'Huang, Shen-Lin', 'Lin, Jun']","['Zhan R', 'Wu SQ', 'Huang HB', 'Huang SL', 'Lin J']","['Department of Hematoloy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, Fujian Province, China. deanzhanrong@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (PHB2 protein, human)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmids', 'Prohibitins', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)04-0849-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Aug;18(4):849-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The puma mRNA expressions in 100 CLL patients and 11 normal controls were measured by relative quantification RT-PCR with fluorescent dye SYBR Green I, the beta-actin was used as internal reference. The difference of puma expression rate between groups with different prognostic factors was described using the Mann-Whitney U test. The relative quantitative value of puma expression was calculated by means of 2 (-DeltaCt). The results indicated that the correlation coefficients of the standard curves in qRT-PCR were >/= 0.99. The coefficients of variations (CV) within group or between groups were < 5%, and the sensitivity reached 10(2) copies/microg RNA. The median puma mRNA expression level was 1.038 x 10(-)(3) (4.106 x 10(-)(4) - 2.806 x 10(-)(3)) in CLL patients, which was 1.220 x 10(-)(3) (7.233 x 10(-)(4) - 1.405 x 10(-)(3)) in normal controls. There was no difference of puma mRNA expression between CLL patients and normal controls (U = 544.5, p = 0.957). Puma expression was significantly correlated with Binet stages (p < 0.001), expression of CD38 (p = 0.002), ZAP-70 protein (p = 0.012), LDH levels (p = 0.009) and beta(2)-MG (p = 0.046). The puma expression level in patients with earlier Binet stage (Binet stage A) was obviously higher than that in patients with later Binet stage (Binet stage B, C). The puma expression levels in patients with positive expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 protein, elevating levels of LDH and beta(2)-MG were sharply lower than those in patients without above-mentioned unfavorable factors. The puma expression was also correlated with molecular cytogenetic abnormalities, the puma expression levels in patients with trisomy 12 (p = 0.003) and 14q32 translocation (p = 0.045) detected by FISH were significantly lower than those in patients without above-mentioned molecular cytogenetic abnormalities. It is concluded that the qRT-PCR assay is reliable and sensitive.

So far, the effect of G-CSF on natural killer (NK) cells has not been fully investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of G-CSF on the phenotype, cytokine secretion profile, and cytotoxicity of NK cells was assessed. NK cells incubated in vitro in presence of G-CSF for 48 hours as well as NK cells isolated from peripheral blood of G-CSF-mobilized stem cell donors (in vivo) were used. RESULTS: In vitro, G-CSF caused a strongly altered phenotype in NK cells with 49% down regulation of NKp44 frequency. Furthermore, the expression of the activating receptors NKp46 and NKG2D decreased 40 and 64%, respectively. The expression of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2 decreased by 46% each. In cytotoxicity assays, the lytic capacity of G-CSF-exposed NK cells is reduced by up to 68% in vitro and up to 83% in vivo. Accordingly, granzyme B levels of in vivo G-CSF-exposed NK cells were reduced by up to 87% in comparison to nonstimulated NK cells. Cytokine production of in vitro and in vivo incubated NK cells was strongly decreased for interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor as well as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in proliferation and a positive feedback loop that increased the expression of the G-CSF receptor. CONCLUSION: G-CSF was demonstrated to be a strong inhibitor of NK cells activity and may prevent their graft-versus-leukemia effect after transplantation.","['Schlahsa, Laura', 'Jaimes, Yarua', 'Blasczyk, Rainer', 'Figueiredo, Constanca']","['Schlahsa L', 'Jaimes Y', 'Blasczyk R', 'Figueiredo C']","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100816,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR2 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Granzymes/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lenograstim', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/pharmacology']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['TRF2820 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02820.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Feb;51(2):293-305. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02820.x.

Dasatinib is indicated for chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib; it has 325-fold increase potency compared to imatinib and is active in mutated and unmutated resistant patients. Pleural/pericardic effusions are frequent complications during treatment with dasatinib, and usually are reported to require dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Changing the dasatinib regimen from 70 mg twice daily to 100 mg once daily reduces the risk of pleural effusions. AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: In this article, we review the incidence of the phenomenon observed in different dasatinib trials (Phase I - III) and the currently suggested management. We also describe the identified pathogenetic mechanisms related to the development and discuss the associated risk factors. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The aim of this paper is to provide healthcare professionals with clear guidance on the management of pleural effusions associated with dasatinib treatment. Recommendations are based on the published data and clinical experience from a number of different centers. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Literature evidences support the fact that with adequate management and monitoring of patients with predisposing factors, pleural effusions can be easily managed.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G']","['Sapienza University, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Comorbidity', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hypercholesterolemia/epidemiology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Pericardial Effusion/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects', 'Pleural Effusion/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/21 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/08/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740331003742935 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2010 Sep;9(5):713-21. doi: 10.1517/14740331003742935.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The context is that of dose-finding designs where certain design parameters are fixed by the investigator. Although our focus is on the CRM (O'Quigley et al., 1990), the essential ideas can be applied to any sequential dose-finding method. It is expected that different choices of a model family and particular parameterizations will have an impact on performance. Assuming that the constraints outlined in Shen and O'Quigley (1996) are respected, large sample performance is unaffected. However small sample performance will be affected by these choices, which are to some degree arbitrary. This work focuses on the retrospective robustness of the CRM in practice. The question is not of a general theoretical nature where, in the background, we would want to consider large numbers of true potential situations. Instead, the question is raised in the specific context of any actual completed study and is the following: Would we have come to the same conclusion concerning the MTD had we worked with a design specified differently? The sequential nature of the CRM means that this question cannot be answered in any definitive way. We can, though, by appealing to the retrospective CRM (O'Quigley, 2005), provide consistent estimates of the relationships between the MTD and the chosen model. If these estimates suggest that changes in different family model parameters will be accompanied by changes in final recommendation, then we would not be confident in the reliability of the estimated MTD and more work would be needed. Also, of course, at the planning stage, prospective robustness could be studied by simulating trials using particular models and parameterizations.","[""O'Quigley, John"", 'Zohar, Sarah']","[""O'Quigley J"", 'Zohar S']","['Inserm, University Paris 6, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Biopharm Stat,Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,9200436,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Biostatistics/*methods', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Harringtonines/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diet therapy', 'Likelihood Functions', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', '*Models, Statistical', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2010/08/20 06:00,2011/01/15 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['925940619 [pii]', '10.1080/10543400903315732 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biopharm Stat. 2010 Sep;20(5):1013-25. doi: 10.1080/10543400903315732.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chest pain with ECG changes, arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure and sudden death have been described in the literature. CASE STUDY: We report the first case of AMI in a 59-year-old male patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) during chemotherapy with hydroxyurea. The patient was not affected by prior heart disease and did not reveal any classic risk factors for coronary heart disease. Because of the severe thrombocytopenia (23000/mul), no acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or clopidogrel were given but low dose heparin (400 U/h). Urgent coronary angiography revealed complete thrombotic occlusion of the proximal left descending coronary artery. CONCLUSION: This case reveals that AMI can occur during chemotherapy with hydroxyurea in patients without prior heart disease. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains hitherto unclear. Coronary artery spasm, lesions of the endothelium as well as coagulation disorders have been postulated to explain this side effect of hydroxyurea.","['Kalsch, H', 'Wieneke, H', 'Erbel, R']","['Kalsch H', 'Wieneke H', 'Erbel R']","['West German Heart Center Essen, Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

It contains cells that represent the stages in the development of different types of blood cells e.g. myelocytes, metamyelocytes, erythroblasts, reticulocytes, and other lymphoid progenies etc. Bone marrow failure is primarily the result of a specific failure of bone marrow precursor cells to produce mature cells. N-ethyl N-nitroso urea (ENU) is one of the most potent mutagens that can create an abnormal bone marrow microenvironment by causing defect in haematopoietic stem cell maturation cascade. ENU is easy to administer in mouse, and some probable mutations can be helpful to create models of human diseased conditions like Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS is considered as an intravascular bone marrow disorder, a combined structural-functional abnormality wherein the differentiation procedure of the bone marrow stem cell is either incomplete or defective. We assumed that Myelodysplastic syndrome stands in between an inhibitory cellular pattern and a positive overshoot of abnormal differentiations representing an unknown juncture where the mystery of aplasia and leukemia hide back. Instead of using a transgenic mouse model, we attempted to develop an experimentally induced murine model of preleukemia or human MDS like disease model. In doing so ENU has been administered i.p and the animals were examined on thirtieth day and peripheral blood haemogram was documented. Upon registering the appearance of abnormal peripheral blood scenario, the changes in the intravascular bone marrow (BM) architecture, cell surface receptor expression, e.g. Sca-1, c-Kit and the early and late phase apoptic patterns were noted. The results represented an interesting correlation in between bone marrow architecture, early stem cell receptor and apoptic marker expression resembling human MDS.","['Das, Madhurima', 'Chatterjee, Sumanta', 'Basak, Pratima', 'Das, Prosun', 'Pereira, Jacintha Archana', 'Dutta, Ranjan Kumar', 'Chaklader, Malay', 'Chaudhuri, Samaresh', 'Law, Sujata']","['Das M', 'Chatterjee S', 'Basak P', 'Das P', 'Pereira JA', 'Dutta RK', 'Chaklader M', 'Chaudhuri S', 'Law S']","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata-700073, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Stem Cells,Journal of stem cells,101295936,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology']",,,2010/08/20 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jsc.2010.4.4.229 [pii]', 'jsc.2010.4.4.229 [doi]']",ppublish,J Stem Cells. 2009;4(4):229-41. doi: jsc.2010.4.4.229.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IM pharmacokinetics is influenced by several enzymes and transporters, little is known about the role of pharmacogenetic variation in IM metabolism. In this study, associations between IM trough concentration, clinical response and 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in IM pharmacokinetics (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2 CYP3A5, SLC22A1 and SLCO1B3) were investigated among 67 Japanese chronic phase CML patients. IM trough concentration was significantly higher in patients with a major molecular response than in those without one (P=0.010). No significant correlations between IM trough concentration and age, weight, body mass index or biochemical data were observed. However, the dose-adjusted IM trough concentration was significantly higher in patients with ABCG2 421A than in those with 421C/C (P=0.015). By multivariate regression analysis, only ABCG2 421A was independently predictive of a higher dose-adjusted IM trough concentration (P=0.015). Moreover, previous studies have shown that the ABCG2 421C>A (p.Q141K) variant is prevalent among Japanese and Han Chinese individuals and less common among Africans and Caucasians. Together, these data indicate that plasma IM concentration monitoring and prospective ABCG2 421C>A genotyping may improve the efficacy of IM therapy, particularly among Asian CML patients.","['Takahashi, Naoto', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Scott, Stuart A', 'Kagaya, Hideaki', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Tagawa, Hiroyuki', 'Saitoh, Hirobumi', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Hirokawa, Makoto', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Takahashi N', 'Miura M', 'Scott SA', 'Kagaya H', 'Kameoka Y', 'Tagawa H', 'Saitoh H', 'Fujishima N', 'Yoshioka T', 'Hirokawa M', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100819,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', '*Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/20 06:00,2011/03/23 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jhg201098 [pii]', '10.1038/jhg.2010.98 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2010 Nov;55(11):731-7. doi: 10.1038/jhg.2010.98.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyze eight randomized trials of the German Hodgkin's lymphoma study group [5357 individuals, 67 secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 97 secondary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)]. Primary therapies were divided into four groups: radiotherapy alone, moderately dosed COPP/ABVD-like chemotherapies for intermediate and advanced stages and BEACOPP escalated. RESULTS: For secondary AML/MDS, the hazards after primary therapies are proportional (maximum at 3.4 years), while the hazard after relapse therapy is more peaked (maximum at 1.8 years). Intermediate and advanced stage chemotherapy resulted in a cumulative risk of 1.5%, while the risk after BEACOPP escalated is higher (4.4%, P = 0.004) and comparable with that after relapse therapy (4.5%). For secondary NHL, there are no differences in cumulative risk between the primary therapies (2.9%), while the risk after relapse therapy is increased (6.6%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: BEACOPP escalated moderately increases the risk of secondary AML/MDS but not NHL. No differences were found between other chemotherapies of advanced stages and intermediate stages. Secondary AML/MDS occurs faster after relapse treatment than after primary treatment.","['Scholz, M', 'Engert, A', 'Franklin, J', 'Josting, A', 'Diehl, V', 'Hasenclever, D', 'Loeffler, M']","['Scholz M', 'Engert A', 'Franklin J', 'Josting A', 'Diehl V', 'Hasenclever D', 'Loeffler M']","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig; LIFE (Leipzig Interdisciplinary Research Cluster of Genetic Factors, Phenotypes and Environment), University of Leipzig, Leipzig.

Our goals in this study were to determine the impact specific activator-dependent histone acetylation had on chromatin condensation and to ascertain whether acetylation-induced changes in chromatin condensation were related to changes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity. To accomplish this, an in vitro model system was constructed in which the purified transcriptional activators, Tax and phosphorylated CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), recruited the p300 histone acetyltransferase to nucleosomal templates containing the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 promoter sequences. We find that activator-dependent p300 histone acetylation disrupted both inter- and intrafiber nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and simultaneously led to enhanced RNAPII transcription from the decondensed model chromatin. p300 histone acetyltransferase activity had two distinct components: non-targeted, ubiquitous activity in the absence of activators and activator-dependent activity targeted primarily to promoter-proximal nucleosomes. Mass spectrometry identified several unique p300 acetylation sites on nucleosomal histone H3 (H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3K37). Collectively, our data have important implications for understanding both the mechanism of RNAPII transcriptional regulation by chromatin and the molecular determinants of higher order chromatin structure.","['Szerlong, Heather J', 'Prenni, Jessica E', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K', 'Hansen, Jeffrey C']","['Szerlong HJ', 'Prenni JE', 'Nyborg JK', 'Hansen JC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM45916/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM088409/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM088409/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM045916/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM088409-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100818,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC2952196,,2010/08/20 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47244-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.148718 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Oct 15;285(42):31954-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.148718.

The one EBV protein expressed in the nucleus of NPC cells, EBNA1, has been shown to disrupt promyelocitic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) by inducing the degradation of PML proteins, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased cell survival. Although EBNA1-mediated PML disruption is likely to be an important factor in the development of NPC, little is known about its mechanism. We now show that an interaction between EBNA1 and the host CK2 kinase is crucial for EBNA1 to disrupt PML bodies and degrade PML proteins. EBNA1 increases the association of CK2 with PML proteins, thereby increasing the phosphorylation of PML proteins by CK2, a modification that is known to trigger the polyubiquitylation and degradation of PML. The interaction between EBNA1 and CK2 is direct and occurs through the beta regulatory subunit of CK2 and EBNA1 amino acids 387 to 394. The binding of EBNA1 to the host ubiquitin specific protease USP7 has also been shown to be important for EBNA1-mediated PML disruption. We show that EBNA1 also increases the occupancy of USP7 at PML NBs and that CK2 and USP7 bind independently and simultaneously to EBNA1 to form a ternary complex. The combined results indicate that EBNA1 usurps two independent cellular pathways to trigger the loss of PML NBs.","['Sivachandran, Nirojini', 'Cao, Jennifer Yinuo', 'Frappier, Lori']","['Sivachandran N', 'Cao JY', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, 1 Kings College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100818,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Casein Kinase II/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/*physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*pathogenicity', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/etiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7']",PMC2953151,,2010/08/20 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01183-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01183-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Nov;84(21):11113-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01183-10.

However, the mechanisms through which apoptin achieves its selective killing effects are not well understood. We developed a lentiviral vector encoding a green fluorescent protein-apoptin fusion gene (LV-GFP-AP) that can efficiently deliver apoptin into hematopoietic cells. Apoptin selectively killed the human multiple myeloma cell lines MM1.R and MM1.S, and the leukemia cell lines K562, HL60, U937, KG1, and NB4. In contrast, normal CD34(+) cells were not killed and maintained their differentiation potential in multilineage colony formation assays. In addition, dexamethasone-resistant MM1.R cells were found to be more susceptible to apoptin-induced cell death than the parental matched MM1.S cells. Death susceptibility correlated with increased phosphorylation and activation of the apoptin protein in MM1.R cells. Expression array profiling identified differential kinase profiles between MM1.R and MM1.S cells. Among these kinases, protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta) was found by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase studies to be a candidate kinase responsible for apoptin phosphorylation. Indeed, shRNA knockdown or drug-mediated inhibition of PKCbeta significantly reduced apoptin phosphorylation. Furthermore, apoptin-mediated cell death proceeded through the upregulation of PKCbeta, activation of caspase-9/3, cleavage of the PKCdelta catalytic domain, and downregulation of the MERTK and AKT kinases.

Unlike that of other alkylating agents, the leukemogenic potential of temozolomide is considered to be very low, and very rarely are such cases reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old Pakistani man who was treated for glioblastoma with temozolomide in an adjuvant setting was diagnosed to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia one year after stopping temozolomide. CONCLUSION: Temozolomide is a highly active agent, used in the management of high-grade brain neoplasms. The agent is generally regarded to be safe, with an acceptable safety profile. Very few cases of myelodysplasia associated with temozolomide use have been reported. We report here the first case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which developed in a young man about one year after he finished taking temozolomide. This should provide further insight into a possible toxicity profile of this alkylating agent. This finding should be of interest to physicians in general and to medical oncologists in particular.","['Shaikh, Asim Jamal', 'Masood, Nehal']","['Shaikh AJ', 'Masood N']","['Section of Medical Oncology, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. asim.jshaikh@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100818,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC2931525,,2010/08/20 06:00,2010/08/20 06:01,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-4-274 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-4-274 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2010 Aug 18;4:274. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-4-274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of these lesions are benign. However, the interpretation of renal lesions can be problematic if the imaging criteria of simple cysts are not met. Limited literature exists on the characterisation of renal masses with metabolic imaging. The purpose of this article is to focus on the imaging features of benign and malignant renal masses with PET/CT. The lesions discussed include renal cyst, angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, renal metastases and other infiltrating neoplastic processes affecting the kidney. Both the anatomical and metabolic features which characterise these benign and malignant entities are described. We emphasise the importance of viewing the CT component to identify the typical morphological features and discuss how to best use hybrid imaging for management of renal lesions. Metabolic imaging has a promising role in the imaging of renal lesions and can help prevent unnecessary biopsies and ensure optimal management of suspicious lesions.","['Kochhar, R', 'Brown, R K', 'Wong, C O', 'Dunnick, N R', 'Frey, K A', 'Manoharan, P']","['Kochhar R', 'Brown RK', 'Wong CO', 'Dunnick NR', 'Frey KA', 'Manoharan P']","['Department of Radiology, The Christie, NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol,Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,101469340,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Adenoma, Oxyphilic/diagnosis', 'Angiomyolipoma/diagnosis', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*diagnosis', 'Cysts/diagnosis', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Kidney/diagnostic imaging', 'Kidney Diseases/diagnosis', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",,,2010/08/20 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ARA2181 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1754-9485.2010.02181.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol. 2010 Aug;54(4):347-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1754-9485.2010.02181.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are the two most common histologic subtypes of primary thyroid lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) presenting initially as a thyroid abnormality is extremely rare, with very few reported cases in the literature. SUMMARY: We report a case of a patient with a long history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and goiter who presented with a recent enlargement of her thyroid gland. The sonographic finding of a distinct thyroid nodule in the heterogeneous background of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis led to the performance of a fine-needle aspiration biopsy and flow cytometry, with a high index of suspicion for thyroid lymphoma. Subsequent surgical removal of the thyroid gland, prompted by the patient's history of head and neck radiation, confirmed the diagnosis of CLL/SLL. The patient's systemic illness was recognized only after the management of her thyroid disease. Although thyroiditis has long been associated with lymphoma arising in the thyroid gland, CLL/SLL involving the thyroid has not been linked to chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Therefore, the patient also had coexisting thyroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the rarity of thyroid lymphomas, our experience in the detection and management of this disease is limited. Primary thyroid lymphoma should be suspected in a patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis presenting with a rapidly enlarging neck mass. The initial diagnostic method for thyroid lymphoma should consist of a fine-needle aspiration biopsy with the use of ancillary techniques such as flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry for improved diagnostic accuracy. Although controversial, the treatment of thyroid lymphoma is typically guided by the histologic subtype and extent of disease. CLL/SLL is one of the rarest subtypes of lymphoma that can involve the thyroid gland. Diagnosis of this entity is difficult, particularly before the recognition of systemic involvement, requiring the expertise of a multidisciplinary team for early detection and optimal management.","['Shin, Joyce', 'Chute, Deborah', 'Milas, Mira', 'Mitchell, Jamie', 'Siperstein, Allan', 'Berber, Eren']","['Shin J', 'Chute D', 'Milas M', 'Mitchell J', 'Siperstein A', 'Berber E']","['Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Goiter/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Hashimoto Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Ultrasonography']",,,2010/08/20 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/08/20 06:00'],"['2010/08/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2010.0089 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2010 Sep;20(9):1019-23. doi: 10.1089/thy.2010.0089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Bcr-Abl also modulates Skp2 protein stability in these cells. Treatment of Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib led to G1 growth arrest accompanied with reduced Skp2 expression. Interestingly, reduction of Skp2 protein occurred prior to down-regulation of Skp2 mRNA suggesting a post-translational control. The half-life of Skp2 protein was significantly attenuated in imatinib-treated cells. These effects are not cell line specific because similar results were also found in CML cells obtained from patients. Knockdown of Bcr-Abl similarly caused Skp2 protein instability. The decrease of Skp2 was induced by increased protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Imatinib treatment or Bcr-Abl knockdown reduced Emi1, an endogenous inhibitor of the E3 ligase APC/Cdh1 which mediated Skp2 degradation. We found that Emi1 stability was regulated by phosphorylation and mutation of tyrosine 142 reduced the stability. Our data suggested Bcr-Abl-induced Emi1 phosphorylation might be mediated by Src kinase. Firstly, Src inhibitor SU6656 inhibited Emi1 tyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells. Secondly, transfection of v-Src rescued the reduction of Emi1 by imatinib. Thirdly, mutation of tyrosine 142 to phenylalanine (Y142F) abolished the phosphorylation of Emi1 by recombinant Src kinase. In addition, ectopic expression of wild type but not Y142F mutant Emi1 counteracted imatinib-caused growth arrest. Collectively, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl increases Emi1 phosphorylation and stability to prevent Skp2 protein degradation via APC/Cdh1-induced ubiquitination and to enhance proliferation of CML cells.","['Chen, Jing-Yi', 'Wang, Ming-Chung', 'Hung, Wen-Chun']","['Chen JY', 'Wang MC', 'Hung WC']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (FBXO5 protein, human)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*K562 Cells', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,,2010/08/19 06:00,2011/01/07 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22346 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Feb;226(2):407-13. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22346.,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a cancer of blood cells resulting from a malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. The dynamics are given by a system of ordinary differential equations for normal and leukemic cells. Homeostasis regulates the proliferation of normal HSC and leads the dynamics to an equilibrium. This mechanism is partially efficient for leukemic cells. We define homeostasis by a functional of either hematopoietic stem cells, differentiated cells or both cell lines. We determine the number of hematopoietic stem cells and differentiated cells at equilibrium. Conditions for regeneration of hematopoiesis and persistence of CML are obtained from the global asymptotic stability of equilibrium states. We prove that normal and leukemic cells can not coexist for a long time. Numerical simulations illustrate our analytical results.

In Jan/Feb 2010 the authors organised a team of researchers who visited 711 houses in Fallujah, Iraq and obtained responses to a questionnaire in Arabic on cancer, birth defects and infant mortality. The total population in the resulting sample was 4,843 persons with and overall response rate was better than 60%. Relative Risks for cancer were age-standardised and compared to rates in the Middle East Cancer Registry (MECC, Garbiah Egypt) for 1999 and rates in Jordan 1996-2001. Between Jan 2005 and the survey end date there were 62 cases of cancer malignancy reported (RR = 4.22; CI: 2.8, 6.6; p < 0.00000001) including 16 cases of childhood cancer 0-14 (RR = 12.6; CI: 4.9, 32; p < 0.00000001). Highest risks were found in all-leukaemia in the age groups 0-34 (20 cases RR = 38.5; CI: 19.2, 77; p < 0.00000001), all lymphoma 0-34 (8 cases, RR = 9.24;CI: 4.12, 20.8; p < 0.00000001), female breast cancer 0-44 (12 cases RR = 9.7;CI: 3.6, 25.6; p < 0.00000001) and brain tumours all ages (4 cases, RR = 7.4;CI: 2.4, 23.1; P < 0.004). Infant mortality was based on the mean birth rate over the 4 year period 2006-2009 with 1/6th added for cases reported in January and February 2010. There were 34 deaths in the age group 0-1 in this period giving a rate of 80 deaths per 1,000 births. This may be compared with a rate of 19.8 in Egypt (RR = 4.2 p < 0.00001) 17 in Jordan in 2008 and 9.7 in Kuwait in 2008. The mean birth sex-ratio in the recent 5-year cohort was anomalous. Normally the sex ratio in human populations is a constant with 1,050 boys born to 1,000 girls. This is disturbed if there is a genetic damage stress. The ratio of boys to 1,000 girls in the 0-4, 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 age cohorts in the Fallujah sample were 860, 1,182, 1,108 and 1,010 respectively suggesting genetic damage to the 0-4 group (p < 0.01). Whilst the results seem to qualitatively support the existence of serious mutation-related health effects in Fallujah, owing to the structural problems associated with surveys of this kind, care should be exercised in interpreting the findings quantitatively.","['Busby, Chris', 'Hamdan, Malak', 'Ariabi, Entesar']","['Busby C', 'Hamdan M', 'Ariabi E']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine, UK. christo@greenaudit.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100706,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Infant Mortality', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Sex Ratio', 'Weapons', 'Young Adult']",PMC2922729,,2010/08/19 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph7072828 [doi]', 'ijerph7072828 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2010 Jul;7(7):2828-37. doi: 10.3390/ijerph7072828.

This novel spectrum of activity is explained by the non-ATP-competitive inhibition of JAK2 and BCR-ABL kinases. ON044580 inhibits mutant JAK2 kinase and the proliferation of JAK2(V617F)-positive leukemic cells and blocks the IL-3-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5. Interestingly, this compound also directly inhibits the kinase activity of both wild-type and imatinib-resistant (T315I) forms of the BCR-ABL kinase. Finally, ON044580 effectively induces apoptosis of imatinib-resistant CML patient cells. The apparently unrelated JAK2 and BCR-ABL kinases share a common substrate, STAT5, and such substrate competitive inhibitors represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for development of new inhibitors. The novel mechanism of kinase inhibition exhibited by ON044580 renders it effective against mutant forms of kinases such as the BCR-ABL(T315I) and JAK2(V617F). Importantly, ON044580 selectively reduces the number of aneuploid cells in primary bone marrow samples from monosomy 7 MDS patients, suggesting another regulatory cascade amenable to this agent in these aberrant cells. Data presented suggest that this compound could have multiple therapeutic applications including monosomy 7 MDS, imatinib-resistant CML, and myeloproliferative neoplasms that develop resistance to ATP-competitive agents.","['Jatiani, Shashidhar S', 'Cosenza, Stephen C', 'Reddy, M V Ramana', 'Ha, Ji Hee', 'Baker, Stacey J', 'Samanta, Ajoy K', 'Olnes, Matthew J', 'Pfannes, Loretta', 'Sloand, Elaine M', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Reddy, E Premkumar']","['Jatiani SS', 'Cosenza SC', 'Reddy MV', 'Ha JH', 'Baker SJ', 'Samanta AK', 'Olnes MJ', 'Pfannes L', 'Sloand EM', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Reddy EP']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL080666/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL080666-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC2921666,['NIHMS223143'],2010/08/19 06:00,2010/08/19 06:01,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601910371337 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601910371337 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2010 Apr;1(4):331-45. doi: 10.1177/1947601910371337.,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'CMPD', 'JAK2', 'MDS']",,,

ChIP-Seq analysis has recently revealed that MyoD binds to a large number of genomic loci in differentiating myoblasts, yet only activates transcription at a subset of these genes. Here we discuss recent data suggesting that the ability of MyoD to mediate gene expression is regulated through the function of Polycomb and Trithorax Group proteins. Based on studies of the muscle-specific myog gene, we propose a model where the transcriptional activators Mef2d and Six4 mediate recruitment of Trithorax Group proteins Ash2L/MLL2 and UTX to MyoD-bound promoters to overcome the Polycomb-mediated repression of muscle genes. Modulation of the interaction between Ash2L/MLL2 and Mef2d by the p38alpha MAPK signaling pathway in turns provides fine-tuning of the muscle-specific gene expression program. Thus Mef2d, Six4, and p38alpha MAPK function coordinately as regulators of a master regulator to mediate expression of MyoD target genes.","['Aziz, Arif', 'Liu, Qi-Cai', 'Dilworth, F Jeffrey']","['Aziz A', 'Liu QC', 'Dilworth FJ']","['Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, CA.']",['eng'],"['MOP-77778/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-93777/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20101101,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (MADS Domain Proteins)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2D protein, human)', '0 (MYOG protein, human)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (MyoD1 myogenic differentiation protein)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIX4 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genetic Loci/physiology', 'Histone Demethylases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MADS Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', '*Models, Biological', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'MyoD Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myoblasts/metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Myogenin/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity/physiology', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3052885,,2010/08/19 06:00,2011/03/10 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['13045 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.5.8.13045 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2010 Nov-Dec;5(8):691-5. doi: 10.4161/epi.5.8.13045.

In multivariate analysis, the type of conditioning regimen (RIC vs. MAC) was not significantly associated with leukemia-free survival (P = .23, HR = 0.84). Despite the need for randomized trials, we conclude that RIC allo-SCT from a human leukocyte antigen-identical donor is a potential therapeutic option for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients aged >/= 45 years in complete remission and not eligible for MAC allo-SCT.","['Mohty, Mohamad', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Tabrizi, Reza', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Mohty M', 'Labopin M', 'Volin L', 'Gratwohl A', 'Socie G', 'Esteve J', 'Tabrizi R', 'Nagler A', 'Rocha V']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Hotel Dieu, Universite de Nantes, Centre d'Investigation Clinique en Cancerologie and Inserm U892, Nantes, France. mohamad.mohty@univ-nantes.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20100817,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/19 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30998-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-266551 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4439-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-266551.

We have now investigated whether inhibition of BCR signaling with the selective Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) will affect the growth of the leukemias that develop in the Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL. Similarly to human CLL, these leukemias express stereotyped BCRs that react with autoantigens exposed on the surface of senescent or apoptotic cells, suggesting that they are antigen driven. We show that R788 effectively inhibits BCR signaling in vivo, resulting in reduced proliferation and survival of the malignant B cells and significantly prolonged survival of the treated animals. The growth-inhibitory effect of R788 occurs despite the relatively modest cytotoxic effect in vitro and is independent of basal Syk activity, suggesting that R788 functions primarily by inhibiting antigen-dependent BCR signals. Importantly, the effect of R788 was found to be selective for the malignant clones, as no disturbance in the production of normal B lymphocytes was observed. Collectively, these data provide further rationale for clinical trials with R788 in CLL and establish the BCR-signaling pathway as an important therapeutic target in this disease.","['Suljagic, Mirza', 'Longo, Pablo G', 'Bennardo, Sara', 'Perlas, Emerald', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Suljagic M', 'Longo PG', 'Bennardo S', 'Perlas E', 'Leone G', 'Laurenti L', 'Efremov DG']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Molecular Hematology Group, Campus A.

This system can repress gene expression by chromatin modification and is essential for establishing cell identity. PcG proteins are important for stem cell function and differentiation and have a profound impact during hematopoiesis. In recent years, several published studies have deepened our knowledge of the biology of the PcG in health and disease. In this article, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms of PcG-mediated repression and their relation to DNA methylation, and we discuss the role of the PcG system in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies. We suggest that alteration of different PcG members is a frequent event in leukemia and lymphomas that confers the stem cell properties on tumor cells.

IL-4 induced the rapid phosphorylation and activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 transcription factor in CLL cells in vitro. Longer incubation with IL-4 resulted in up-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L). All of these events were blocked by the JAK3-selective inhibitor, PF-956980. A dye reduction cytotoxicity assay showed that IL-4 induced resistance to the cytotoxic drugs fludarabine and chlorambucil and to the novel p53-elevating agent nutlin 3. IL-4-induced drug resistance was reversed by PF-956980. These conclusions were confirmed by independent assays for apoptosis induction (annexin V binding, cleavage of poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase, and morphologic analysis). Coculture with bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of supernatants derived from activated T-lymphocyte cultures also protected CLL cells from apoptosis induction by chlorambucil. Protection by these combined signals was reversed by PF-956980.

An attractive hypothesis is that local DNA features may participate in differential predisposition to gene hypermethylation. We found that, compared with methylation-resistant genes, methylation-prone genes have a lower frequency of SINE and LINE retrotransposons near their transcription start site. In several large testing sets, this distribution was highly predictive of promoter methylation. Genome-wide analysis showed that 22% of human genes were predicted to be methylation-prone in cancer; these tended to be genes that are down-regulated in cancer and that function in developmental processes. Moreover, retrotransposon distribution marks a larger fraction of methylation-prone genes compared to Polycomb group protein (PcG) marking in embryonic stem cells; indeed, PcG marking and our predictive model based on retrotransposon frequency appear to be correlated but also complementary. In summary, our data indicate that retrotransposon elements, which are widespread in our genome, are strongly associated with gene promoter DNA methylation in cancer and may in fact play a role in influencing epigenetic regulation in normal and abnormal physiological states.","['Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Gallegos, Juan', 'Vallot, Celine', 'Castoro, Ryan J', 'Chung, Woonbok', 'Maegawa, Shinji', 'Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Hartung, Helge', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Czerniak, Bogdan A', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Estecio MR', 'Gallegos J', 'Vallot C', 'Castoro RJ', 'Chung W', 'Maegawa S', 'Oki Y', 'Kondo Y', 'Jelinek J', 'Shen L', 'Hartung H', 'Aplan PD', 'Czerniak BA', 'Liang S', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. mestecio@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA085078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K25 CA123344/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100817,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,['0 (Retroelements)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']",PMC2945186,,2010/08/19 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.107318.110 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.107318.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2010 Oct;20(10):1369-82. doi: 10.1101/gr.107318.110.

The lack of immune priming in early childhood may result in abnormal immune responses to infections later in life and increase ALL risk. METHODS: The current analyses examined the association between childhood ALL and 208 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of 29 adaptive immune function genes among 377 ALL cases and 448 healthy controls. Single SNPs were analyzed with a log-additive approach using logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age, Hispanic ethnicity, and race. Sliding window haplotype analyses were done with haplotypes consisting of 2 to 6 SNPs. RESULTS: Of the 208 SNPs, only rs583911 of IL12A, which encodes a critical modulator of T-cell development, remained significant after accounting for multiple testing (odds ratio for each copy of the variant G allele, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.85; P = 2.9 x 10(-5)). This increased risk was stronger among firstborn children of all ethnicities and among non-Hispanic children with less day care attendance, consistent with the hypothesis about the role of early immune modulation in the development of childhood ALL. Haplotype analyses identified additional regions of CD28, FCGR2, GATA3, IL2RA, STAT4, and STAT6 associated with childhood ALL. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of genes on the adaptive immunity pathway are associated with childhood ALL risk. IMPACT: Results of this study support an immune-related etiology of childhood ALL. Further confirmation is required to detect functional variants in the significant genomic regions identified in this study, in particular for IL12A.","['Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Barcellos, Lisa F', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Aldrich, Melinda C', 'Guha, Neela', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Green, Janet', 'May, Suzanne L', 'Kiley, Vincent A', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Chang JS', 'Wiemels JL', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Metayer C', 'Barcellos LF', 'Hansen HM', 'Aldrich MC', 'Guha N', 'Urayama KY', 'Scelo G', 'Green J', 'May SL', 'Kiley VA', 'Wiencke JK', 'Buffler PA']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA. jeffreychang@nhri.org.tw']",['eng'],"['R01 ES009137-08/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-220023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-200023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-03/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-07/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-09/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-03S1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-05/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-02/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-190023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-04/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-22S10023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-01A1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-210023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-10S1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-230023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-22S30023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PS42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-05S1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-10/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-06A1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705-22S20023/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100817,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology']",PMC3257312,['NIHMS220398'],2010/08/19 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-10-0389 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0389 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Sep;19(9):2152-63. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0389.

Likewise, it is apparent that incorrect targeting of histone modifications contributes to misregulated gene expression and hence to developmental disorders and diseases of genomic instability such as cancer. The KMT2 family of SET domain methyltransferases, typified by mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1), is responsible for histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, a marker of active genes. To ensure that this modification is correctly targeted, a multiprotein complex associates with the methyltransferase and directs activity. We have identified a novel interaction site on the core complex protein WD repeat protein-5 (WDR5), and we mapped the complementary site on its partner retinoblastoma-binding protein-5 (RbBP5). We have characterized this interaction by x-ray crystallography and show how it is fundamental to the assembly of the complex and to the regulation of methyltransferase activity. We show which region of RbBP5 contributes directly to mixed lineage leukemia activation, and we combine our structural and biochemical data to produce a model to show how WDR5 and RbBP5 act cooperatively to stimulate activity.","['Odho, Zain', 'Southall, Stacey M', 'Wilson, Jon R']","['Odho Z', 'Southall SM', 'Wilson JR']","['From the Section of Structural Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.', 'From the Section of Structural Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.', 'From the Section of Structural Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.

To establish the etiologic role of XMRV infection in human disease requires large scale epidemiologic studies. Development of assays to detect XMRV-specific antibodies would greatly facilitate such studies. However, the nature and kinetics of the antibody response to XMRV infection have yet to be determined. RESULTS: Three rhesus macaques were infected with XMRV to determine the dynamics of the antibody responses elicited by infection with XMRV. All macaques developed antibodies to XMRV during the second week of infection, and the predominant responses were to the envelope protein gp70, transmembrane protein p15E, and capsid protein p30. In general, antibody responses to gp70 and p15E appeared early with higher titers than to p30, especially in the early period of seroconversion. Antibodies to gp70, p15E and p30 persisted to 158 days and were substantially boosted by re-infection, thus, were identified as useful serologic markers. Three high-throughput prototype assays were developed using recombinant proteins to detect antibodies to these viral proteins. Both gp70 and p15E prototype assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity by detecting all Western blot (WB) positive serial bleeds from the XMRV-infected macaques and good specificity (99.5-99.9%) with blood donors. Seroconversion sensitivity and specificity of the p30 prototype assay were 92% and 99.4% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first demonstration of seroconversion patterns elicited by XMRV infection. The nature and kinetics of antibody responses to XMRV in primates were fully characterized. Moreover, key serologic markers useful for detection of XMRV infection were identified. Three prototype immunoassays were developed to detect XMRV-specific antibodies. These assays demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity; thus, they will facilitate large scale epidemiologic studies of XMRV infection in humans.","['Qiu, Xiaoxing', 'Swanson, Priscilla', 'Luk, Ka-Cheung', 'Tu, Bailin', 'Villinger, Francois', 'Das Gupta, Jaydip', 'Silverman, Robert H', 'Klein, Eric A', 'Devare, Sushil', 'Schochetman, Gerald', 'Hackett, John Jr']","['Qiu X', 'Swanson P', 'Luk KC', 'Tu B', 'Villinger F', 'Das Gupta J', 'Silverman RH', 'Klein EA', 'Devare S', 'Schochetman G', 'Hackett J Jr']","['Infectious Diseases R&D, Abbott Diagnostics, 100 Abbott Park Rd, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA. xiaoxing.qiu@abbott.com']",['eng'],"['CA103943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DRR000165/PHS HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100817,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Gammaretrovirus/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/methods', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Structural Proteins/immunology', 'Virology/*methods']",PMC2931451,,2010/08/19 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/08/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-68 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-68 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Aug 17;7:68. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate a role for undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1) in regulating ES cell chromatin structure. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis, we identified >1,700 UTF1 target genes that significantly overlap with previously identified Nanog, Oct4, Klf-4, c-Myc, and Rex1 targets. Gene expression profiling showed that UTF1 knock down results in increased expression of a large set of genes, including a significant number of UTF1 targets. UTF1 knock down (KD) ES cells are, irrespective of the increased expression of several self-renewal genes, Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) dependent. However, UTF1 KD ES cells are perturbed in their differentiation in response to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or after LIF withdrawal and display increased colony formation. UTF1 KD ES cells display extensive chromatin decondensation, reflected by a dramatic increase in nucleosome release on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) treatment and enhanced MNase sensitivity of UTF1 target genes in UTF1 KD ES cells. Summarizing, our data show that UTF1 is a key chromatin component in ES cells, preventing ES cell chromatin decondensation, and aberrant gene expression; both essential for proper initiation of lineage-specific differentiation of ES cells.","['Kooistra, Susanne M', 'van den Boom, Vincent', 'Thummer, Rajkumar P', 'Johannes, Frank', 'Wardenaar, Rene', 'Tesson, Bruno M', 'Veenhoff, Liesbeth M', 'Fusetti, Fabrizia', ""O'Neill, Laura P"", 'Turner, Bryan M', 'de Haan, Gerald', 'Eggen, Bart J L']","['Kooistra SM', 'van den Boom V', 'Thummer RP', 'Johannes F', 'Wardenaar R', 'Tesson BM', 'Veenhoff LM', 'Fusetti F', ""O'Neill LP"", 'Turner BM', 'de Haan G', 'Eggen BJ']","['Department of Developmental Genetics, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen, Haren, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Utf1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2010/08/18 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.497 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2010 Oct;28(10):1703-14. doi: 10.1002/stem.497.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Birth order has been used as a proxy for prenatal and postnatal exposures, such as frequency of infections and in utero hormone exposures. We investigated the association between birth order and childhood cancers in a pooled case-control dataset. The subjects were drawn from population-based registries of cancers and births in California, Minnesota, New York, Texas and Washington. We included 17,672 cases <15 years of age who were diagnosed from 1980 to 2004 and 57,966 randomly selected controls born 1970-2004, excluding children with Down syndrome. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, adjusted for sex, birth year, maternal race, maternal age, multiple birth, gestational age and birth weight. Overall, we found an inverse relationship between childhood cancer risk and birth order. For children in the fourth or higher birth order category compared to first-born children, the adjusted OR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.93) for all cancers combined. When we examined risks by cancer type, a decreasing risk with increasing birth order was seen in the central nervous system tumors, neuroblastoma, bilateral retinoblastoma, Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. We observed increased risks with increasing birth order for acute myeloid leukemia but a slight decrease in risk for acute lymphoid leukemia. These risk estimates were based on a very large sample size, which allowed us to examine rare cancer types with greater statistical power than in most previous studies, however the biologic mechanisms remain to be elucidated.","['Von Behren, Julie', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Mueller, Beth A', 'Carozza, Susan E', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Fox, Erin E', 'Horel, Scott', 'Johnson, Kimberly J', 'McLaughlin, Colleen', 'Puumala, Susan E', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Reynolds, Peggy']","['Von Behren J', 'Spector LG', 'Mueller BA', 'Carozza SE', 'Chow EJ', 'Fox EE', 'Horel S', 'Johnson KJ', 'McLaughlin C', 'Puumala SE', 'Ross JA', 'Reynolds P']","['Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. julie.vonbehren@cpic.org']",['eng'],"['R01CA717450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP000783/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CN005230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092670-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58DP000783-01/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01CA92670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071745-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20101008,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Birth Order', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3008504,['NIHMS230557'],2010/08/18 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25593 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Jun 1;128(11):2709-16. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25593.

CLL cases associated with t(14;19) often have atypical morphologic and immunophenotypic features and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) variable region (V) genes, associated with an aggressive clinical course. We analyzed IGHV somatic mutation status and gene use in 11 patients with t(14;19)-positive CLL. All cases were unmutated, and the IGHV genes in 10 cases showed minimal deviation from germline sequences. In 7 of 11 patients, we found homologous heavy chain rearrangements using IGHV4-39; light chain analysis revealed identical IGKV1-39 use. Corresponding V-(D)-J sequences demonstrated remarkable stereotypy of the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain complementarity determining region 3 (H/K CDR3) genes. These findings raise the possibility that specific antigen drive is involved in the clonal development and/or selection of t(14;19)(q32;q13)-positive CLL cells.

Between January 2004 and December 2006, 27 patients with relapsed or refractory AML were enrolled in the present study. In total, 14 patients had experienced an early relapse, 10 had experienced a late relapse, and the remaining three (11%) had developed primary refractory leukemia at the time of study entry. Most patients (n = 17, 63%) had post-transplant relapse, and 10 of them relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). After FLANG treatment, 15 patients (56%) achieved a complete response (CR), and three patients died during reinduction chemotherapy. After achieving a CR, eight patients received SCT (seven allogeneic (sibling = 4, unrelated = 2, and haploidentical familial = 1) and one autologous SCT), one received donor lymphocyte infusion, three received consolidation chemotherapy, and the remaining three refused further therapy. Eight patients were alive during continuous CR, with an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 30% after a median follow-up of 42.1 months. The survival outcome of patients who received SCT was remarkable (EFS of 75%). Additionally, no toxicity severe enough to preclude transplantation was evident after or during FLANG. The findings of the present study suggest that FLANG salvage chemotherapy is an effective regimen and that it offers a safe bridge to SCT. Furthermore, this regimen prompts efforts to proceed to SCT as post-remission therapy for patients in greater than first CR.","['Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Choi, Su-Mi', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Kim, Chun-Choo']","['Eom KS', 'Min WS', 'Kim HJ', 'Cho BS', 'Choi SM', 'Lee DG', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Kim YJ', 'Cho SG', 'Lee JW', 'Kim CC']","[""Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, #505 Banpo-Dong, Seocho-Gu, Seoul 137-701, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100817,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLANG protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/18 06:00,2012/08/23 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9653-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28 Suppl 1:S462-70. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9653-6.

The effects of BA on the growth of K562 cells were studied by MTT assay. Apoptosis was assayed through Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double-labeled cytometry. The effects of BA on the cell cycle of K562 cells were studied by a PI method. The expression of Bax and capase-3 was detected by using Western blot. The results showed that BA was cytotoxic to K562 cells with an IC50 of 21.26 microg/mL at 24 h. After treating K562 cells with 10 microg/mL BA for 72 h, the number of cells was reduced by 58%. BA induced apoptosis of K562 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The proportion of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases was decreased and that in S phase was increased after K562 cells were treated with BA for 24 h. BA treatment also increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3. It suggested that BA could inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The antitumor effects of BA were related with up-regulation of the expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins. BA may qualify for the development of new therapies for leukemia.","['Wu, Qiuling', 'He, Jing', 'Fang, Jun', 'Hong, Mei']","['Wu Q', 'He J', 'Fang J', 'Hong M']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. wuqiuling@medmail.com.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100817,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The experiments were performed ex vivo using short-term cell cultures of blood and bone marrow cells from newly diagnosed untreated patients. We analyzed the expression of active caspase-3 and the BCL-2/BAX ratio as markers of apoptosis and the expression of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gammaH2AX) and activated ATM kinase, which are reporters of DNA damage. The results of our study revealed that resveratrol induced apoptosis in CLL cells in a tumor-specific manner but did not affect non-leukemic cells, and apoptosis was associated with a decreased BCL2/BAX ratio. Here, we report for the first time that both resveratrol + fludarabine and resveratrol + cladribine caused a higher rate of apoptosis in comparison to the rate caused by a single drug. The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by resveratrol alone was higher in the group of patients with better prognostic markers than in those with worse prognostic markers. However, the rates of apoptosis caused by resveratrol combined with purine analogues were independent of ZAP-70 and CD38 expression and the clinical state of the disease; they were only dependent on the presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. We also observed an increase in gammaH2AX expression together with a rise in activated ATM in most of the analyzed samples. The obtained results indicate that resveratrol might warrant further study as a new therapeutic option for CLL patients. This naturally occurring substance may be used as a single agent, especially in older persons for whom there are some limitations for the use of aggressive treatment. On the other hand, a lower purine analogue dose could potentially be used in combination with resveratrol because of their combined effect. One of the mechanisms of action of resveratrol is the induction of DNA damage, which ultimately leads to apoptosis.","['Podhorecka, Monika', 'Halicka, Dorota', 'Klimek, Piotr', 'Kowal, Malgorzata', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Dmoszynska, Anna']","['Podhorecka M', 'Halicka D', 'Klimek P', 'Kowal M', 'Chocholska S', 'Dmoszynska A']","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Staszica 11, 20-081, Lublin, Poland. monika.podhorecka@am.lublin.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100817,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', '*Cladribine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Purines/chemistry', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3018253,,2010/08/18 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1045-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Feb;90(2):173-83. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1045-7.

We explored this distinct incidence trend of CLL for Taiwanese. The epidemiologic data of CLL for Taiwanese and Caucasian Americans during 1986 to 2005 were obtained from the Taiwan National Cancer Registry and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, respectively. The individual effects of time period and birth cohort on the incidence trends were analyzed using an age-period-cohort model. Although there was a weak period effect corresponding to the increased applications of immunophenotyping in 1991 to 1995 in Taiwan, evidences suggested that the age-adjusted incidence rate of CLL for Taiwanese was continuously increasing during the 20-year period while that for Caucasian Americans remained steady. In addition, a much stronger birth-cohort effect was identified for Taiwanese but not for Caucasian Americans. This effect corresponded to the westernization of lifestyle in Taiwan since 1960. We conclude that, in addition to the ethnic difference of incidence, there is distinct increasing incidence trend of CLL in Taiwan. The strong birth-cohort effect underlying this increasing trend indicates that lifestyles and environmental factors may play a role in the development of CLL for Taiwanese.","['Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Lin, Yu-Jr', 'Chang, Chee-Jen', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Wu SJ', 'Huang SY', 'Lin CT', 'Lin YJ', 'Chang CJ', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100816,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Effect', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Whites']",,,2010/08/18 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30996-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-285221 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4430-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-285221.

It has been primarily described in transplant recipients but has recently been recognized in patients receiving chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma. It is associated with distinctive histologic features such as dilated anagen hair follicles, absent hair papillae, and abrupt cornification of the inner root sheath. OBSERVATIONS: A 5-year-old boy presented with spiny follicular papules that caused thickening of the skin of the face 1 year after cardiac transplantation. He had been exposed to several immunosuppressive agents, including mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, cylcophosphamide, and prednisone. Despite the failure of multiple topical treatments, our patient's eruption improved with systemic valganciclovir therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the youngest patient (to our knowledge) with viral-associated trichodysplasia of immunosuppression and discuss the characteristic clinicopathologic features. Our report supports the theory that immunosuppression is the predisposing factor to a folliculotropic papovavirus that alters follicular maturation.","['Benoit, Taylor', 'Bacelieri, Rocky', 'Morrell, Dean S', 'Metcalf, John']","['Benoit T', 'Bacelieri R', 'Morrell DS', 'Metcalf J']","['Department of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, 135 Rutledge Ave., Charleston, SC 29425, USA. benoitm@musc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'GCU97FKN3R (Valganciclovir)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Facial Dermatoses/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Ganciclovir/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Heart Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Valganciclovir']",,,2010/08/18 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['146/8/871 [pii]', '10.1001/archdermatol.2010.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2010 Aug;146(8):871-4. doi: 10.1001/archdermatol.2010.175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene reactivation after DAC is variable and incompletely understood. Here, we established a cell line system (YB5) derived from the SW48 colon cancer cell line to study DAC-induced reactivation. YB5 contains a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the locus is transcriptionally silent. GFP reexpression can be achieved by DAC treatment, but the expression level of individual cells is heterogeneous. DAC-treated YB5 cells were separated into GFP-positive and GFP-negative subpopulations. By comparing DAC-treated sorted GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we found that their methylation levels were similarly decreased but that histone modifications and histone H3 densities were remarkably different. Despite a similar degree of (incomplete) DNA hypomethylation, GFP-positive cells reverted to an active chromatin structure marked by higher H3K9 acetylation, lower H3K27 trimethylation, and lower promoter nucleosome density. GFP-negative cells had histone modifications and promoter nucleosome density, similar to parental cells. On DAC withdrawal, gradual resilencing and remethylation occurred in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, and the resilencing correlated with a gradual increase in nucleosome occupancy in GFP-positive cells. These data show that hypomethylation alone after DAC is insufficient for gene expression induction, and that chromatin resetting to an active state including nucleosome eviction is required for activation of protein expression. Our findings suggest that gene expression is the key in optimizing DAC treatment strategies in the clinic.","['Si, Jiali', 'Boumber, Yanis A', 'Shu, Jingmin', 'Qin, Taichun', 'Ahmed, Saira', 'He, Rong', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Si J', 'Boumber YA', 'Shu J', 'Qin T', 'Ahmed S', 'He R', 'Jelinek J', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-060001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-03S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121104-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-070001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA121104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-06S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121104-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121104-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098006-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100816,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects/physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",PMC2932851,['NIHMS223361'],2010/08/18 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-4474 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4474 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 1;70(17):6968-77. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4474.

While current efforts are focused on understanding heterotypic interactions between tumor cells and surrounding normal cells, much less is known about the interactions between and among heterogeneous tumor cells within a neoplasm. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) amplification and mutation (EGFRvIII/DeltaEGFR) are signature pathogenetic events that are invariably expressed in a heterogeneous manner. Strikingly, despite its greater biological activity than wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR), individual GBM tumors expressing both amplified receptors typically express wtEGFR in far greater abundance than the DeltaEGFR lesion. We hypothesized that the minor DeltaEGFR-expressing subpopulation enhances tumorigenicity of the entire tumor cell population, and thereby maintains heterogeneity of expression of the two receptor forms in different cells. Using mixtures of glioma cells as well as immortalized murine astrocytes, we demonstrate that a paracrine mechanism driven by DeltaEGFR is the primary means for recruiting wtEGFR-expressing cells into accelerated proliferation in vivo. We determined that human glioma tissues, glioma cell lines, glioma stem cells, and immortalized mouse Ink4a/Arf(-/-) astrocytes that express DeltaEGFR each also express IL-6 and/or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokines. These cytokines activate gp130, which in turn activates wtEGFR in neighboring cells, leading to enhanced rates of tumor growth. Ablating IL-6, LIF, or gp130 uncouples this cellular cross-talk, and potently attenuates tumor growth enhancement. These findings support the view that a minor tumor cell population can potently drive accelerated growth of the entire tumor mass, and thereby actively maintain tumor cell heterogeneity within a tumor mass. Such interactions between genetically dissimilar cancer cells could provide novel points of therapeutic intervention.","['Inda, Maria-del-Mar', 'Bonavia, Rudy', 'Mukasa, Akitake', 'Narita, Yoshitaka', 'Sah, Dinah W Y', 'Vandenberg, Scott', 'Brennan, Cameron', 'Johns, Terrance G', 'Bachoo, Robert', 'Hadwiger, Philipp', 'Tan, Pamela', 'Depinho, Ronald A', 'Cavenee, Webster', 'Furnari, Frank']","['Inda MM', 'Bonavia R', 'Mukasa A', 'Narita Y', 'Sah DW', 'Vandenberg S', 'Brennan C', 'Johns TG', 'Bachoo R', 'Hadwiger P', 'Tan P', 'Depinho RA', 'Cavenee W', 'Furnari F']","['University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA095616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA95616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Ligands)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Glioma/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC2922502,,2010/08/18 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['24/16/1731 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1890510 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Aug 15;24(16):1731-45. doi: 10.1101/gad.1890510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomic aberrations identify prognostic subgroups, pointing towards distinct underlying biological mechanisms that are poorly understood. In particular it remains unclear whether the prognostic subgroups of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by different levels of leukemogenic proteins. DESIGN AND METHODS: Expression of 23 proteins involved in apoptosis, proliferation, DNA damage, and signaling or whose genes map to chromosomal regions known to be critical in chronic lymphocytic leukemia was quantified in 185 cytogenetically well characterized cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia using immunoblotting. Cases were categorized hierarchically into deletion(17p), deletion(11q), trisomy 12, deletion(13q) as sole abnormality or normal karyotype. Statistical analysis was performed for expression differences between these subgroups. In addition, the expression levels of CDK4, P27 and P53 were quantified over the clinical course and compared to levels in immunopurified B cells from healthy individuals. RESULTS: In subgroups with a good prognosis, differential expression was mainly seen for proteins that regulate apoptosis. In contrast, in cytogenetic subgroups with a worse prognosis, differential expression was mostly detected for proteins that control DNA damage and proliferation. Expression levels of CDK4, P27 and P53 were higher compared to those in B cells from healthy individuals and significantly correlated with increasing hierarchical risk. In addition, no significant longitudinal changes of expression levels of CDK4, P27 and P53 could be detected in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.

The infusion of cytokine-induced killer cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia relapsing after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is well tolerated, but limited clinical responses have been observed. To improve their effector functions against acute myeloid leukemia, we genetically modified cytokine-induced killer cells with chimeric receptors specific for the CD33 myeloid antigen. DESIGN AND METHODS: SFG-retroviral vectors coding for anti-CD33-zeta and anti-CD33-CD28-OX40-zeta chimeric receptors were used to transduce cytokine-induced killer cells. Transduced cells were characterized in vitro for their ability to lyse leukemic targets (4-hour (51)chromium-release and 6-day co-cultures assays on human stromal mesenchymal cells), to proliferate ((3)H-thymidine-incorporation assay) and to secrete cytokines (flow cytomix assay) after contact with acute myeloid leukemia cells. Their activity against normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells was evaluated by analyzing the colony-forming unit capacity after co-incubation. RESULTS: Cytokine-induced killer cells were efficiently transduced with the anti-CD33 chimeric receptors, maintaining their native phenotype and functions and acquiring potent cytotoxicity (up to 80% lysis after 4-hour incubation) against different acute myeloid leukemia targets, as also confirmed in long-term killing experiments. Moreover, introduction of the anti-CD33 chimeric receptors was accompanied by prominent CD33-specific proliferative activity, with the release of high levels of immunostimulatory cytokines. The presence of CD28-OX40 in chimeric receptor endodomain was associated with a significant amelioration of the anti-leukemic activity of cytokine-induced killer cells. Importantly, even though the cytokine-induced killer cells transduced with anti-CD33 chimeric receptors showed toxicity against normal hematopoietic CD34(+) progenitor cells, residual clonogenic activity was preserved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that anti-CD33 chimeric receptors strongly enhance anti-leukemic cytokine-induced killer cell functions, suggesting that cytokine-induced killer cells transduced with these molecules might represent a promising optimized tool for acute myeloid leukemia immunotherapy.","['Marin, Virna', 'Pizzitola, Irene', 'Agostoni, Valentina', 'Attianese, Greta Maria Paola Giordano', 'Finney, Helene', 'Lawson, Alastair', 'Pule, Martin', 'Rousseau, Raphael', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Biagi, Ettore']","['Marin V', 'Pizzitola I', 'Agostoni V', 'Attianese GM', 'Finney H', 'Lawson A', 'Pule M', 'Rousseau R', 'Biondi A', 'Biagi E']","['Centro Ricerca M.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether crude methanolic extract of M macrocarpa (CMEMM) possessed antileukemic effects on HL-60, human leukemia cells. CMEMM was prepared from dried stems of this plant, and its apoptosis-inducing effects were investigated using HL-60 cells in vitro and in vivo. With treatment of 25 to 75 mug/mL CMEMM, the in vitro antiproliferative effect on HL-60 cells increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner during the 72-hour treatment period. The concentration of CMEMM that exhibited a 50% growth inhibition (IC(50)) for 72-hour exposure was 36.4 mug/mL. Apoptosis triggered by CMEMM in HL-60 cells was confirmed by the following observations: ( a) characteristic apoptotic nuclear fragmentation, (b) dose-dependent accumulation of sub-G(1) phase in cell cycle analyses, (c) increased percentages of annexin V-positive apoptotic cells, and (d) dose-dependent elevation of active caspase-3. Furthermore, an in vivo tumor growth suppression effect by CMEMM (500 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) was observed in mouse xenografts. The results suggest that CMEMM exerts antileukemic effects via an apoptotic pathway in HL-60 cells, and could be a candidate for developing antileukemic agents in the future.","['Lu, Kuan-Hung', 'Chang, Yuh-Fang', 'Yin, Pen-Hui', 'Chen, Ting-Ting', 'Ho, Yu-Ling', 'Chang, Yuan-Shiun', 'Chi, Chin-Wen']","['Lu KH', 'Chang YF', 'Yin PH', 'Chen TT', 'Ho YL', 'Chang YS', 'Chi CW']","['China Medical University, No. 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100816,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mucuna', 'Plant Preparations/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Stems']",,,2010/08/18 06:00,2011/03/09 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1534735410378661 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735410378661 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2010 Sep;9(3):298-308. doi: 10.1177/1534735410378661.

Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks the binding of CTLA-4 to its ligand. To test the hypothesis that blockade of CTLA-4 by ipilimumab could augment graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effects without a significant impact on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we conducted a phase I clinical trial of ipilimumab infusion in patients with relapsed malignancy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Here, we report the analysis of peripheral blood T lymphocyte reconstitution, T regulatory cell (Treg) expression, and T cell activation markers after a single dose of ipilimumab in 29 patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients before and after ipilimumab infusion. Lymphocyte immunophenotyes, including levels of CD4(+)CD25(high) cells and T cell activation markers, were analyzed in all cases. Levels of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) cells and intracellular CTLA-4 in CD4(+) T cells also were evaluated in the last 11 cases. We found lower baseline levels of CD4(+) and CD45RO(+) T cells in patients compared with normal controls. More than 50% of the patients had abnormally low lymphocyte counts (CD4 or/and CD8 T cells), and some had no circulating B lymphocytes. The percentages of both CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) T cells were significantly higher in patients before ipilimumab infusion than in healthy donors. Twenty of 29 patients exhibited an elevated level of CD4(+)CD25(low) activated T cells at baseline, compared with only 3 of 26 healthy donors. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts were significantly increased after ipilimumab infusion. There was no consistent change in absolute lymphocyte count or in the number of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69. However, increases in CD4(+)CD25(low) T cells were seen in 20 of 29 patients and increases in CD4(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells were seen in the last 10 patients in the first 60 days after ipilimumab infusion. Although the percentages of both CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) T cells decreased significantly during the observation period, the absolute cell counts did not change. Intracellular CTLA-4 expression in CD4(+)CD25(lo/-) T cells increased significantly after ipilimumab infusion. We conclude that CTLA-4 blockade by a single infusion of ipilimumab increased CD4(+) and CD4(+)HLA-DR(+) T lymphocyte counts and intracellular CTLA-4 expression at the highest dose level. There was no significant change in Treg cell numbers after ipilimumab infusion. These data demonstrate that significant changes in T cell populations occur on exposure to a single dose of ipilimumab. Further studies with multiple doses are needed to explore this phenomenon further and to correlate changes in lymphocyte subpopulations with clinical events.","['Zhou, Jiehua', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Zhong, Ruikun', 'Corringham, Sue', 'Messer, Karen', 'Pu, Minya', 'Ma, Wenxue', 'Chut, Theresa', 'Soiffer, Robert', 'Mitrovich, Rachel C', 'Lowy, Israel', 'Ball, Edward D']","['Zhou J', 'Bashey A', 'Zhong R', 'Corringham S', 'Messer K', 'Pu M', 'Ma W', 'Chut T', 'Soiffer R', 'Mitrovich RC', 'Lowy I', 'Ball ED']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA093891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093891-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20100814,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', '*Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*immunology/physiopathology/prevention & control/therapy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Ipilimumab', 'Lectins, C-Type/analysis', 'Leukemia/*immunology/physiopathology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology/physiopathology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC2992836,['NIHMS229788'],2010/08/18 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00344-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 May;17(5):682-92. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.08.005.

METHODS: The plasma for analysis by both methods was deproteinated by methanol containing d8-imatinib. The separation was achieved on a 1.7 mum C18 column with a linear gradient (4 mM ammonium formiate and acetonitrile, pH 3.2). FIA was performed at flow rate of 0.03 mL/min (0.1% formic acid in methanol). Multiple reaction monitoring mode on the tandem mass spectrometer (API 4000, AB Sciex) in positive ESI were used for detection. RESULTS: The total analysis times were 3.2 (LC) and 0.75 min (FIA). Both methods were successfully validated and applied to the plasma patients samples. The limits of quantification were 4.1 and 30.8 ng/mL; imprecisions were less than 5.7% and recovery ranged between 93 and 105%, for the LC and FIA, respectively. The methods revealed an agreement with a mean difference of 1.46 ng/mL (SD 28.95 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The high-throughput methods that were developed are suitable for the therapeutic drug monitoring of imatinib in plasma. They can be used in routine clinical practice.","['Micova, Katerina', 'Friedecky, David', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Polynkova, Adriana', 'Adam, Tomas']","['Micova K', 'Friedecky D', 'Faber E', 'Polynkova A', 'Adam T']","['Laboratory of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, University Hospital and Palacky University in Olomouc, I.P.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based study of all Australian children (aged 0-14 years), adolescents (15-19 years) and young adults (20-29 years) diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) between 1982 and 2004, with follow-up to 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 5-year survival from ALL, AML, HL and NHL analysed for four periods of diagnosis (1982-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999 and 2000-2004). RESULTS: During 1982-2004, 13 015 people aged < or = 29 years were diagnosed with primary leukaemia or lymphoma in Australia. For those with ALL, 5-year survival for adolescents improved from 40% (1982-1989) to 74% (2000-2004); the improvement for young adults was smaller (31% to 47%), and both these groups still had lower survival than children, whose 5-year survival improved from 74% to 88%. There was a larger narrowing of the gap for AML: for cases diagnosed in 2000-2004, 5-year survival was similar for young adults (63%), adolescents (74%) and children (69%). For lymphoma cases diagnosed in 2000-2004, 5-year survival in all age groups was greater than 95% for HL and greater than 81% for NHL, although children fared better than adolescents and young adults. CONCLUSIONS: These Australian population-based data confirm an improvement in survival from haematological malignancies across all three age groups, but an age-related survival gap remains for adolescents and young adults compared with children, especially for young adults with ALL. Greater participation of adolescents and young adults in clinical trials and more detailed data collection are needed to provide evidence about optimal treatment regimens in these age groups.","['Pinkerton, Ross', 'Wills, Rachael-Anne', 'Coory, Michael D', 'Fraser, Christopher J']","['Pinkerton R', 'Wills RA', 'Coory MD', 'Fraser CJ']","[""Queensland Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 21 children aged from 1 to 15 with ALL (17 with pre-B ALL and 4 with T-ALL) we made the analysis: at diagnosis (point I), after induction remission (point II) and after the end of intensive treatment (point III). Control group was composed of 47 healthy persons. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the mean plasma values of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-2 were lower than in control group, whereas TIMP-1 levels were similar. During and after the treatment we found the increase of MMP-2 comparing to the values at diagnosis (relatively p = 0.003 and p = 0.008). Plasma MMP-9 was higher at point III of analysis than at point II. The levels of TIMP-2 increased in following points of the study We did not found the influence of immunophenotype, initial LDH levels and leukocytosis on MMPs and TIMPs values. At diagnosis, the ratio MMP-2/TIMP-1 was at the same level as in the control but it was higher during and after the intensive treatment. At diagnosis as well as during the treatment the ratios MMP-9/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 were lower than in control. At diagnosis we found a positive correlation between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 (r = 0.679, p = 0.001) and between TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (r = 0.482, p = 0.027), whereas during the treatment--only a positive correlation between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was observed (r = 0.766, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in plasma matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors between leukemic patients and control group, as well as in patients during the treatment, suggest their probable role in the development of leukemic process. The analysis conducted in the bigger group of patients, establishing simultaneously levels of these markers in plasma and in leukemic cells, would be advisable.","['Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Kuzmicz, Marta', 'Mroczko, Barbara', 'Szmitkowski, Maciej']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Kuzmicz M', 'Mroczko B', 'Szmitkowski M']","['Uniwersytet Medyczny w Bialymstoku, Klinika Onkologii i Hematologii Dzieciecej. rybak@umwb.edu.pl']",['pol'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*blood', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Reference Values', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/*blood', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/*blood']",,,2010/08/18 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/08/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2010 Jul;29(169):14-8.,,,,,,,,,Metaloproteinazy macierzy zewnatrzkomorkowej MMP-2 i MMP-9 oraz tkankowe inhibitory TIMP-1 i TIMP-2 w osoczu dzieci chorych na ostra bialaczke limfoblastyczna.,,,,,,,

In addition, emerging evidence concerning the combination of bendamustine, rituximab, and bortezomib was presented. Other trials discussed the use of novel monoclonal antibodies such as of atumumab, GA101, PRO131921, and inotuzumab ozogamicin, which are directed at new biological targets for the treatment of NHL.

They emerge in the vertebrate conceptus around midgestation. Genetic studies have identified a number of transcription factors and signaling molecules that act at the onset of hematopoiesis, and have begun to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of HSCs. One molecule that has been a particularly useful marker of this developmental event in multiple species is Runx1 (also known as AML1, Pebp2alpha). Runx1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, that along with its homologues Runx2 and Runx3 and their shared non-DNA binding subunit CBFbeta, constitute a small family of transcription factors called core-binding factors (CBFs). Runx1 is famous for its role in HSC emergence, and notorious for its involvement in leukemia, as chromosomal rearrangements and inactivating mutations in the human RUNX1 gene are some of the most common events in de novo and therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Here we will review the role of Runx1 in HSC emergence in the mouse conceptus and describe some of the genetic pathways that operate upstream and downstream of this gene.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the megakaryoblastic leukemia (MKL) family members, which function not only as actin-binding proteins but also as serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional coactivators, regulate neuronal morphology. However, the extracellular ligands and signaling pathways, which activate MKL-mediated morphological changes in neurons, remain unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to MKL1, MKL2, highly enriched in the forebrain, strongly contributes to the dendritic complexity, and this process is triggered by stimulation with activin, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Activin promoted dendritic complexity in a SRF- and MKL-dependent manner without drastically affecting MKL localization and protein levels. In contrast, activin promoted the nuclear export of suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI), which is a corepressor for SRF and MKL. Furthermore, overexpression of SCAI blocked activin-induced SRF transcriptional responses and dendritic complexity. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that activin-SCAI-MKL signaling is a novel pathway that regulates the dendritic morphology of rat cortical neurons by excluding SCAI from the nucleus and activating MKL/SRF-mediated gene expression.","['Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Nishijima, Naoki', 'Shiota, Jun', 'Sakagami, Hiroyuki', 'Tsuchida, Kunihiro', 'Mizukoshi, Miho', 'Fukuchi, Mamoru', 'Tsuda, Masaaki', 'Tabuchi, Akiko']","['Ishikawa M', 'Nishijima N', 'Shiota J', 'Sakagami H', 'Tsuchida K', 'Mizukoshi M', 'Fukuchi M', 'Tsuda M', 'Tabuchi A']","['From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 228-8555, Japan.', 'Division for Therapies Against Intractable Diseases, Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Aichi 470-1192, Japan.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.

The aim of our study was to find out the accurate epidemiologic situation of CLL and the diagnostic and therapeutic preferences of hematologists in the preselect area: the South Moravian Region (1,127,718 inhabitants, white race). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The total number of 540 patients (median age at the time of diagnosis, 65 years; sex, 306 men and 234 women) who had been followed in 2008 were included in the analysis. RESULTS: In the years 2006 and 2007, the incidence of CLL was 5.8 and 6.2, respectively, per 100,000; the prevalence was 48 per 100,000. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment was indicated in 194 patients (36%); 93 (17%) of them also underwent the second line of treatment. Of these 194 patients, 64 patients (33%) were given fludarabine-based regimens, and 74 patients (38%) received chlorambucil as a first line of treatment. Thirty patients were treated within clinical trials. Although the treatment was indicated in only one third of patients (36%), new prognostic factors were examined in > 50% of patients. CONCLUSION: The ascertained incidence of CLL in our region is higher than declared incidence in the past.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, open-label, noncomparative phase II study of obatoclax mesylate, a small-molecule pan-BCL-2 antagonist, in patients with MF. Obatoclax was administered as a 24-hour infusion (on an outpatient basis) every 2 weeks at a fixed dose of 60 mg. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 63 years (range, 43-89 years). Twelve were men, and all 22 patients were previously treated (median of 2 previous therapies). Ten patients (45%) had a Lille score of 1, and 9 patients (41%) had a Lille score of 2. Thirteen (59%) were red blood cell transfusion dependent. A median of 7 cycles of obatoclax were administered. No patient achieved complete or partial response according to International Working Group criteria. One patient (4%) demonstrated a clinical improvement (in terms of hemoglobin and platelet count) after 7 cycles of therapy. The improvement was sustained for 4 cycles of therapy, after which he underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The most common adverse events included low-grade ataxia and fatigue in 50% of the patients. Dose reduction because of toxicity was required in 1 patient, whereas 2 patients were taken off the study because of grade 3 ataxia and grade 3 heart failure. Grade 3/4 anemia and thrombocytopenia were evident in 6 (27%) and 4 (18%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Obatoclax exhibits no significant clinical activity in patients with MF at the dose and schedule evaluated.","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Walsh, William', 'Asatiani, Ekatherine', 'El-Shami, Khaled', 'Winton, Elliott', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Parikh SA', 'Kantarjian H', 'Schimmer A', 'Walsh W', 'Asatiani E', 'El-Shami K', 'Winton E', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Sunitinib is a multitargeted small-molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with myelofibrosis were treated with sunitinib at a daily continuous dose of 37.5 mg orally. The median duration of sunitinib treatment was 5.2 months (range, 1-18 months). RESULTS: One patient (7%) showed a clinical improvement of anemia (increase in hemoglobin of 4 g/dL), with improvement in anemia-associated symptoms. The time to response was 6 months, and the benefit was sustained for 12 months. However, 8 patients (57%) experienced a total of 13 incidents of significant (grade 3-4) adverse events possibly related to sunitinib (fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia were the most common). In 7 patients (50%), sunitinib was held, and subsequently the dose was reduced to 25 mg daily. Overall, 29% of patients withdrew from the study because of toxicity. CONCLUSION: Sunitinib therapy, as applied here, was not well-tolerated by patients with myelofibrosis, and the benefits were minimal. Our experience with sunitinib combined with previous experience with other antiangiogenic medications suggest that this class of drugs may have limited usefulness in myelofibrosis when used as a single-agent therapy.","['Apostolidou, Effrosyni', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Burger, Ian', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Apostolidou E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Thomas D', 'Burger I', 'Borthakur G', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

They found significant associations between dozens of gene-expression levels and radiation resistance of OSCC cell lines. Following analysis of the different radiosensitive cancer cell lines, the friend leukaemia insertion (Fli)-1 gene was selected as a prediction marker gene for OSCC radiotherapy resistance. Fli-1 expression was associated with radiation resistance in OSCC patients. These data help to predict the effects radiation therapy has on OSCC, in turn contributing to the development of alternative radiation therapies.","['Shintani, S', 'Hamakawa, H', 'Nakashiro, K', 'Shirota, T', 'Hatori, M', 'Tanaka, M', 'Kuroshita, Y', 'Kurokawa, Y']","['Shintani S', 'Hamakawa H', 'Nakashiro K', 'Shirota T', 'Hatori M', 'Tanaka M', 'Kuroshita Y', 'Kurokawa Y']","['Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Showa University School of Dentistry, Ota-ku, Tokyo, Japan. shintani@dent.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100814,Denmark,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,8605826,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Mouth Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0901-5027(10)00304-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijom.2010.02.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2010 Nov;39(11):1115-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijom.2010.02.027.

Nusslein-Volhard and E. F. Wieschaus, hedgehog (hh) signaling has come a long way. Today it is regarded as a key regulator in embryogenesis where it governs processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning. Furthermore, in adults it is involved in the maintenance of stem cells, and in tissue repair and regeneration. But hh signaling has a second-much darker-face: it plays an important role in several types of human cancers where it promotes growth and enables proliferation of tumor stem cells. The etiology of medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma is tightly linked to aberrant hh activity, but also cancers of the prostate, the pancreas, the colon, the breasts, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia, are dependent on irregular hh activity. Recent clinical studies have shown that hh signaling can be the basis of an important new class of therapeutic agents with far-reaching implications in oncology. Thus, modulation of hh signaling by means of small molecules has emerged as a valuable tool in combating these hh-dependent cancers. Cyclopamine, a unique natural product with a fascinating history, was the first identified inhibitor of hh signaling and its story is closely linked to the progress in the whole field. In this review we will trace the story of cyclopamine, give an overview on the biological modes of hh signaling both in untransformed and malignant cells, and finally present potent modulators of the hh pathway-many of them already in clinical studies. For more than 30 years now the knowledge on hh signaling has grown steadily-an end to this development is far from being conceivable.","['Heretsch, Philipp', 'Tzagkaroulaki, Lito', 'Giannis, Athanassios']","['Heretsch P', 'Tzagkaroulaki L', 'Giannis A']","['Institut for Organische Chemie, Universitat Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100723,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Veratrum Alkaloids)', 'ZH658AJ192 (cyclopamine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Hedgehog Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Veratrum Alkaloids/chemistry/pharmacology']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(10)00691-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2010.07.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2010 Sep 15;18(18):6613-24. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2010.07.038.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and infection in febrile children. METHODS: A prospective convenience sample of children presenting with fever to an urban pediatric ED were studied. Blood and urine cultures, a complete blood count, and serum concentrations of sPLA2 were obtained, and patients were compared based on their final diagnosis of either a viral or bacterial infection. RESULTS: In the 76 patients enrolled, 60 were diagnosed with a viral infection, 14 with a bacterial infection, 1 with Kawasaki disease, and 1 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The difference in the serum concentration of sPLA2 in patients with viral infections (22 +/- 34 ng/mL) versus those with bacterial infections (190 +/- 179 ng/mL) was statistically significant (P < .0001). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that sPLA2 was more accurate at predicting bacterial infection (area under the curve = 0.89) than the total white blood cell count (area under the curve = 0.71) and that a value of more than 20 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 67%, positive predictive value of 39%, and negative predictive value of 97%. CONCLUSION: Secretory phospholipase A2 differs significantly in children with viral versus bacterial infection and seems to be a reliable screening test for bacterial infection in febrile children.","['Mansour, Karim M', 'Kuypers, Frans A', 'Wang, Tammy N', 'Miller, Annabeth M', 'Larkin, Sandra K', 'Morris, Claudia R']","['Mansour KM', 'Kuypers FA', 'Wang TN', 'Miller AM', 'Larkin SK', 'Morris CR']","[""Children's Hospital and Research Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, Oakland, CA 94618, USA. kmansour@mail.cho.org""]",['eng'],"['K23 HL004386/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5 U54 HL-070583/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-04386-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL066355/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR01271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR001271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-66355/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL070583/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100813,United States,Am J Emerg Med,The American journal of emergency medicine,8309942,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2, Secretory)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/blood/diagnosis', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Fever/*blood/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*blood/diagnosis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome/blood/diagnosis', 'Phospholipases A2, Secretory/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Virus Diseases/blood/diagnosis']",PMC3601899,['NIHMS440144'],2010/08/17 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0735-6757(10)00294-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajem.2010.06.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Emerg Med. 2011 Nov;29(9):1163-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ajem.2010.06.024.

Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved in 34/40 older patients (85%) as compared to 69/77 younger patients (89.6%), without statistically significant differences. Severe (grades 3-4 WHO) hematological and extra-hematological toxicities were more common in older patients (p=0.02 and p=0.017, respectively). Rates of permanent Imatinib discontinuation and dose reduction to 300 mg or less were significantly higher in older patients (p=0.009 and p=0.001, respectively).

To overcome this problem, future trials concerning best dosage in this subset of patients could be useful.","['Latagliata, Roberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Cannella, Laura', 'De Cuia, Rosa', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Frustaci, Anna', 'Loglisci, Giuseppina', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Santopietro, Michelina', 'Stefanizzi, Caterina', 'Volpicelli, Paola', 'Vozella, Federico', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Latagliata R', 'Breccia M', 'Carmosino I', 'Cannella L', 'De Cuia R', 'Diverio D', 'Frustaci A', 'Loglisci G', 'Mancini M', 'Santopietro M', 'Stefanizzi C', 'Volpicelli P', 'Vozella F', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. rob.lati@libero.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100813,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Comorbidity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00325-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Nov;34(11):1472-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.07.001.

Susceptibility to autoxidation and production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), mostly H(2)O(2), have been suggested to occur in vitro but also in vivo. In this study, we address whether autoxidation-derived H(2)O(2) may be involved in the cytoprotective effects of EGCG. To that end we investigated keratinocyte-derived HaCat and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with significantly different sensitivities to H(2)O(2) (IC(50) 117.3 versus 58.3 muM, respectively) and EGCG (134.1 versus 84.1 muM). HaCat cells significantly resisted cytotoxicity and DNA damage based on enhanced H(2)O(2) clearance, improved DNA repair, and reduced intracellular ROS generation. Cumulative versus bolus EGCG and H(2)O(2) treatment and H(2)O(2) pretreatment before subsequent high-dose EGCG and vice versa significantly reduced DNA damage and cytotoxicity in HaCat cells only. Addition of catalase abolished the protective activities of low-dose H(2)O(2) and EGCG. In summary, our data suggest that autoxidative generation of low-dose H(2)O(2) is a significant player in the cell-type-specific cytoprotection mediated by EGCG and support the hypothesis that regular green tea consumption can contribute as a pro-oxidant to increased resistance against high-dose oxidative stressors.","['Elbling, Leonilla', 'Herbacek, Irene', 'Weiss, Rosa-Maria', 'Jantschitsch, Christian', 'Micksche, Michael', 'Gerner, Christopher', 'Pangratz, Heinrich', 'Grusch, Michael', 'Knasmuller, Siegfried', 'Berger, Walter']","['Elbling L', 'Herbacek I', 'Weiss RM', 'Jantschitsch C', 'Micksche M', 'Gerner C', 'Pangratz H', 'Grusch M', 'Knasmuller S', 'Berger W']","['Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. leonilla.elbling@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100812,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytoprotection', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', '*Oxidative Stress']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2011/05/18 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(10)00476-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2010 Nov 15;49(9):1444-52. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.08.008.

The most prominent example of such therapy is imatinib (Gleevec), which targets the BCR-ABL kinase and provides an effective low-toxicity treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia. This success has spawned myriad efforts to develop similarly targeted drugs for other cancers. Unfortunately, the high expectations of these efforts have not yet been realized, likely due to the genetic diversity among and within tumors, as well as the complex and largely unpredictable interactions of drug-like compounds with innumerable targets that affect cellular and organismal metabolism. While improvements in sequencing technologies are beginning to address the first problem, solving the second problem requires methods for linking specific features of the cancer genome to their optimally targeted therapies. One approach, referred to as chemical genetics, accomplishes this by genetic control of chemical susceptibility. Chemical genetics is a crucial tool for the rational development of cancer drugs.","['Burkard, Mark E', 'Jallepalli, Prasad V']","['Burkard ME', 'Jallepalli PV']","['University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53792, USA. mburkard@wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014520-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM094972/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-38/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-36/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM094972-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-37/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011-02/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-34/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM094972-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011-04/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100812,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Drug Discovery', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3028588,['NIHMS260952'],2010/08/17 06:00,2011/02/09 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-419X(10)00059-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbcan.2010.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Dec;1806(2):251-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbcan.2010.08.002.

We present a prospective, case-surveillance study of such patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed H1N1-influenza who presented to our institution between September 2009 and January 2010. Ninety-two patients presented with influenza-like symptoms, and 13 had H1N1 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, including 4 allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (1 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 1 with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia [CLL], 1 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1 with chronic myelogenous leukemia), 5 patients with multiple myeloma following autologous stem cell transplantation, 1 patient with multiple myeloma perimobilization, 2 patients with NHL post chemotherapy, and 1 patient with CLL. All 13 patients required hospitalization. Six (43%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom 4 (67%) died. We evaluated B cell and T cell responses to H1N1 infection prospectively in these patients compared with those in 4 otherwise healthy controls. Within 12 weeks of diagnosis, only 6 of 11 patients developed seropositive antibody titers as measured by hemagglutination-inhibition or microneutralization assays, compared with 4 of 4 controls. H1N1-specific T cells were detected in only 2 of 8 evaluable patients compared with 4 of 4 controls. H1N1-specific T cells were functional, capable of producing interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and CD107a mobilization. Furthermore, CD154 was up-regulated on CD4(+) T cells in 3 of 4 controls and 2 of 2 patients who had both B cell and T cell responses to H1N1. Post-H1N1 infection, 5 of 8 patients developed seasonal influenza-specific T cells, suggesting cross-reactivity induced by H1N1 infection.

It was found that several miRNAs are directly involved in human cancers, including lung, breast, brain, liver, colon cancer and leukemia. In addition, some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in tumor development. Furthermore, a widespread down-regulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. More than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites, frequently amplified or deleted in human cancer, suggesting an important role in malignant transformation. A better understanding of the miRNA regulation and misexpression in cancer may ultimately yield further insight into the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and new therapeutic strategies may arise against cancer. Here, we discuss the occurrence of the deregulated expression of miRNAs in human cancers and their importance in the tumorigenic process.","['Melo, Sonia A', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Melo SA', 'Esteller M']","['Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100811,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-5793(10)00646-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2010.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2011 Jul 7;585(13):2087-99. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2010.08.009.

During this process, several apoptosis-regulatory genes are induced in apoptotic cells. Among these genes, cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3) and B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) are the most effective apoptotic regulators because they play a decisive role in the occurrence of apoptosis. Research has shown that propofol, which is an intravenous anesthetic agent, exhibits neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, although the neuroprotective mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of propofol in rats after forebrain ischemia-reperfusion. We assessed the expression of hippocampal caspase-3, which acts as an apoptotic activator, and Bcl-2, which acts as an apoptotic suppressor. Forebrain ischemia was induced in hypotensive rats by clamping the bilateral common carotid arteries for 10 min. Propofol was administered via a lateral cerebral ventricle injection using a microsyringe after the induction of ischemia. Neuronal damage was determined by histological examination of brain sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus. Caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expression in the hippocampus were detected using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. We also used an immunohistochemical method after ischemia-reperfusion. In the hippocampus, caspase-3 and Bcl-2 mRNA were dramatically increased at 24h after forebrain ischemia. Following 6-24h of reperfusion, forebrain ischemia for 10 min induced a gradual increase in the expression of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 protein in the rat hippocampus, which peaked at 24h. In the propofol (1.0mg/kg) intervention group, the hippocampal expression of caspase-3 mRNA decreased significantly in rats 24h after ischemia; Bcl-2 mRNA was increased at the same time point. During the 24-h reperfusion period and after treatment with propofol, the level of caspase-3 protein expression was low, while the level of Bcl-2 was high. Thus, our results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of propofol against neuronal apoptosis may be mediated by the inhibition of caspase-3 expression and an increase in Bcl-2 expression.","['Li, Jun', 'Han, Baoqing', 'Ma, Xuesong', 'Qi, Sihua']","['Li J', 'Han B', 'Ma X', 'Qi S']","['Department of Anesthesiology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 150001 Harbin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100811,Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Anesthetics, Intravenous/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Caspase 3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hippocampus/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Propofol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reperfusion Injury/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2011/06/18 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(10)01759-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2010.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2010 Oct 14;1356:11-23. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.08.012.

Paradoxically, arsenic trioxide can also be used to induce remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with a success rate of approximately 80%. A comprehensive study examining the mechanisms and potential signaling pathways contributing to the anti-tumor properties of arsenic trioxide has not been carried out. METHODS: Here we applied a systems biology approach to identify gene biomarkers that underlie tumor cell responses to arsenic-induced cytotoxicity. The baseline gene expression levels of 14,500 well characterized human genes were associated with the GI50 data of the NCI-60 tumor cell line panel from the developmental therapeutics program (DTP) database. Selected biomarkers were tested in vitro for the ability to influence tumor susceptibility to arsenic trioxide. RESULTS: A significant association was found between the baseline expression levels of 209 human genes and the sensitivity of the tumor cell line panel upon exposure to arsenic trioxide. These genes were overlayed onto protein-protein network maps to identify transcriptional networks that modulate tumor cell responses to arsenic trioxide. The analysis revealed a significant enrichment for the oxidative stress response pathway mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) with high expression in arsenic resistant tumor cell lines. The role of the NRF2 pathway in protecting cells against arsenic-induced cell killing was validated in tumor cells using shRNA-mediated knock-down. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show that the expression level of genes in the NRF2 pathway serve as potential gene biomarkers of tumor cell responses to arsenic trioxide. Importantly, we demonstrate that tumor cells that are deficient for NRF2 display increased sensitivity to arsenic trioxide. The results of our study will be useful in understanding the mechanism of arsenic-induced cytotoxicity in cells, as well as the increased applicability of arsenic trioxide as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment.","['Liu, Qian', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Smeester, Lisa', 'Zou, Fei', 'Kesic, Matt', 'Jaspers, Ilona', 'Pi, Jingbo', 'Fry, Rebecca C']","['Liu Q', 'Zhang H', 'Smeester L', 'Zou F', 'Kesic M', 'Jaspers I', 'Pi J', 'Fry RC']","['Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES016005/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES005948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100813,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'RNA Interference', 'United States']",PMC2939609,,2010/08/17 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-3-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-3-37 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2010 Aug 13;3:37. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-3-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, performing such a measurement remains a challenge. For example, the presence of air bubbles in a suspension of cells during the measurements may lead to the incorrect interpretation of the acoustic signals. This work introduces a technique for measuring the ultrasound backscatter from individual micron-sized objects by combining a microinjection system with a co-registered optical microscope and an ultrasound imaging device. This allowed the measurement of the ultrasound backscatter response from a single object under optical microscope guidance. The optical and ultrasonic data were used to determine the size of the object and to deduce its backscatter responses, respectively. In order to calibrate the system, the backscatter frequency responses from polystyrene microspheres were measured and compared to theoretical predictions. A very good agreement was found between the measured backscatter responses of individual microspheres and theoretical predictions of an elastic sphere. The backscatter responses from single OCI-AML-5 cells were also investigated. It was found that the backscatter responses from AML cells are best modeled using the fluid sphere model. The advantages, limitations, and future applications of the developed technique are discussed.","['Falou, Omar', 'Rui, Min', 'El Kaffas, Ahmed', 'Kumaradas, J Carl', 'Kolios, Michael C']","['Falou O', 'Rui M', 'El Kaffas A', 'Kumaradas JC', 'Kolios MC']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, Ontario M5B 2K3, Canada. ofalou@ryerson.ca']",['eng'],"['79447/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-97959/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Acoust Soc Am,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,7503051,['0 (Polystyrenes)'],IM,"['Calibration', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Size', 'Elasticity', 'Equipment Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging', 'Microinjections', 'Microscopy', 'Microspheres', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Particle Size', 'Polystyrenes', '*Scattering, Radiation', '*Ultrasonography/instrumentation/standards']",,,2010/08/17 06:00,2011/01/29 06:00,['2010/08/17 06:00'],"['2010/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1121/1.3455795 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acoust Soc Am. 2010 Aug;128(2):894-902. doi: 10.1121/1.3455795.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paradigm study we have employed a range of proteomic approaches to analyse the effects of one such PTK, BCR/ABL. We have employed phosphoproteome enrichment techniques allied to peptide and protein quantification to identify proteins and pathways involved in cellular transformation. Amongst the proteins shown to be regulated at the post-translational level were cofilin, an actin-severing protein thus linked to altered motility and Cbl an E3 ubiquitin ligase integrally linked to the control of tyrosine kinase signalling (regulated by 5 and 6 PTKs respectively). The major class of proteins identified however were molecular chaperones. We also showed that HSP90 phosphorylation is altered by BCR/ABL action and that HSP90 plays a crucial role in oncogene stability. Further investigation with another six leukaemogenic PTKs demonstrates that this HSP90 role in oncogene stability appears to be a common phenomenon in a range of leukaemias.

Seminal plasma samples from HIV-1 infected men were examined as they have an increased probability of acquiring sexually transmitted pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied the prevalence of XMRV in 93 seminal plasma samples of 54 HIV-1 infected men living in The Netherlands with a nested PCR amplification specifically targeting the XMRV gag gene. As a control for the presence and integrity of retrovirus particles, HIV-1 was amplified from the same samples with a PCR amplification targeting the env gene of the virus, or HIV-1 was quantified with a real-time PCR amplifying part of the pol gene. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although HIV-1 was amplified from 25% of the seminal plasma samples, no XMRV was detected, suggesting that either the prevalence of XMRV is very low in The Netherlands, or that XMRV is not naturally present in the seminal plasma.","['Cornelissen, Marion', 'Zorgdrager, Fokla', 'Blom, Petra', 'Jurriaans, Suzanne', 'Repping, Sjoerd', 'van Leeuwen, Elisabeth', 'Bakker, Margreet', 'Berkhout, Ben', 'van der Kuyl, Antoinette C']","['Cornelissen M', 'Zorgdrager F', 'Blom P', 'Jurriaans S', 'Repping S', 'van Leeuwen E', 'Bakker M', 'Berkhout B', 'van der Kuyl AC']","['Laboratory of Experimental Virology, Department of Medical Microbiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100810,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', '*Gammaretrovirus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'HIV Infections/transmission/*virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Heterosexuality', 'Homosexuality, Male', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Probability', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Semen/*virology']",PMC2919391,,2010/08/14 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0012040 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Aug 10;5(8):e12040. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0012040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL samples and cell lines derived from ATL patients show restricted sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and CD95 ligand (CD95L). We have recently shown that HTLV-1-infected cells express elevated levels of cellular caspase-8 FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) conferring resistance to receptor-mediated apoptosis. This finding underscores the demand to develop new strategies for treatment of ATL. In this study, we show that the naturally occurring herbal compound Rocaglamide (Roc) sensitizes CD95L- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected cells by downregulation of c-FLIP expression. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of Roc-mediated downregulation of c-FLIP revealed that it inhibits phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key factor that controls the rate-limiting step of translation, through inhibition of the MEK-ERK-MNK1 signaling pathway. This event prevents de novo synthesis of short-lived proteins such as c-FLIP in HTLV-1-infected cells. Our data suggest that Roc may serve as an adjuvant for TRAIL-based anticancer therapy.","['Bleumink, M', 'Kohler, R', 'Giaisi, M', 'Proksch, P', 'Krammer, P H', 'Li-Weber, M']","['Bleumink M', 'Kohler R', 'Giaisi M', 'Proksch P', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100813,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RBX1 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '84573-16-0 (rocaglamide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",PMC3131883,,2010/08/14 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201099 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2010.99 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2011 Feb;18(2):362-70. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2010.99.

Effective management of fatigue is essential for improving children's quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of a home-based aerobic exercise intervention to reduce fatigue in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: A 6-week home-based aerobic exercise intervention was implemented for children who were in the intervention group, whereas patients in the control group received routine care. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the effects of the aerobic exercise intervention on the children's self-reported levels of fatigue at posttest and 1-month follow-up. Two types of analysis were used: intent-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: This study was conducted with 22 children with ALL: 12 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group who were matched by age and sex. For per-protocol analysis, the finding indicated that children who received the exercise intervention reported significantly lower ""general fatigue"" subscale than those in the control group at the 1-month follow-up measurement. For intent-to-treat analysis, the findings indicated that there were no intervention and time effect for any of the 3 fatigue subscales at either posttest or 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The finding indicated that the exercise program is feasible and warrants being tested in a clinical trial with a much larger sample of children for ALL. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It suggests that a home-based exercise program may reduce fatigue for ALL children who are undergoing maintenance chemotherapy.","['Yeh, Chao Hsing', 'Man Wai, Jackson Pui', 'Lin, Un-Shan', 'Chiang, Yi-Chien']","['Yeh CH', 'Man Wai JP', 'Lin US', 'Chiang YC']","['School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Exercise/*psychology', 'Fatigue/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Home Care Services/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Compliance', 'Physical Fitness', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/14 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181e4553c [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2011 Jan-Feb;34(1):3-12. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181e4553c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to propagate such CICs from the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3. The SKOV3 sphere cells were selected using 40.0 micromol/l cisplatin and 10.0 micromol/l paclitaxel in serum-free culture system supplemented with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and insulin or standard serum-containing system. These cells formed non-adherent spheres under drug selection (cisplatin and paclitaxel) and serum-free culture system. The selected sphere cells are more resistant to cisplatin, paclitaxel, adriamycin, and methotrexate. Importantly, the sphere cells have the properties of self-renewal, with high expression of the stem cell genes Nanog, Oct4, sox2, nestin, ABCG2, CD133, and the stem cell factor receptor CD117 (c-kit). Consistently, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the sphere cells have a much higher percentage of CD133(+)/CD117(+)-positive cells (71%) than differentiated cells (33%). Moreover, the SKOV3 sphere cells are more tumorigenic. Furthermore, cDNA microarray and subsequent ontological analyses revealed that a large proportion of the classified genes were related to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation. The subpopulation isolation from the SKOV3 cell line under this culture system offers a suitable in vitro model for studying ovarian CSCs in terms of their survival, self-renewal, and chemoresistance, and for developing therapeutic drugs that specifically interfere with ovarian CSCs.","['Ma, Li', 'Lai, Dongmei', 'Liu, Te', 'Cheng, Weiwei', 'Guo, Lihe']","['Ma L', 'Lai D', 'Liu T', 'Cheng W', 'Guo L']","['Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100812,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2010/08/14 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gmq067 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmq067 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2010 Sep;42(9):593-602. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmq067.

Metanephric mesenchyme is a pluripotent renal stem population, and conversion of renal mesenchyme into epithelia depends on the ureteric bud in vivo and in vitro. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been induced to differentiate into a broad spectrum of specialized cell types in vitro, including hematopoietic, pancreatic, and neuronal cells. Such ES-derived cells can provide a valuable source of progenitor cells. However, whether ES cells can be stimulated by factors secreted from the fetal renal cells to differentiate into renal precursor cells in vitro has not been reported. In this study, we showed that murine ES cells can give rise to embryoid bodies in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. Culture conditions were optimized [6 days, 10 ng/ml activin and 10(-7) M retinoic acid (RA)] to generate maximal mesoderm populations specifically expressing Pax2 and brachyury. Results showed that 72% of the cells were brachyury positive by fluorescent activated cell sorter on Day 6 of EB cell differentiation. Conditioned medium collected from cultures of ureteric bud cells from renal cells of a 13-day-old fetus was added to the culture medium. Mesoderm cells were cultured for up to 10 days before showing expression of renal markers, initiation of nephrogenesis (WT-1 and Pax2), and terminally differentiated renal cell types (POD-1 and E-cadherin). This study suggests that ES cells pre-treated by RA and activin can interact with secreted molecules of the fetal renal cells to specifically differentiate into renal precursor cells. Our results provide an experimental basis for the development of in vitro assays to steer differentiation of ES cells toward renal lineages.","['Ren, Xiaohui', 'Zhang, Jingya', 'Gong, Xiaowen', 'Niu, Xin', 'Zhang, Xuejin', 'Chen, Peng', 'Zhang, Xuejun']","['Ren X', 'Zhang J', 'Gong X', 'Niu X', 'Zhang X', 'Chen P', 'Zhang X']","['Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100608,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', 'EQ43SC3GDB (Brachyury protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Proteins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Kidney/*cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Ureter/cytology']",,,2010/08/14 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['gmq046 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmq046 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2010 Jul;42(7):464-71. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmq046.

To investigate global control of alternative splicing in human cells, we analyzed splicing of mRNAs encoding Bcl2 family apoptosis factors in a genome-wide siRNA screen. The screen identified many regulators of Bcl-x and Mcl1 splicing, notably an extensive network of cell-cycle factors linked to aurora kinase A. Drugs or siRNAs that induce mitotic arrest promote proapoptotic splicing of Bcl-x, Mcl1, and caspase-9 and alter splicing of other apoptotic transcripts. This response precedes mitotic arrest, indicating coordinated upregulation of prodeath splice variants that promotes apoptosis in arrested cells. These shifts correspond to posttranslational turnover of splicing regulator ASF/SF2, which directly binds and regulates these target mRNAs and globally regulates apoptosis.

In AML patients the survival rate at 5 years is 40-50% highlighting the need for novel therapies. In this study we have asked whether IL-12, an immuno-modulatory cytokine with anti-tumor activity, may inhibit directly AML cell growth. We show that the human AML cell lines U937, K562 and THP-1 expressed both chains of the IL-12 receptor (R), i.e. IL-12Rbeta1 and IL-12Rbeta2. IL-12 inhibited the angiogenic potential of AML cells in vitro, but did not affect their survival or proliferation. In vivo experiments were performed using SCID-NOD mice injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the human U937 AML cell line and subsequently treated with human recombinant IL-12 or PBS i.p. Histological, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses on explanted tumors revealed that IL-12 reduced new vessel formation, induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation. Studies on a panel of angiogenesis related genes in explanted tumors using PCR arrays showed significantly down-regulated expression of numerous pro-angiogenic genes including VEGF-C, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL6 and alanyl aminopeptidase in IL-12 vs PBS treated mice.

We here present a novel low molecular weight kinase inhibitor, AKN-032, targeting the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and discovered in a new type of screening funnel combining the target therapy approach with sequential cellular screens. AKN-032 was identified among 150 selected hits from three different high throughput kinase screens. Further characterization showed inhibitory activity on FLT3 enzyme with an IC(50) of 70 nM. Western blot analysis revealed reduced autophosphorylation of the FLT3-receptor in AML cell line MV4-11 cells after exposure to AKN-032. Flow cytometry disclosed cytotoxic activity against MV4-11, but not against non-malignant 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells. Using a fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay, AKN-032 was tested against 15 cell lines and displayed a potent cytotoxic activity in AML cell lines MV4-11 (IC(50)=0.4 muM) and Kasumi-1 (IC(50)=2.3 muM). AKN-032 was also highly cytotoxic in tumor cells from AML patients in vitro. Furthermore, AKN-032 demonstrated significant antileukemic effect in a relatively resistant in vivo hollow fiber mouse model. No major toxicity was observed in the animals. In conclusion, AKN-032 is a promising new kinase inhibitor with significant in vivo and in vitro activity in AML. Results from the hollow fiber mouse assay suggest a favorable toxicity profile. Future studies will focus on pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity as well as further clarifying the mechanisms of action of AKN-032 in AML.","['Eriksson, Anna', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Lindhagen, Elin', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Hassan, Sadia Bashir', 'Ekholm, Carina', 'Fholenhag, Karin', 'Jensen, Annika Jenmalm', 'Lothgren, Agneta', 'Scobie, Martin', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Parrow, Vendela']","['Eriksson A', 'Hoglund M', 'Lindhagen E', 'Aleskog A', 'Hassan SB', 'Ekholm C', 'Fholenhag K', 'Jensen AJ', 'Lothgren A', 'Scobie M', 'Larsson R', 'Parrow V']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden. anna.eriksson@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100810,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (AKN 032)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '5049-61-6 (2-aminopyrazine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pyrazines/adverse effects/*chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2010/08/14 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00586-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Nov 15;80(10):1507-16. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.08.002.

The approach is common to all: identification of targets, establishment of models, definition of pre-requisites for clinical transfer and surrogate markers for evaluation of in vivo efficacy. We have used animal models of myeloid leukemia using a genetic approach in order to understand the biology of leukemogenesis and to develop targeted approaches to therapy. These models are now developed and are ready for testing various different therapeutic strategies. There are good molecular targets for other malignancies and several new drugs are in clinical trials. Our work on the development of DNA vaccines represents, what we hope will be, the beginning of a challenging era in immunotherapy. Our results in the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) model, a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), show that DNA vaccination combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) results in a survival advantage.","['Padua, Rose Ann', 'Chomienne, Christine']","['Padua RA', 'Chomienne C']","[""Department of Hematological Medicine, King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9NU, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,,,,,,2004/02/01 00:00,2004/02/01 00:01,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2004 Feb;4(20):41-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One truly tumor-specific protein, the mutant kinase BCR-ABL, single-handedly causes chronic myelogenous leukemia and is the target of the remarkably effective new drug Gleevec. However, BCR-ABL is very much the exception. The majority of new molecularly-targeted drugs, such as kinase inhibitors, aim to exploit the overexpression of a particular kinase in the tumors compared to the normal tissues. However, the pitfall in doing that is that these drugs are aimed at single biological targets, while the vast majority of advanced tumors harbor multiple genetic alterations that drive malignant growth. A newly emerging class of drugs, called heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors, can simultaneously destroy multiple tumor-causing proteins and also have a profound therapeutic selectivity for tumor cells over normal cells. Hsp90 belongs to a family of proteins called molecular chaperones that are involved in the stabilization and folding of many signaling proteins (collectively referred to as Hsp90 ""clients"") that are dysregulated in cancers. Hsp90 client proteins include key regulators of cell proliferation and survival such as receptor tyrosine kinases, metastable/mutant signaling proteins, transcription factors and cell cycle regulators (Table 1). Hsp90 client proteins are major components of mitogenic signaling pathways that drive cellular proliferation and survival signaling pathways that counteract programmed cell death (apoptosis). Thus, Hsp90 inhibition can concurrently destablize many oncoproteins in numerous signaling pathways, suggesting that Hsp90 inhibitor drugs would be advantageous in destroying cancer cells that can easily overcome the inhibition of a single target or pathway.","['Kamal, Adeela', 'Burrows, Francis J']","['Kamal A', 'Burrows FJ']","['Conforma Therapeutics Corporation, 9393 Towne Centre Drive, Suite 240, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,,,,,,2004/10/01 00:00,2004/10/01 00:01,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2004 Oct;4(23):277-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the past 35 years, this problem has been solved by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). With this strategy, normal marrow function can be restored by the transplanted blood-forming stem cells that are infused like a blood transfusion after high-dose chemotherapy. In allogeneic transplantation, the stem cells come from a healthy donor. In autologous transplantation, the cells are taken from the patient and frozen until they are infused after high-dose treatment has been completed. Along with killing malignant and non-malignant immune cells, the treatment given before HCT also kills other rapidly dividing healthy cells, often causing hair loss, mouth sores and sometimes other organ problems. The immune suppression caused by treatment leaves a patient vulnerable to viruses and bacterial infections. After transplantation, immune reconstitution and resolution of acute complications usually begin within two weeks, but other complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can continue for years. GVHD occurs when the transplanted allogeneic cells attack (attempt to reject) the host body.","['Syrjala, Karen L', 'Langer, Shelby', 'Abrams, Janet', 'Storer, Barry', 'Martin, Paul']","['Syrjala KL', 'Langer S', 'Abrams J', 'Storer B', 'Martin P']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,,,,,,2004/10/01 00:00,2004/10/01 00:01,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2004 Oct;4(23):263-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normalized per population size, this corresponds to a current mortality rate that is essentially identical to what it was in 1950 -- a very counterintuitive finding, given the exceptional progress recorded in the fundamental scientific understanding of malignant disease in the last 50 years. Dominant among the reasons for the unsatisfactory progress in the treatment of cancer is our general inability to treat metastatic colonies, when surgical intervention and radiation therapy are no longer available options. Systemic injection with chemical and biological agents is then the choice, with the yet-unsolved problem of selectivity in the intervention on cancer cell population, or the ability to kill cancer without causing intolerable levels of unwanted collateral effects on the patient. This treatment selectivity problem breaks down into three major, related components: the ability for the therapeutic substances to reach the cancer lesion, to recognize it as the target of its action, and to perform the therapeutic intervention solely at the site of the lesion. Many approaches have been developed to address these questions, and have met with different degrees of success. Particularly promising are the recent clinical advances recorded in the field of the so-called molecularly targeted therapies, which intervene in an exquisitely selective fashion on cancer-associated biological features, such as mutations in the receptor of epidermal growth factor in cancers of epithelial origin, or the activation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase pathway in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Ferrari, Mauro']",['Ferrari M'],"['The Ohio State University, 473 West 12th Ave., Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Discov Med,Discovery medicine,101250006,,,,,,2005/08/01 00:00,2005/08/01 00:01,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2005/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Discov Med. 2005 Aug;5(28):363-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Immunophenotyping was performed by three-color flow cytometry analysis using CD45 /SSC gating in 23 children with newly diagnosed T-ALL. Meanwhile cytogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: CD3(+) expression of T-lineage antigens was apparently higher than CD7(+) and CD5(+) expression. CD19(+) expression of B-lineage antigens was apparently higher than CD22(+), CD10(+) and CD20(+) expression. Myeloid antigen was expressed in 4 cases (17%). CD34(+) and HLA-DR(+) were observed in 4 cases (17%) and 5 cases (22%), respectively. cCD3(+) and cCD79(+) were expressed in 23 cases (100%) and 22 cases (96%), respectively. The chromosome detection in 8 cases with T-ALL showed hyperdiploid or Ph(+) chromosome (one case each). The fusion gene detection in 5 cases showed MLL rearrangements in two cases and positive SIL/TAL1 fusion gene in one case. CD3 expression was related with the complete remission rate.

We previously found that cell growth suppressing retinoid CD437 enhanced expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 and DNA damage inducible GADD45 proteins in part by elevating their mRNA stability. RESULTS: Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms of CD437-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. By utilizing MDA-MB-468 HBC cells expressing chimeric rabbit beta-globin-p21WAF1/CIP1 transcripts we mapped multiple CD437-responsive sequences located within positions 1195 to 1795 of the 3'-untranslated region of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA. Several cytoplasmic proteins present in MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 HBC as well as HL-60R leukemia cells bound specifically, in vitro, with these CD437-responsive sequences. CD437 treatment of cells resulted in elevated binding of ~85 kD and ~55 kD cytoplasmic proteins with putative CD437-responsive sequences. A 12 nt RNA sequence (5'-UGUGGUGGCACA-3') present within CD437-responsive region of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA displayed specific and elevated binding with the above noted proteins. Treatment of cells with ActD or CHX prior to CD437 exposure did not abrogate RNA-protein interactions. However, treatment of cytoplasmic protein extracts with proteinase K or alkaline phosphatase resulted in loss of RNA-protein interactions. CONCLUSIONS: CD437 regulates cell growth in part by regulating stability of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA that involves specific RNA-protein interactions that are phosphorylation-dependent, while not requiring nascent transcription or protein synthesis.","['Zhang, Liyue', 'Wali, Anil', 'Fontana, Joseph A', 'Dawson, Marcia I', 'Rishi, Arun K']","['Zhang L', 'Wali A', 'Fontana JA', 'Dawson MI', 'Rishi AK']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and John D, Dingell VA Medical Center, Room B4325, 4646 John R, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.

RESULTS: The significantly decreased level of GRAF transcript was observed in three myeloid malignancies compared to controls. Within AML, there was no difference in the level of GRAF transcript among different FAB subtypes (P > 0.05). Difference was not observed in the amount of GRAF mRNA between CML at chronic phase and controls. As CML progressed, GRAF transcript significantly decreased. In MDS, three cases with 5q deletion had lower GRAF transcript than four without 5q deletion (median 0.76 vs 2.99) (P > 0.05).

METHODS: In this prospective non-comparative study, 205 consecutive patients, who were diagnosed as primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction, were included. Patients with history of trauma and/ or surgery in the periorbital area, punctum or canalicular obstruction were excluded from the study. Patients were evaluated for age, gender, history, and presenting symptoms. Lacrimal drainage system abnormalities were assessed. Lacrimal system irrigation, dacryocystography, and in selected cases dacryoscintigraphy was performed. All patients underwent external dacryocystorhinostomy. Biopsy specimens were obtained from the posterior inferior flap and examined by the same pathologist. RESULTS: Forty-seven male and 158 females with age ranging from 6 to 81 years (mean 47.5 +/- 16.2 years) were included in the study. Only one patient had the diagnosis of chronic leukemia, others had no preexisting history of systemic disease. Pathologic examination revealed chronic inflammation (n= 178), fibrosis without inflammation (n= 19), normal mucosa (n= 4), and lymphoid hyperplasia (n= 1). Three patients had abnormal pathology: Lymphoproliferative disease in the patient with chronic leukemia, granulomatous inflammation, and basosquamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: In primary nasolacrimal duct obstruction, pathological examination of the lacrimal sac revealed chronic inflammatory changes in most patients. Even though rare, malignant or systemic disease in patients with neither specific history nor clinical or radiological finding might be observed in these cases. Thus, we recommend taking biopsy if any suspicion of abnormality of the lacrimal sac exists.","['Altan-Yaycioglu, Rana', 'Canan, Handan', 'Sizmaz, Selcuk', 'Bal, Nebil', 'Pelit, Aysel', 'Akova, Yonca A']","['Altan-Yaycioglu R', 'Canan H', 'Sizmaz S', 'Bal N', 'Pelit A', 'Akova YA']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Baskent University, Yuregir, Adana 01250, Turkey. raltanya@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100812,England,Orbit,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8301221,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Dacryocystorhinostomy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases/diagnosis', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasolacrimal Duct/*pathology/surgery', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/14 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01676831003739699 [doi]'],ppublish,Orbit. 2010 Oct;29(5):254-8. doi: 10.3109/01676831003739699.

LCMS and HPLC data show the PEG pentasulfane ring structure predominates, and the tri-, tetra-, hexa-, hepta-, and nonasulfanes were present at very low concentrations. The presence of the PEG group improved water solubility by 50-fold compared to the unsubstituted benzopolysulfanes, C(6)H(4)S(x) (x = 3, 5, and 7), based on intrinsic solubility measurements. Polysulfur linkages in the PEG compounds decomposed in the presence of ethanethiol and hydroxide ion. The PEG pentathiepin desulfurated rapidly, and an S(3) transfer reaction was observed in the presence of norbornene; no S(2) transfer reaction was observed with 2,3-dimethylbutadiene. The antitumor activities of the PEG-substituted benzopolysulfane mixtures were analyzed against four human tumor cell lines PC3 (prostate), DU145 (prostate), MDA-MB-231 (breast), and Jurkat (T-cell leukemia). The PEG-conjugated polysulfanes had IC(50) values 1.2-5.8 times lower than the parent ""unsubstituted"" benzopolysulfanes. Complete cell killing was observed for the PEG polysulfanes at 4 microM for PC3 and DU145 cells and at 12 muM for MDA-MB-231 cells. The results suggest that solubilization of the polysulfur linkage is a key parameter to the success of these compounds as drug leads.","['Mahendran, Adaickapillai', 'Vuong, Angela', 'Aebisher, David', 'Gong, Yaqiong', 'Bittman, Robert', 'Arthur, Gilbert', 'Kawamura, Akira', 'Greer, Alexander']","['Mahendran A', 'Vuong A', 'Aebisher D', 'Gong Y', 'Bittman R', 'Arthur G', 'Kawamura A', 'Greer A']","['Department of Chemistry, Brooklyn College of The City University of New York, Brooklyn, New York 11210, USA.']",['eng'],"['SC1 GM093830/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'SC1 GM093830-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'SC1GM093830/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL083187/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Org Chem,The Journal of organic chemistry,2985193R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Ethylamines)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Sulfur Compounds)', '0 (varacin A)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Factors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethylamines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Sulfides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sulfur Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC3329777,['NIHMS225140'],2010/08/14 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jo100870q [doi]'],ppublish,J Org Chem. 2010 Aug 20;75(16):5549-57. doi: 10.1021/jo100870q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phase I clinical trial was designed to evaluate safety (primary endpoint) and possible clinical efficacy (secondary endpoint) of repetitive administrations of allogeneic, in vitro activated and expanded NK cells along with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with unresectable, locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC receiving 1st/2nd line chemotherapy were eligible to receive 2-4 doses of activated NK cells from two relative donors. Donor's CD56(+) cells were cultured for 20-23 days with interleukin-15 (IL-15) and hydrocortisone (HC) and administered intravenously between chemotherapy cycles. Premedication with corticosteroids and/or H1 inhibitors was allowed. Sixteen patients (performance status 0-1) with adenocarcinoma (n = 13) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3) at stage IIIb (n = 5) or IV (n = 11) receiving 1st (n = 13) or 2nd (n = 3) line treatment were enrolled. Fifteen patients received 2-4 doses of allogeneic activated NK cells (0.2-29 x 10(6)/kg/dose, median 4.15 x 10(6)/kg/dose). No side effects (local or systemic) were observed. At a median 22-month follow-up (range, 16.5-26 months) 2 patients with partial response and 6 patients with disease stabilization were recorded. Median progression free survival and overall survival were 5.5 and 15 months, respectively. A 56% 1-year survival and a 19% 2-year survival were recorded.

In a wide range of hematological malignancies, the mTORC1 signaling pathway has been found to be deregulated and has been designed as a major target for tumor therapy. Given that pre-clinical studies have clearly established the therapeutic value of mTORC1 inhibition, numerous clinical trials of rapamycin and its derivates (rapalogs) are ongoing for treatment of these diseases. At this time, although disease stabilization and tumor regression have been observed, objective responses in some tumor types have been modest. Nevertheless, some of the mechanisms underlying cancer-cell resistance to rapamycin have now been described, thereby leading to the development of new strategy to efficiently target mTOR signaling in these diseases. In this review, we discuss the rationale for using mTOR inhibitors as novel therapies for a variety of hematological, malignancies with a focus on promising new perspectives for these approaches.","['Chapuis, N', 'Tamburini, J', 'Green, A S', 'Willems, L', 'Bardet, V', 'Park, S', 'Lacombe, C', 'Mayeux, P', 'Bouscary, D']","['Chapuis N', 'Tamburini J', 'Green AS', 'Willems L', 'Bardet V', 'Park S', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D']","[""Departement d'Immunologie-Hematologie, Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100812,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,,2010/08/13 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010170 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.170 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1686-99. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.170.

In contrast, OS was significantly worse for MM (37% (29-48) P=0.005) due to a significant excess of transplant-related mortality. Also OS worsened significantly when EBMT risk score increased.

BCR-ABL breakpoints were identified in p190 ALL (n=25), p210 ALL (n=25) and p210 CML (n=32); reciprocal breakpoints were identified in 54 cases. No evidence for significant clustering and no association with sequence motifs was found except for a breakpoint deficit in repeat regions within BCR for p210 cases. Comparison of reciprocal breakpoints, however, showed differences in the patterns of deletion/insertions between p190 and p210. To explore the possibility that recombinase-activating gene (RAG) activity might be involved in ALL, we performed extra-chromosomal recombination assays for cases with breakpoints close to potential cryptic recombination signal sequence (cRSS) sites. Of 13 ALL cases tested, 1/10 with p190 and 1/3 with p210 precisely recapitulated the forward BCR-ABL breakpoint and 1/10 with p190 precisely recapitulated the reciprocal breakpoint. In contrast, neither of the p210 CMLs tested showed functional cRSSs. Thus, although the t(9;22) does not arise from aberrant variable (V), joining (J) and diversity (D) (V(D)J) recombination, our data suggest that in a subset of ALL cases RAG might create one of the initiating double-strand breaks.","['Score, J', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Ottman, O', 'Pane, F', 'Yeh, R F', 'Sobrinho-Simoes, M A', 'Kreil, S', 'Ward, D', 'Hidalgo-Curtis, C', 'Melo, J V', 'Wiemels, J', 'Nadel, B', 'Cross, N C P', 'Grand, F H']","['Score J', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Ottman O', 'Pane F', 'Yeh RF', 'Sobrinho-Simoes MA', 'Kreil S', 'Ward D', 'Hidalgo-Curtis C', 'Melo JV', 'Wiemels J', 'Nadel B', 'Cross NC', 'Grand FH']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury and Human Genetics Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100812,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2010/08/13 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010174 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.174 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1742-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.174.

This mobilization process may be envisioned as a danger-sensing response mechanism triggered by hypoxia or mechanical or infection-induced tissue damage that recruits into PB different types of stem cells that have a role in immune surveillance and organ/tissue regeneration. Mobilization is also significantly enhanced by the administration of pharmacological agents, which has been exploited in hematological transplantology as a means to obtain HSPCs for hematopoietic reconstitution.

We have previously reported that a pan-JAK inhibitor caused ERK-dependent endoreduplication. In the current study we find that JAK inhibition caused nuclear re-localization of RAF-1 which could be inhibited by RAF inhibitor GW5074. GW5074 also inhibited JAK inhibitor-induced appearance of nuclear phosphorylated RAF-1(pS621RAF) and MEK; and it inhibited the JAK inhibitor-induced co-immunoprecipitation of nuclear RAF-1 and MEK. JAK inhibition also increased nuclear BubR1 phosphorylation, which was diminished by RAF inhibitor GW5074. RAF-1 and BubR1 in the nucleus co-immunoprecipitated; and GW5074 eliminated this. Furthermore, inhibiting RAF with GW5074 blocked the pan-JAK inhibitor-induced endoreduplication. These data thus show that JAK inhibition causes nuclear relocalization and phosphorylation of RAF and MEK where RAF binds BubR1 with ensuing nuclear RAF-dependent BubR1 phosphorylation. Inhibiting RAF inhibited this and endoreduplication. The results suggest that there is a JAK/RAF/MEK/BubR1 axis that can regulate genomic stability. In this hypothetical model JAK suppresses RAF/MEK phosphorylation and nuclear re-localization, but JAK inhibition induces the phosphorylations and relocalization with association of RAF and phosphorylated BubR1 in the nucleus leading to endoreduplication.","['Reiterer, Gudrun', 'Chen, Lihua', 'Tassef, Ryan', 'Varner, Jeffery D', 'Chen, Chang-Yan', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Reiterer G', 'Chen L', 'Tassef R', 'Varner JD', 'Chen CY', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100810,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (5-iodo-3-((3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methylene)-2-indolinone)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bub1 spindle checkpoint protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Genomic Instability', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",PMC3230478,,2010/08/13 06:00,2011/01/19 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['12631 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.16.12631 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Aug 15;9(16):3297-304. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.16.12631.

Autophagy is activated under stress conditions induced by nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and drug treatments. Morphologically, autophagic cells are characterized by the accumulation of double membrane cytoplasmic vesicules called autophagosomes that surrounds cytoplasmic proteins and/or organelles. Autophagosomes next fuse with lysosomes to generate autolysosomes, the structures in which the retained constituents are digested before recycling into the cytoplasm. In this context, autophagy promotes cell survival under adverse conditions. In contrast, under certain circumstances autophagic cells may engage a specific mode of cell death called type II cell death or autophagic cell death (ACD). Considering the strategic positionnement of this process at the crossroads of cell death and survival, it is not surprising that defects in autophagy have been linked to a plethora of human diseases, including hematopoietic malignancies. Finally, autophagy induction is repressed by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and favored by the adenosine-monophosphate activated-protein kinase (AMPK). In the present review, we focus on the functions of autophagy in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and discuss the opportunity to target the AMPK/mTOR pathways as a new therapeutic strategy to fight hematopoietic malignancies with a special emphasis on Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML).","['Puissant, Alexandre', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Puissant A', 'Robert G', 'Auberger P']","[""INSERM U895, Batiment Universitaire ARCHIMED, CHU Hopital de l'Archet, Nice Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100915,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,['EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)'],IM,"['*Autophagy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,,2010/08/13 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['13048 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.17.13048 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Sep 1;9(17):3470-8. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.17.13048.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a combination of receptor-specific agonists and antagonists we identified S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) as the major S1P receptor subtype that regulates SMC differentiation marker gene expression. Based on the known coupling properties of S1PR2 and our demonstration that overexpression of Galpha(12) or Galpha(13) increased SMC-specific promoter activity, we next tested whether the effects of S1P in SMC were mediated by the regulator of G protein-signaling-Rho guanine exchange factors (RGS-RhoGEFs) (leukemia-associated RhoGEF [LARG], PDZ-RhoGEF [PRG], RhoGEF [p115]). Although each of the RGS-RhoGEFs enhanced actin polymerization, myocardin-related transcription factor-A nuclear localization, and SMC-specific promoter activity when overexpressed in 10T1/2 cells, LARG exhibited the most robust effect and was the only RGS-RhoGEF activated by S1P in SMC. Importantly, siRNA-mediated depletion of LARG significantly inhibited the activation of RhoA and SMC differentiation marker gene expression by S1P. Knockdown of LARG had no effect on SMC proliferation but promoted SMC migration as measured by scratch wound and transwell assays. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that S1PR2-dependent activation of RhoA in SMC is mediated by LARG and that this signaling mechanism promotes the differentiated SMC phenotype.","['Medlin, Matt D', 'Staus, Dean P', 'Dubash, Adi D', 'Taylor, Joan M', 'Mack, Christopher P']","['Medlin MD', 'Staus DP', 'Dubash AD', 'Taylor JM', 'Mack CP']","['Department of Pathology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL070953-06A2/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-071054/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL102446/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-082883/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-070953/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-046369/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'E507017-34/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 HL070953/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100811,United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors)', '0 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-2, mouse)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RhoA protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysophospholipids/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",PMC2930832,['NIHMS221862'],2010/08/13 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.110.209395 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.209395 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2010 Sep;30(9):1779-86. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.209395.

The receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) was identified as a highly expressed gene in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), but not normal B cells, suggesting it may serve as a tumor-specific target for therapy. We analyzed ROR1-expression in normal nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cells including B-cell precursors, and in hematopoietic malignancies. ROR1 has characteristics of an oncofetal gene and is expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, B-CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, but not in major adult tissues apart from low levels in adipose tissue and at an early stage of B-cell development. We constructed a ROR1-specific chimeric antigen receptor that when expressed in T cells from healthy donors or CLL patients conferred specific recognition of primary B-CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, including rare drug effluxing chemotherapy resistant tumor cells that have been implicated in maintaining the malignancy, but not mature normal B cells. T-cell therapies targeting ROR1 may be effective in B-CLL and other ROR1-positive tumors.

To investigate the effect of CYP3A4 induction and inhibition on nilotinib pharmacokinetics, 2 studies were conducted in healthy volunteers prior to and following treatment with a strong inducer (rifampin) or inhibitor (ketoconazole). In the induction study, administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 8 days significantly increased urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/ cortisol ratio, from a preinduction baseline of 5.8 +/- 2.7 to 18.0 +/- 10.2 after 8 days of rifampin treatment, confirming an inductive effect on CYP3A4. Nilotinib oral clearance was increased by 4.8-fold, and the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) were decreased by 64% and 80%, respectively, in the induced state compared with baseline. In the inhibition study, ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 6 days increased the C(max) and AUC of nilotinib by 1.8- and 3-fold, respectively, compared with nilotinib alone.

IDH1 is a metabolic gene, and the R132 mutations create a new enzymatic activity. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether IDH1 had somatically acquired mutations in thyroid carcinomas. DESIGN: Exons 4 and 6 of IDH1 were sequenced in a large panel of thyroid tumours (n=138) and compared with the patients normal DNA (n=26). We also correlated IDH1 mutations with clinical-pathological data and BRAF and RAS mutational status. RESULTS: We identified four novel and two previously described non-synonymous variants in thyroid carcinomas, which were absent in benign tumours and paired normal thyroid. Although IDH1 variants occurred at higher frequency in follicular thyroid carcinomas, follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas than the observed variants in classical PTC (15/72 vs 3/37), it was not significant (P=0.1). Sequence alignment across several species shows that all IDH1 genetic alterations occurred at evolutionarily conserved residues located within the active site, and therefore, are likely to affect protein function. Unlike other tumours, IDH1 and BRAF or RAS mutations are not mutually exclusive. There was no association between IDH1 mutational status and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: IDH1-acquired genetic alterations are highly prevalent in thyroid carcinomas (16%). Our findings not only extend our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying pathogenesis of thyroid tumours, but also emphasize the biological differences between tumour types. Those tumours with IDH1 mutations might benefit from therapies that exploit this alteration.","['Hemerly, Jefferson Pessoa', 'Bastos, Andre Uchimura', 'Cerutti, Janete M']","['Hemerly JP', 'Bastos AU', 'Cerutti JM']","['Laboratorio Bases Geneticas dos Tumores da Tiroide, Disciplinas de Genetica e Endocrinologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Rua Pedro de Toledo 669, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100811,England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

PML conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is required for its localization within NBs. PML displays antiviral effects in vivo, as PML deficiency renders mice more susceptible to infection with the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Cells derived from these mice are also more sensitive to infection with rabies virus, another member of the rhabdovirus family. Alternative splicing from a single gene results in the synthesis of several PML isoforms, and these are classified into seven groups, designated PMLI to -VII. We report here that expression of PMLIV or PMLIVa, which is missing exon 5, inhibited viral mRNA and protein synthesis, leading to a reduction in viral replication. However, the expression of other nuclear isoforms (PMLI to -VI) and cytoplasmic PMLVIIb failed to impair viral production. This antiviral effect required PMLIV SUMOylation, as it was not observed with PMLIV 3KR, in which the lysines involved in SUMO conjugation were mutated.

It is unclear whether CD317 expressed endogenously in rodent cells has the capacity to interfere with the replication of the retroviral rodent pathogen murine leukemia virus (MLV) or, in the context of small-animal model development, contributes to the well-established late-phase restriction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CD317 relieved a virion release restriction and markedly enhanced the egress of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rat cells, including primary macrophages. Moreover, rodent CD317 potently inhibited MLV release, and siRNA-mediated depletion of CD317 in a mouse T-cell line resulted in the accelerated spread of MLV. Several virus-encoded antagonists have recently been reported to overcome the restriction imposed by human or monkey CD317, including HIV-1 Vpu, envelope glycoproteins of HIV-2 and Ebola virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K5, and SIV Nef. In contrast, both rat and mouse CD317 showed a high degree of resistance to these viral antagonists. These data suggest that CD317 is a broadly acting and conserved mediator of innate control of retroviral infection and pathogenesis that restricts the release of retroviruses and lentiviruses in rodents. The high degree of resistance of the rodent CD317 restriction factors to antagonists from primate viruses has implications for HIV-1 small-animal model development and may guide the design of novel antiviral interventions.","['Goffinet, Christine', 'Schmidt, Sarah', 'Kern, Christian', 'Oberbremer, Lena', 'Keppler, Oliver T']","['Goffinet C', 'Schmidt S', 'Kern C', 'Oberbremer L', 'Keppler OT']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100811,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (BST2 protein, human)', '0 (Bst2 protein, rat)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Macrophages/virology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Primates', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rodentia', '*Virus Replication']",PMC2953199,,2010/08/13 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01067-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01067-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Nov;84(21):11374-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01067-10.

In the present study, Gyp were used to examine effects on cell viability, cell cycle, and induction of apoptosis in vitro. They were administered in the diet to mice injected with WEHI-3 cells in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Effects of Gyp on WEHI-3 cells were determined by flow cytometric assay and Western blotting. RESULTS: Gyp inhibited the growth of WEHI-3 cells. These effects were associated with the induction of G0/G1 arrest, morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, and increased sub-G1 phase. Gyp promoted the production of reactive oxygen species, increased Ca(2+) levels, and induced the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The effects of Gyp were dose and time dependent. Moreover, Gyp increased levels of the proapoptotic protein Bax, reduced levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, and stimulated release of cytochrome c, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), and Endo G (endonuclease G) from mitochondria. The levels of GADD153, GRP78, ATF6-alpha, and ATF4-alpha were increased by Gyp, resulting in ER (endoplasmic reticular) stress in WEHI-3 cells. Oral consumption of Gyp increased the survival rate of mice injected with WEHI-3 cells used as a mouse model of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Results of these experiments provide new information on understanding mechanisms of Gyp-induced effects on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in an in vivo animal model.","['Hsu, Hui-Ying', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Lu, Kung-Wen', 'Yu, Chun-Shu', 'Chou, Su-Tze', 'Lin, Jen-Jyh', 'Chen, Ya-Yin', 'Lin, Meng-Liang', 'Chueh, Fu-Shin', 'Chen, Shih-Shun', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Hsu HY', 'Yang JS', 'Lu KW', 'Yu CS', 'Chou ST', 'Lin JJ', 'Chen YY', 'Lin ML', 'Chueh FS', 'Chen SS', 'Chung JG']","['China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100811,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Atf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Atf6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (gypenoside)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endonuclease G)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/metabolism', 'Activating Transcription Factor 6/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gynostemma/chemistry', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",,,2010/08/13 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1534735410377198 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735410377198 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2011 Mar;10(1):101-12. doi: 10.1177/1534735410377198.

APL diagnosis is considered a medical emergency. As reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PML-RAR fusion oncoprotein is time consuming, there is a need for a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for APL. This study evaluates the role of PG-M3 monoclonal antibody using immunofluorescence (IF) in the early diagnosis of APL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six new untreated APL cases diagnosed with RT-PCR for PML-RAR as the gold standard and 38 non-APL controls (28 non-APL AMLs and 10 non-leukaemic samples) were evaluated by routine morphology and cytochemistry, RT-PCR and IF using PG-M3 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Using IF, 34 of 36 (94.4%) APL cases showed a microgranular pattern suggestive of APL and two cases (5.6%) showed a speckled pattern typical of wild-type PML protein (False negative). By comparison, two of 28 (7.1%) non-APL AMLs showed microgranular pattern (false positive). Hence, IF as a diagnostic test for APL resulted in a sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 92.9% and positive and negative predictive values of 94.4% and 92.9% respectively. All 10 non-leukaemic samples showed a speckled pattern. CONCLUSIONS: IF using PG-M3 antibodies can be used as a rapid (takes 2 h), cheap, sensitive and specific method to identify APL. It can be a useful adjunct for diagnosis of APL especially if facilities for RT-PCR are not available, particularly in resource-limited settings.","['Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Gupta SK', 'Sazawal S', 'Mahapatra M', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/economics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/13 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2344 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02344.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2010 Oct;40(10):960-2. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02344.x.,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Compared to MM, organ invasion is common in PCL, while soft tissue tumors involving the head, neck or paraspinal area are common sites for MEP. Markers of poor prognosis are frequently observed in these extramedullary forms of plasma cell cancers, and survival is significantly inferior compared to patients with MM. Conventional chemotherapeutic and radiotherapy approaches have been employed with variable results. Even high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue has not been able to demonstrate consistent improvement in survival outcome.

Co-administration of parthenolide blocked HDACI-mediated phosphorylation/activation of IKK and RelA/p65 in association with increased JNK1 activation in various AML cell types. These events were accompanied by an increase in apoptosis in multiple AML cell lines (e.g. U937, HL-60, NB4, MV-4-11, and MOLM-13). Significantly, parthenolide also increased HDACI-mediated cell death in haematopoietic cells transduced with the MLL-MLLT1 fusion gene, which exhibit certain leukaemia-initiating cell characteristics, as well as primary AML blasts. Exposure to parthenolide/HDACI regimens clearly inhibited the growth of AML-colony-forming units but was relatively sparing toward normal haematopoietic progenitors. Notably, blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling by either pharmacological inhibitors or genetic means (e.g. dominant-negative JNK1 or JNK1 shRNA) diminished parthenolide/HDACI-mediated lethality. Moreover, dominant-negative MKK7, but not dominant-negative MKK4/SEK1, blocked JNK1 activation and apoptosis induced by parthenolide/HDACI regimens. Together, these findings indicate that parthenolide potentiates HDACI lethality in human AML cells through a process involving NF-kappaB inhibition and subsequent MKK7-dependent activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway. They also raise the possibility that this strategy may target leukaemic progenitor cells.","['Dai, Yun', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Wang, Li', 'Yeung, Sin-Kei', 'Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Dent, Paul', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Guzman ML', 'Chen S', 'Wang L', 'Yeung SK', 'Pei XY', 'Dent P', 'Jordan CT', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, 401 College Street, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA130805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA141703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 P50 CA130805-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA150214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100802,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sesquiterpenes/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2950247,['NIHMS225049'],2010/08/13 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8319 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08319.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Oct;151(1):70-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08319.x.

Here we review the current diagnostic criteria of genetic abnormalities in precursor B-ALL (BCP-ALL), including the relevant technical approaches and the application of the most appropriate methods for the detection of each abnormality. The abnormalities with the most significant impact for treatment and management of BCP-ALL are t(9;22)(q34;q11)/BCR-ABL1, t(4;11)(q21;q23)/MLL-AFF1 and near-haploidy/low hypodiploidy for high risk stratification and, to a lesser extent, t(12;21)(p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 and high hyperdiploidy for good risk management. Apart from the numerical abnormalities, these can be routinely tested for by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, providing a basic yet informative screen. However, cytogenetics, particularly fluorescence in situ hybridization may provide reliable alternative detection methods dependent upon the preferred technical approach within each protocol.","['Harrison, Christine J', 'Haas, Oskar', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Trka, Jan', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Harrison CJ', 'Haas O', 'Harbott J', 'Biondi A', 'Stanulla M', 'Trka J', 'Izraeli S']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. christine.harrison@newcastle.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",,,2010/08/13 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/13 06:00'],"['2010/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8314 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08314.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Oct;151(2):132-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08314.x.,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,"['Biology and Diagnosis Committee of International Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster study', 'group']",,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 413 smears of from various tumor mass compartments-bone marrow, peripheral blood and lymph node-were analyzed in CLLPD as a whole, as well as separately in the B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia with variants (B-CLL+V). The analysis of the diploid histogram included percentage of cells at the peak of the DNA histogram and percentage of cells with lower and higher contents of DNA than cells at the peak. The new types of AgNORs were described as homogeneous, inhomogeneous and annular. RESULTS: The newly introduced parameters of DNA and AgNOR are significant predictors of survival. Based on the most representative AgNOR and DNA characteristics related to survival, the PKI score was calculated. The CLLPD and B-CLL+V patients had a statistically significantly better prognosis when PKI was < 4.

Seventy cases were diagnosed as CLL, 14 as HCL and 7 as miscellaneous. Sixty-nine CLL cases showed typical CLL immunophenotype. Thirteen HCL cases revealed typical HCL immunophenotype. Rai and Binet staging systems were applied, and the correlation of various stages with other prognostic parameters like BM trephine biopsy patterns, CD38 positivity, serum lactic dehydrogenase level, lymphocyte doubling time and Coomb's test was analyzed. BM infiltration pattern showed significant statistical correlation with staging systems.

STUDY DESIGN: We measured neovascular surface density (CD34 endothelial marker) in the 10 most labeled fields (hVA), cellularity (CA) and the percentage of avascular fields (AVF) in bone marrow biopsy specimens from 34 patients with CLL. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assayed in thawed serum samples from 8 of the 23 untreated patients (12 Rai stage 0, 6 Rai stage I-II, 5 Binet stage B-C). RESULTS: Neoangiogenesis hVA was lower in the 12 stage O patients (p < 0.039) and in the 6 patients with nodular interstitial mixed infiltration (p = 0.058). The link between hVA and serum VEGF (sVEGF) was negative in 8 patients (R = -0.49, -0.70 for a given age). Age was linked to moderate interstitial infiltration (p < 0.02), AVF (R = 0.37) and lower sVEGF levels (R = -0.676). The blood platelet count showed numerous correlations, including links with AVF (R = 0.40), low hVA (R = -0.38), female sex (p = 0.068), absence of splenomegaly (p < 0.001), mixed-type infiltration (p < 0.01) and sVEGF (R = 0.38, 0.61 for a given age). CONCLUSION: The links revealed by the iconography of correlations were described statistically. Surprisingly, negative links of hVA with the sVEGF level, 2 known prognostic factors, on the one hand, and with the blood platelet count, on the other hand, were found. The direct link between disease progression and the amount of avascular hematopoietic tissue (NS), not previously described, will require further study.

Many systemic diseases have oral manifestations which may appear at the beginning of any developed pathology, thus early detection can occasionally occur at the dental clinic. Gingival lesions are the most common oral phenomenon known for leukemia and HIV infection. In this case an early detection of pathology at the dental clinic was based on an uncommon and single presenting sign of massive spontaneous gingival bleeding. The objectives are demonstrate this unusual sign of blood dyscrasia and HIV infection in oral cavity and establishing management and prevention of oral manifestations for blood dyscrasia and pathology with viral etiology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We investigated 225 cases had pathology with viral etiology. The patients entered the study HIV/AIDS in Botosani, Suceava, Neami during 2004-2008. All patients had a detailed medical history and examination as well as a thorough oral examination, which were all done without prior knowledge of the patient's HIV serostatus. RESULTS: Oral disease is frequently associated with HIV. While nearly all oral disorders associated with HIV infection also occur in other conditions characterized by immunosuppression, no other condition is associated with as wide and significant a spectrum of oral disease as is HIV infection. Many HIV associated oral disorders occur early in HIV infection, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of associated oral disease should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Likewise, awareness of the variety of oral disorders which can develop throughout the course of HIV infection, and coordination of health care services between physician and dentist, should improve overall health and comfort of the patient. This paper reviews the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of HIV associated oral disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Diseases with a particular viral etiology infectiousness have a special resurgence. For the dentist, their recognition has a particularly importance for the quick and accurate determination of the diagnose and for the establishing, together with the infectious disease physician, of the appropriate treatment. Working with the department of epidemiology is useful to define the preventive measures among the community.","['Tabarcea, I C', 'Neagu, I', 'Vataman, R']","['Tabarcea IC', 'Neagu I', 'Vataman R']","['Universitatii de Medicina si Farmacie Gr.T.

Up to 37.2% of all patients receiving cancer chemotherapy develop acute oral complications and up to 31.1% of all patients receiving cancer radiotherapy develop acute oral manifestations. Oral complications may result in significant morbidity, impaired nutrition, treatment delays, and dose reductions which are affecting the prognosis of the primary disease. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We investigated 312 cases of blood dyscrasia which 296 cases had oral manifestations (86.2%). They had a mean age of 40,6 years (range from 7 to 86 years). The male to female ratio was 1.0:0.75 (178/134). Data were statistically analyzed by t test, chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis and two-tailed exact Fischer, using the SPSS program, at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Oral complications are frequently encountered in patients receiving anticancer therapy and these complications may result in significant morbidity, treatment delays, dose reductions, and nutritional deficiencies. The acute effects of anticancer chemotherapy upon the oral cavity include mucositis, infection, hemorrhage, xerostomia and nutritional deficiencies. Patients which undergo radiotherapy, specific in head and neck carcinomas, display a 30-60% incidence of the oral manifestations. The antineoplastic therapy will interfere with the turnover of the epithelial cells, followed by mucosal injury, later by infections, due to indirect invasion of Gram-negative bacteria and fungal species, as most of the anti-cancer drugs cause immunological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The mucosal surface that is the oral cavity may provide insight into the immune function of the patient.

Due to internalization of DU during military operations and the ensuing chronic internal exposure to DU, there are concerns regarding its potential health effects. Preconceptional paternal irradiation has been implicated as a causal factor in childhood cancer and it has been suggested that this paternal exposure to radiation may play a role in the occurrence of leukemia and other cancers to offspring. Similarly, in vivo heavy metal studies have demonstrated that carcinogenic effects can occur in unexposed offspring. Using a transgenic mouse system employing a lambda shuttle vector allowing mutations (in the lacI gene) to be analyzed in vitro, we have investigated the possibility that chronic preconceptional paternal DU exposure can lead to transgenerational transmission of genomic instability. The mutation frequencies in vector recovered from the bone marrow cells of the F1 offspring of male parents exposed to low, medium, and high doses of internalized DU for 7 mo were evaluated and compared to control, tantalum, nickel, and gamma radiation F1 samples. Results demonstrate that as paternal DU-dose increased there was a trend towards higher mutation frequency in vector recovered from the DNA obtained from bone marrow of F1 progeny; medium and high dose DU exposure to P1 fathers resulted in a significant increase in mutation frequency in F1 offspring (3.57 +or - 0.37 and 4.81 + or - 0.43 x 10; p < 0.001) in comparison to control (2.28 + or - 0.31 x 10). The mutation frequencies from F1 offspring of low dose DU, Ta- or Ni-implanted fathers (2. 71 + or - 0.35, 2.38 + or - 0.35, and 2.93 + or - 0.39 x 10, respectively) were not significantly different than control levels (2.28 + or - 0.31 x 10). Offspring from Co (4 Gy) irradiated fathers did demonstrate an increased lacI mutation frequency (4.69 + or - 0.48 x 10) as had been shown previously. To evaluate the role of radiation involved in the observed DU effects, males were exposed to equal concentrations (50 mg U L) of either enriched uranium or DU in their drinking water for 2 mo prior to breeding. A comparison of these offspring indicated that there was a specific-activity dependent increase in offspring bone marrow mutation frequency. Taken together these uranyl nitrate data support earlier results in other model systems showing that radiation can play a role in DU-induced biological effects in vitro. However, since the lacI mutation model measures point mutations and cannot measure large deletions that are characteristic of radiation damage, the role of DU chemical effects in the observed offspring mutation frequency increase may also be significant. Regardless of the question of DU-radiation vs. DU-chemical effects, the data indicate that there exists a route for transgenerational transmission of factor(s) leading to genomic instability in F1 progeny from DU-exposed fathers.","['Miller, Alexandra C', 'Stewart, Michael', 'Rivas, Rafael']","['Miller AC', 'Stewart M', 'Rivas R']","['Scientific Research Department, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20889-5603, USA. millera@afrri.usuhs.mil']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Lac Repressors)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Lac Repressors/genetics', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced/*genetics/metabolism', 'Uranium/metabolism/*toxicity']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e3181cfe0dd [doi]', '00004032-201009000-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2010 Sep;99(3):371-9. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e3181cfe0dd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model describes the dynamics of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment as well as the dynamics of each of the three blood cell types (leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets). The model parameters are estimated from the results of other experiments. They include the steady-state numbers of hematopoietic stem cells and peripheral blood cell lines for an unexposed organism, amplification parameters for each blood cell line, parameters describing the proliferation and apoptosis, parameters of feedback functions regulating the steady-state numbers, and characteristics of radiosensitivity in respect to cell death and non-lethal cell damages. The dynamic model of hematopoiesis is applied to the data on a subcohort of the Techa River residents with hematological measurements (e.g., blood counts) performed in 1950-1956 (which totals to about 3,500 exposed individuals). Among well-described effects observed in these data are the slope values of the dose-effect curves describing the hematopoietic inhibition and the dose rate patterns of the fractions of cytopenic states (e.g., leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). The model has been further generalized by inclusion of the component describing the risk of late stochastic effects. The risks of the development of late effects (such as leukemia) in population groups with specific patterns of early reactions in hematopoiesis (such as leukopenia induced by ionizing radiation) are investigated using simulation studies and compared to data.","['Akushevich, Igor V', 'Veremeyeva, Galina A', 'Dimov, Georgy P', 'Ukraintseva, Svetlana V', 'Arbeev, Konstantin G', 'Akleyev, Alexander V', 'Yashin, Anatoly I']","['Akushevich IV', 'Veremeyeva GA', 'Dimov GP', 'Ukraintseva SV', 'Arbeev KG', 'Akleyev AV', 'Yashin AI']","['Center for Population Health and Aging, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708-0408, USA. igor.akushevich@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 AG028259/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG032319/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AG-028259/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AG-032319/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Platelets/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Erythrocytes/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/radiation effects', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutagenesis/radiation effects', 'Population Groups/statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Time Factors']",PMC3830533,['NIHMS523839'],2010/08/12 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e3181c61dc1 [doi]', '00004032-201009000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2010 Sep;99(3):322-9. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e3181c61dc1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While As(2)O(3) is remarkably cytotoxic in human ovarian cancer cells, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. We recently investigated the effects of As(2)O(3) on several transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling mediators to better understand its cell death mechanism. Indeed, dysregulated (TGFbeta) signaling is typical of ovarian cancers. Based on our findings, we propose that As(2)O(3) induces a Beclin 1-independent autophagic pathway in ovarian carcinoma cells by modulating SnoN/SkiL expression, implicating SnoN as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancers.","['Raffoul, Fadi', 'Campla, Christie', 'Nanjundan, Meera']","['Raffoul F', 'Campla C', 'Nanjundan M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA098258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123219/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20101016,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SKIL protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",PMC3359473,,2010/08/12 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['13041 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.6.7.13041 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2010 Oct;6(7):955-7. doi: 10.4161/auto.6.7.13041.

Here we show that genotoxic drugs that induce senescence, such as 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU), thymidine (TMD), distamycin A (DMA), aphidicolin (APH), etoposide (ET) and camptothecin (CPT) all evoke expansion of PML nuclear compartment and its association with persistent DNA lesions in several human cancer cell lines and normal diploid fibroblasts. This phenomenon was accompanied by elevation of PML transcripts after treatment with BrdU, TMD, DMA and CPT. Chemical inhibition of all JAK kinases and RNAi-mediated knock-down of JAK1 suppressed PML expression, implicating JAK/STAT-mediated signaling in regulation of the PML gene. As PML protein stability remained unchanged after drug treatment, decreased protein turnover was unlikely to explain the senescence-associated increased abundance of PML. Furthermore, binding activity of Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) within the PML gene promoter, and suppression of reporter gene activity after deletion of ISRE from the PML promoter region suggested that drug-induced PML transcription is controlled via transcription factors interacting with this element.

Nucleophosmin (NPM), a multifunctional protein, forms a stable protein complex with ARF in the nucleolus and protects ARF from the proteasome-mediated degradation. Notably, NPM is mutated in about one third of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and these mutations lead to aberrant cytoplasmic dislocation of nucleophosmin (NPM-c). Cytoplasmic NPM mutants lose their abilities to retain ARF in the nucleolus and fail to stabilize ARF. Thus, activation of the ARF-p53 axis is significantly compromised in these AML cells. We have recently identified the ubiquitin ligase of ARF (ULF) as a key factor that controls ARF turnover in human cells. Here, we found that the steady levels of both ARF and p53 are very low in human acute myeloid leukaemia OCI-AML3 cells expressing cytoplamsic dislocated nucleophosmin (NPM-c). As expected, ARF is very unstable and rapidly degraded by proteasome. Nevertheless, ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF and reactivates p53 responses in these AML cells. These results further demonstrate that ULF is a bona fide E3 ligase for ARF and also suggest that ULF is an important target for activating the ARF-p53 axis in human AML cells.","['Chen, Delin', 'Yoon, Jong-Bok', 'Gu, Wei']","['Chen D', 'Yoon JB', 'Gu W']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA080058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100811,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (TRIP12 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",PMC3040923,,2010/08/12 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['12355 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.15.12355 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Aug 1;9(15):2946-51. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.15.12355.

Unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiling data revealed 8 unique cluster groups within these high-risk ALL patients, 2 of which were associated with known chromosomal translocations (t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1) or MLL), and 6 of which lacked any previously known cytogenetic lesion. One unique cluster was characterized by high expression of distinct outlier genes AGAP1, CCNJ, CHST2/7, CLEC12A/B, and PTPRM; ERG DNA deletions; and 4-year relapse-free survival of 94.7% +/- 5.1%, compared with 63.5% +/- 3.7% for the cohort (P = .01).

CA-4 is one of the most potent antimitotic components of natural origin, but it is, however, intrinsically unstable. A novel series of CA-4 analogs incorporating a 3,4-diaryl-2-azetidinone (beta-lactam) ring were designed and synthesized with the objective to prevent cis -trans isomerization and improve the intrinsic stability without altering the biological activity of CA-4. Evaluation of selected beta-lactam CA-4 analogs demonstrated potent antitubulin, antiproliferative, and antimitotic effects in human leukemia cells. A lead beta-lactam analog, CA-432, displayed comparable antiproliferative activities with CA-4. CA-432 induced rapid apoptosis in HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cells, which was accompanied by depolymerization of the microtubular network, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, caspase-3 activation, and Bcl-2 cleavage. A prolonged G(2)M cell cycle arrest accompanied by a sustained phosphorylation of mitotic spindle checkpoint protein, BubR1, and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) preceded apoptotic events in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Molecular docking studies in conjunction with comprehensive cell line data rule out CA-4 and beta-lactam derivatives as P-glycoprotein substrates. Furthermore, both CA-4 and CA-432 induced significantly more apoptosis compared with imatinib mesylate in ex vivo samples from patients with CML, including those positive for the T315I mutation displaying resistance to imatinib mesylate and dasatinib. In summary, synthetic intrinsically stable analogs of CA-4 that display significant clinical potential as antileukemic agents have been designed and synthesized.","['Greene, Lisa M', 'Nathwani, Seema M', 'Bright, Sandra A', 'Fayne, Darren', 'Croke, Aisling', 'Gagliardi, Maria', 'McElligott, Anthony M', ""O'Connor, Lisa"", 'Carr, Miriam', 'Keely, Niall O', ""O'Boyle, Niamh M"", 'Carroll, Peig', 'Sarkadi, Balazs', 'Conneally, Eibhlin', 'Lloyd, David G', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Meegan, Mary J', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Greene LM', 'Nathwani SM', 'Bright SA', 'Fayne D', 'Croke A', 'Gagliardi M', 'McElligott AM', ""O'Connor L"", 'Carr M', 'Keely NO', ""O'Boyle NM"", 'Carroll P', 'Sarkadi B', 'Conneally E', 'Lloyd DG', 'Lawler M', 'Meegan MJ', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. greeneli@tcd.ie']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100810,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Azetidines)', '0 (CA 432)', '0 (CA-104)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (beta-Lactams)', '6JKA7MAH9C (Guaiacol)', 'I5590ES2QZ (fosbretabulin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azetidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Guaiacol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Structure', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Stilbenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'beta-Lactams/*chemistry']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.110.170415 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.110.170415 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2010 Nov;335(2):302-13. doi: 10.1124/jpet.110.170415.

We evaluated the role of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in determining the sensitivity of leukemia cells to PTL-induced apoptosis. In this study, the level of PTL-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis was significantly higher in the MPO-high leukemia cell lines compared with the MPO-low leukemia cell lines. Pretreatment of MPO-high leukemia cells with a MPO-specific inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, or a MPO-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the PTL-induced ROS generation and apoptosis, indicating that MPO plays a crucial role in PTL-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. PTL-induced apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and survivin and selectively observed in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing higher levels of MPO (>/=50%) while sparing both AML cells with lower MPO and normal CD34-positive (CD34+) normal bone marrow cells. The extent of PTL-induced apoptosis of the CD34+CD38- cell fraction was significantly greater in the MPO-high AML cases, compared with the MPO-low AML (P < 0.01) and normal CD34+ marrow cells (P < 0.01). Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient human leukemia mouse model also revealed that PTL preferentially targets the MPO-high AML cells. Our data suggest that MPO plays a crucial role in determining the susceptibility of leukemia cells to PTL-induced apoptosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe seven childhood cancer patients with clinical and radiological symptoms of PRES, and reviewed all well-documented PRES cases reported during childhood cancer treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-six children with PRES, including our 7 cases, were identified in the literature. Mean age at onset was 9 (range: 2-17) years. Primary diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 31), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 7) and solid tumors (n = 13). PRES patients presented with seizures (n = 50), altered mental status (n = 20), visual disturbances (n = 24) and/or headaches (n = 17). PRES was associated with hypertension in 49 patients. About 86% of the patients had both clinical and radiological reversible symptoms. Four patients developed epilepsy, in one patient ataxia remained and one patient had a persistent mydriasis. CONCLUSION: Although PRES has predominantly been described in leukemia patients, it occurs in children with solid tumors as well. Hypertension seems to be the most important trigger for the occurrence of PRES during childhood cancer treatment. Seizures are the most common accompanying sign. Symptoms and radiological findings normalize in approximately 90% of the cases, but in 10% neurological symptoms remain.","['de Laat, P', 'Te Winkel, M L', 'Devos, A S', 'Catsman-Berrevoets, C E', 'Pieters, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M']","['de Laat P', 'Te Winkel ML', 'Devos AS', 'Catsman-Berrevoets CE', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100810,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertensive Encephalopathy/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)38664-8 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdq382 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2011 Feb;22(2):472-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdq382.

PATIENTS/METHODS: Clinical and laboratory records of 109 patients with acquired PFDs diagnosed over 5 years were analyzed. Screening studies (platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time), template bleeding time, platelet factor 3 (PF-3) availability test, light-transmission aggregometry, and further testing as indicated were performed. RESULTS: 64 patients had mild and 26 had major bleeding. In all, 15 were referred for preoperative testing, whereas 4 had thrombotic events. Causes and associations of PFDs were drug-induced (34), idiopathic (34), hematopoietic neoplasms (15; myeloma 4, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia 2, chronic myeloid leukemia 4, essential thrombocythaemia 3, and primary myelofibrosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 1 each), chronic liver disease (4), postcardiac surgery (2), uremia (2), and thalassemia major (7). Miscellaneous disorders comprised the rest. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired PFDs span a wide range of disease settings. Systematic, sequential laboratory testing identifies patterns of dysfunction, excludes inherited disorders, and streamlines management.","['Sharma, Prashant', 'Kar, Rakhee', 'Bhargava, Rahul', 'Ranjan, Ravi', 'Pravas Chandra Mishra', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Sharma P', 'Kar R', 'Bhargava R', 'Ranjan R', 'Pravas Chandra Mishra', 'Saxena R']","['Haematology Department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100810,United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,,IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/blood/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Platelet Count', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Thrombin Time']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1076029610379397 [pii]', '10.1177/1076029610379397 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2011 Feb;17(1):88-93. doi: 10.1177/1076029610379397.

Therapeutic drug monitoring of 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations is however proposed in the following clinical situations: to check the observance, to try to explain therapeutic failure, to manage patients with limited thiopurine methyl transferase activity or patients treated with associated drugs that can modify thiopurine methyl transferase activity. The literature review shows that high concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and methylated metabolites are associated with an increased risk of bone marrow toxicity.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to minimize the heterogeneity of information derived from whole-genome expression analysis and to identify specific genetic differences between highly purified malignant and nonmalignant (control) T cells from the same patient with SS. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from a patient with SS, stained with anti-T-cell receptor Vb (TCR-Vb) antibodies, and sorted by multiparameter flow cytometry. Malignant cells expressed the dominant TCR-Vb; control T cells lacked the dominant TCR-Vb but were otherwise phenotypically identical (CD3+CD4+CD45RO+). These cell populations were compared using the Illumina Inc. Sentrix Human-6 expression BeadChip system. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis using the J5 test, which was selected for data analysis based on an efficiency analysis of competing statistical methods, showed differential expression of 44 genes between the malignant and nonmalignant cell subsets. Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger protein (ZBTB16) was the most profoundly upregulated gene in the malignant cell population, while interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon-induced protein 35 (IFI35), which are important elements of the cellular response to viral infection, were significantly downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the feasibility of this novel comparative approach to genomic profiling in SS. Using this method, we identified several differentially expressed genes and pathways not previously described in SS. While these findings require validation in larger studies, they may be important in SS pathogenesis.","['Pomerantz, R G', 'Mirvish, E D', 'Erdos, G', 'Falo, L D Jr', 'Geskin, L J']","['Pomerantz RG', 'Mirvish ED', 'Erdos G', 'Falo LD Jr', 'Geskin LJ']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Presby South Tower Suite 3880, 200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],['M01 RR000056/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Sezary Syndrome/*genetics/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology']",PMC2974048,['NIHMS226671'],2010/08/12 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJD9973 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.09973.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2010 Nov;163(5):1090-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.09973.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the mouse, live births of offspring using germ cells induced from ESCs in vitro have been reported. Furthermore, some efficient methods for inducing the useful number of germ cells from ESCs have also been developed. On the other hand, in primates, despite the appearances of germ cell-like cells including meiotic cells were observed by spontaneous differentiation or introducing transgenes, it has not been determined whether fully functional germ cells can be derived from ESCs. To elucidate the property for the germ cells induced from primate ESCs, specification of the promoting factors for the germ cell development and improving the efficiency of germ cell derivation are essential. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been reported as one of the important factors for mouse primordial germ cell (PGC) survival in vitro. However, the effects of LIF on germ cell formation from pluripotent cells of primates have not been examined. The aim of this study is to determine whether LIF addition can improve in vitro germ cell production from cynomolgus monkey ESCs (cyESCs). After 8 days of differentiation, LIF added culture induced dome-shaped germ cell colonies as indicated by the intense expression of alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP). These cells also demonstrate high-level expression of the germ cell-marker VASA, OCT-4, and BLIMP-1, and show SSEA-1 expression that supports their early stage germ cell identity. Finally, we observed that adding LIF to differentiating cultures inhibited meiotic gene expressions and increased the percentage of ALP-positive cells, and demonstrate that the addition of LIF to differentiation media increases differentiation of early germ cells from the cyESCs.","['Fukunaga, Naoto', 'Teramura, Takeshi', 'Onodera, Yuta', 'Takehara, Toshiyuki', 'Fukuda, Kanji', 'Hosoi, Yoshihiko']","['Fukunaga N', 'Teramura T', 'Onodera Y', 'Takehara T', 'Fukuda K', 'Hosoi Y']","['Department of Biology Oriented Science and Technology, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Reprogram,Cellular reprogramming,101528176,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Germ Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cell.2009.0097 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Reprogram. 2010 Aug;12(4):369-76. doi: 10.1089/cell.2009.0097.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed the undifferentiated propagation of human ES cell lines (hESCs, H1, and HSF6) and mouse ES cell lines (mESCs, D3, and CE3), which were previously maintained on an MEF feeder, using human placenta-derived fibroblast-like cell (HPC) feeders originated from chorionic villi of women who had undergone therapeutic abortion due to known maternal disease that is aggravated by pregnancy. Moreover, we tried to introduce the HPC feeder for the establishment of inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human placental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). On the HPC feeder we were able to propagate ESCs and iPSCs colonies as an undifferentiated state up to the 50th passage and 20th passage, respectively. Maintenance of undifferentiated ESCs was identified by the expression of ALP, SSEA-1, SSEA-4, TRA-81, TRA-60, Oct-4, Nanog, or Rex-1. Also, addition of leukemia inhibitory factor was not required for undifferentiated propagation of mESCs on the HPC feeder. The efficiency and expression of three germ layer markers of embryoid bodies (EBs) from ESCs were satisfactory in both the MEF and HPC group. EBs formed from iPSCs were scant, and differentiation to the three germ layers was identifiable by reverst transcription-polymerase chain reactio (RT-PCR) only in the HPC group.

The dependence of excess relative risk on exposure dose is well described by a linear model.

Although it was reported as rare to happen, it is a well-known devastating malignancy with little treatment effects. As a result, most of the patients suffer from poor prognosis. On the other hand, the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arises worldwide. Radical surgical resection was regarded as the most effective treatment, in spite of recurrence. Unfortunately, only 30 percent of patients qualify for this at the time of diagnosis. Hence, for advanced cholangiocarcinoma, chemotherapy is the only modality left to be chosen. Recently LaRocca and Kudoh reported about effective chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma. Even so, because of no randomized study, no standard chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma has been accepted, and most of the projects were based on 5-Fu. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, which can competitively inhibit RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, human vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR2, VEGFR3) platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR), Flt3, and C-kit receptors, has been successfully applied for solid tumors such as renal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib used alone or in combinations, can induce growth-inhibition and apoptosis in vitro experiments. Application of sorafenib alone for cholangiocarcinoma has also been published. The role of combination with other chemotherapy drugs in advanced cholangiocarcinoma still needs to be defined. METHODOLOGY: A patient admitted for exploratory operation was demonstrated to be suffering from unresectable, biopsy-proven intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A pump was placed inside hepatic artery, for the purpose of infusion chemotherapy. Program of chemotherapy was scheduled and hepatic arterial infusion of 5-Fu/LV +oxaliplatin +hydroxycamptothecine was performed. Three months later, no effect was discovered, so sorafenib was suggested to combine with infusion chemotherapy. For the first time we applied sorafenib combination to hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy RESULT: After lower dosage of sorafenib was used as a combination with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, size of hepatic lesions and level CA19-9 of peripheral blood count were decreased, without any damage to the hepatic function, except for temporary skin hyperkeratosis as well as vomit. Efficacy of treatment was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scan. CONCLUSION: So far as in our patient, the application of sorafenib combination with other agents through hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy may be an effective way for cholangiocarcinoma, but the definite mechanism has to be confirmed by methods of molecular biology.","['Qun, Wang', 'Tao, Yin']","['Qun W', 'Tao Y']","['Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Hu bei Cancer Hospital No.116, South Zuo dao quan Road, Wuhan 430079, Hubei Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Hepatogastroenterology,Hepato-gastroenterology,8007849,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (CA-19-9 Antigen)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Benzenesulfonates/*administration & dosage', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'CA-19-9 Antigen/blood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Sorafenib']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hepatogastroenterology. 2010 May-Jun;57(99-100):426-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some studies have revealed that Fas (CD95/APO1) which mediates apoptotic signal and decrease of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M4/M5 leukemic cells. The aim of the study was to compare cytomorphology and cytochemistry of bone marrow (BM) apoptotic leukemic cells to preserved peripheral blood (PB) leukemic cells in our patient, a 76-year-old man with AML-M5b treated at Zagreb University Hospital Center. BM and PB of the AL patient were analyzed after Pappenheim and cytochemical stainings, and leukemic cells were classified according to FAB and WHO classification. Analysis of PB revealed leukocytosis and 80-90% monocytic cells (46% monoblasts, 29% promonocytes and 11% monocytes). Only a few preserved monoblasts and promonocytes were found in BM, together with numerous morphologically altered cells with characteristic chromatin condensation and pyknosis of nucleus, as well as nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Thus, cytomorphology of PB leukemic cells pointed to proliferation of immature monocytic cells, and cytomorphology of BM to cell apoptosis. Cytochemistry of PB monocytic cells and BM apoptotic cells confirmed monocytic cell lineage because esterase was strongly positive in almost all BM apoptotic leukemic cells and PB leukemic cells, and esterase was completely inhibited with sodium fluoride. On the basis of these findings, AML-M5b was diagnosed in our patient. There are many possible explanations for our observation of BM leukemic cell apoptosis in a patient with AML-M5. The most reliable one is that apoptosis was induced ex vivo after BM aspiration in course of the air drying of BM specimen before staining. Mass BM leukemic cell apoptosis that was recorded in contrast to numerous preserved leukemic cells in PK could be probably connected to unfavorable ratio of relatively low concentration of cytokines in relation to high leukemic cell number in BM aspirated cytologic specimen.","['Vrbanus, Ljiljana', 'Sucic, Mirna', 'Markovic-Glamocak, Mirjana', 'Ries, Suncica', 'Gjadrov-Kuvezdic, Koraljka', 'Fabijanic, Iris', 'Antulov, Jasenka', 'Petrik, Jozsef', 'Labar, Boris']","['Vrbanus L', 'Sucic M', 'Markovic-Glamocak M', 'Ries S', 'Gjadrov-Kuvezdic K', 'Fabijanic I', 'Antulov J', 'Petrik J', 'Labar B']","['Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology, Zagreb University Hospital Center and School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Coll Antropol,Collegium antropologicum,8003354,['0 (fas Receptor)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",,,2010/08/12 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/08/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Coll Antropol. 2010 Jun;34(2):705-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was submitted to two cycles of chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, and intrathecal chemotherapy, but he died after 10 months because of disease complications (lung aspergillosis and pleural effusion). Our case report showed how morphology alone can be misleading and sometimes is not enough in diagnosing ALL.

A total of 71895 cells were analyzed on SFORM PC (VAMSTEC, Zagreb). Correlation between morphometric, AgNOR and ICM characteristics revealed the cells with low proliferative activity to possess small, homogeneous AgNOR, with the majority of cells in the peak of DNA histogram. The cells with high proliferative activity had inhomogeneous AgNOR, mostly containing greater DNA content than peak cells, pathologic mitoses (DNA > 4N), or the majority of cells were in the S-phase of the cell cycle. Cells with medium proliferative activity and annular AgNOR were in-between. Analysis of different tumor mass compartments showed that lymphatic cells with the affinity to accumulate in BM regularly exhibited low proliferative activity (a lower percentage of cells in SFC and highest percentage of cells in the peak of the G0/G1 phase). The cells in LN exhibited the characteristics of proliferative cells (an increased number of AgNOR, larger and more proliferative inhomogeneous AgNOR, and lowest percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase). The migration of cells from BM to LN and between lymph nodes occurred through PB (there were cells with low and high proliferative activity: a higher proportion of cells in SFC and at the same time in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle). Analysis of cell size and proliferative activity in different compartments of tumor mass revealed that the cells in BM and PB did not differ substantially according to size and proliferative activity, while an inverse pattern was observed between PB and LN. As small cells are inactive and larger cells more proliferative, the analysis quite unexpectedly showed the PB cells to be largest and most inactive, in contrast to LN where the cells were smallest and most active.

We have investigated the relation between delayed luminescence (DL) induced by UV-laser excitation and the effects of MD, hydrogen peroxide, and QC on apoptosis and cell cycle in human leukemia Jurkat T-cells. Treatments with 500 muM H(2)O(2) and 250 muM MD for 20 min produced 66.0 +/- 4.9 and 46.4 +/- 8.6% apoptotic cell fractions, respectively. Long-term (24 h) pre-exposure to 5 muM, but not 0.5 muM QC enhanced apoptosis induced by MD, whereas short-term (1 h) pre-incubation with 10 muM QC offered 50% protection against H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis, but potentiated apoptosis induced by MD.

Immunotherapy offers an alternative of great interest in this context but defect or abnormal expression of human leukocyte antigens (HLA), frequently observed in cancer cells, limits its efficiency. Natural killer (NK) cells, which are able to kill target cells in a HLA-independent way, represent a novel tool in the treatment of haematological malignancies. Abnormal NK cytolytic function is observed in all the haematological malignancies studied, such as acute leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myeloid/lymphoid leukaemia. Several mechanisms are involved in the alterations of NK cytotoxicity: decreased expression of activating receptors, increased expression of inhibitory receptors or defective expression of NK ligands on target cells. Further studies are needed to identify how each type of haematological malignancy escapes from the innate immune response. Attempts to increase the expression of activating receptors, to counteract inhibitory receptors expression, or to increase NK cell cytotoxic capacities could overcome tumour escape from innate immunity. These therapies are based on monoclonal antibodies or culture of NK cells in presence of cytokines or dendritic cells. Moreover, many novel drugs used in haematological malignancies [tyrosine kinase inhibitors, IMIDs((R)), proteasome inhibitors, demethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), histamine dihydrochloride] display interesting immunomodulatory properties that affect NK cells. These data suggest that combined modalities associating cytotoxic drugs with innate immunity modulators may represent a major breakthrough in tumour eradication.","['Sanchez, C J', 'Le Treut, T', 'Boehrer, A', 'Knoblauch, B', 'Imbert, J', 'Olive, D', 'Costello, R T']","['Sanchez CJ', 'Le Treut T', 'Boehrer A', 'Knoblauch B', 'Imbert J', 'Olive D', 'Costello RT']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie et de Biologie Moleculaire, Hopital Nord, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100810,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Immunomodulation', '*Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Escape/immunology']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0898-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Jan;60(1):1-13. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0898-x.

The dramatic apoptosis was observed in GC-sensitive CEM-C7 cells after incubated with DEX for 48 h, while not in GC-resistant CEM-C1 cells. The significant up-regulation of BIM in CEM-C7 cells induced by DEX was also observed, but no up-regulation of BIM was detected in DEX-induced CEM-C1 cells. When treated with DEX plus RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor blocker, the apoptosis and BIM expression of CEM-C7 cells were canceled. P38MAPK-blocking pharmacon SB203580 also significantly inhibited the up-regulation of BIM in CEM-C7 cells. These suggested that the absence of BIM up-regulation is one of the important mechanisms of GC resistance, GC-GR conjugation is indispensible in both GC-induced apoptosis and up-regulation of BIM, and p38 MAPK signal pathway is also involved in this process.","['Zhao, Ya-ning', 'Guo, Xia', 'Ma, Zhi-gui', 'Gu, Ling', 'Ge, Jiao', 'Li, Qiang']","['Zhao YN', 'Guo X', 'Ma ZG', 'Gu L', 'Ge J', 'Li Q']","['Department of Phymatology, Baoji Municipal Central Hospital, 721008, Shaanxi, Baoji, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100810,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9641-x [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28(4):1609-17. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9641-x.

One basic requirement is to reliably and accurately know the distribution and number of biological cells being dispensed. In this study, a novel optical counting technique to efficiently quantify the number of cells flowing into a microtube is presented. REH, B-lymphoid precursor leukemia, are stained with a fluorescent dye and frames of moving cells are recorded using a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The basic principle is to calculate the total fluorescence intensity of the image and to divide it by the average intensity of a single cell. This method allows counting the number of cells with an uncertainty +/-5%, which compares favorably to the standard biological methodology, based on the manual Trypan Blue assay, which is destructive to the cells and presents an uncertainty in the order of 20%. The use of a microdevice for vertical hydrodynamic focusing, which can reduce the background noise of out of focus cells by concentrating the cells in a thin layer, has further improved the technique. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and confocal laser scanning microscopy images have shown an 82% reduction in the vertical displacement of the cells. For the flow rates imposed during this study, a throughput of 100-200 cellss is achieved.","['Chiavaroli, Stefano', 'Newport, David', 'Woulfe, Bernie']","['Chiavaroli S', 'Newport D', 'Woulfe B']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100615,United States,Biomicrofluidics,Biomicrofluidics,101293825,,,,PMC2917866,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/08/11 06:01,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1063/1.3380598 [doi]'],epublish,Biomicrofluidics. 2010 Jun 15;4(2). doi: 10.1063/1.3380598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Double UCBT (DUCBT) has been used to circumvent the issue of low cell dose, but acute GVHD remains a significant problem. We describe our experience in 32 subjects, who underwent DUCBT after reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine/melphalan/antithymocyte globulin and who received sirolimus and tacrolimus to prevent acute GVHD. Engraftment of neutrophils occurred in all patients at a median of 21 days, and platelet engraftment occurred at a median of 42 days. Three subjects had grade II-IV acute GVHD (9.4%) and chronic GVHD occurred in four subjects (cumulative incidence 12.5%). No deaths were caused by GVHD and NRM at 100 days was 12.5%. At 2 years, NRM, PFS and OS were 34.4, 31.2 and 53.1%, respectively. As expected, immunologic reconstitution was slow, but PFS and OS were associated with reconstitution of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte subsets, suggesting that recovery of adaptive immunity is required for the prevention of infection and relapse after transplantation. In summary, sirolimus and tacrolimus provide excellent GVHD prophylaxis in DUCBT, and this regimen is associated with low NRM after DUCBT.","['Cutler, C', 'Stevenson, K', 'Kim, H T', 'Brown, J', 'McDonough, S', 'Herrera, M', 'Reynolds, C', 'Liney, D', 'Kao, G', 'Ho, V', 'Armand, P', 'Koreth, J', 'Alyea, E', 'Dey, B R', 'Attar, E', 'Spitzer, T', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Ritz, J', 'Soiffer, R', 'Antin, J H', 'Ballen, K']","['Cutler C', 'Stevenson K', 'Kim HT', 'Brown J', 'McDonough S', 'Herrera M', 'Reynolds C', 'Liney D', 'Kao G', 'Ho V', 'Armand P', 'Koreth J', 'Alyea E', 'Dey BR', 'Attar E', 'Spitzer T', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Ritz J', 'Soiffer R', 'Antin JH', 'Ballen K']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. corey_cutler@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA123855/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123855/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100809,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Sirolimus/*therapeutic use', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",PMC3012740,['NIHMS235459'],2010/08/11 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2010192 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2010.192 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 May;46(5):659-67. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2010.192.

A total of 23 patients with relapsed/refractory AML were prospectively scheduled for HDM with or without stem cell support followed by myeloablative allogeneic HSCT.

A total of 18 patients (78%) achieved a leukemia-free state and an additional four had substantial reduction of the initial leukemia burden warranting treatment continuation. There were no differences between patients with or without immediate stem cell support regarding mucositis or other organ toxicity. A total of 20 patients proceeded to myeloablative allogeneic HSCT. Outcome of allogeneic HSCT was poor: 11 patients (55%) relapsed, 7 patients (35%) died from TRM and only 2 patients (10%) were alive at the last follow-up.

We used an integrated proteomic approach that includes label-free quantitative protein complex and phosphorylation profiling by mass spectrometry to systematically characterize the proximal signaling network of this oncogenic kinase. The proximal BCR-ABL1 signaling network shows a modular and layered organization with an inner core of three leukemia transformation-relevant adaptor protein complexes (Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 complex, CrkI complex and Dok1/Dok2 complex). We introduced an 'interaction directionality' analysis, which annotates static protein networks with information on the directionality of phosphorylation-dependent interactions. In this analysis, the observed network structure was consistent with a step-wise phosphorylation-dependent assembly of the Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 and the Dok1/Dok2 complexes on the BCR-ABL1 core. The CrkI complex demonstrated a different directionality, which supports a candidate assembly on the Nedd9 (Hef1, CasL) scaffold. As adaptor protein family members can compensate for each other in leukemic transformation, we compared members of the Dok and Crk protein families and found both overlapping and differential binding patterns. We identified an additional level of regulation for the CrkII protein via binding to 14-3-3 proteins, which was independent from its inhibitory phosphorylation. We also identified novel components of the inner core complexes, including the kinases Pragmin (Sgk223) and Lrrk1 (Lrrk2 paralog). Pragmin was found as a component of the CrkI complex and is a potential link between BCR-ABL1/CrkI and RhoA signaling. Lrrk1 is an unusual kinase with a GTPase domain. We detected Lrrk1 as a component of the Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 complex and found that it functionally interacts with the regulator of small GTPases Arap1 (Centd2) and possibly participates in the mitogen-activated protein kinase response to cellular stresses. This modular and phosphorylation-driven interaction network provides a framework for the integration of pleiotropic signaling effects of BCR-ABL1 toward leukemic transformation.","['Titz, B', 'Low, T', 'Komisopoulou, E', 'Chen, S S', 'Rubbi, L', 'Graeber, T G']","['Titz B', 'Low T', 'Komisopoulou E', 'Chen SS', 'Rubbi L', 'Graeber TG']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-7227, USA.']",['eng'],"['K22 HG002807/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG002807/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100809,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Phosphoproteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC5308218,['NIHMS843370'],2010/08/11 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010331 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.331 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Nov 4;29(44):5895-910. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.331.

As incidence of many solid tumours is much lower in DS, we speculated that disturbed early haematopoietic differentiation could be the cause of increased leukaemia risk. If a common mechanism is behind the risk of both major leukaemia types, it would have to arise before the bifurcation to myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Using the transchromosomic system (mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)) bearing an extra human chromosome 21 (HSA21)) we analyzed the early stages of haematopoietic commitment (mesodermal colony formation) in vitro. We observed that trisomy 21 (T21) causes increased production of haemogenic endothelial cells, haematopoietic stem cell precursors and increased colony forming potential, with significantly increased immature progenitors. Transchromosomic colonies showed increased expression of Gata-2, c-Kit and Tie-2. A panel of partial T21 ESCs allowed us to assign these effects to HSA21 sub-regions, mapped by 3.5 kbp-resolution tiling arrays. The Gata-2 increase on one side, and c-Kit and Tie-2 increases on the other, could be attributed to two different, non-overlapping HSA21 regions. Using human-specific small interfering RNA silencing, we could demonstrate that an extra copy of RUNX1, but not ETS-2 or ERG, causes an increase in Tie-2/c-Kit levels. Finally, we detected significantly increased levels of RUNX1, C-KIT and PU.1 in human foetal livers with T21. We conclude that overdose of more than one HSA21 gene contributes to the disturbance of early haematopoiesis in DS, and that one of the contributors is RUNX1. As the observed T21-driven hyperproduction of multipotential immature precursors precedes the bifurcation to lymphoid and myeloid lineages, we speculate that this could create conditions of increased chance for acquisition of pre-leukaemogenic rearrangements/mutations in both lymphoid and myeloid lineages during foetal haematopoiesis, contributing to the increased risk of both leukaemia types in DS.","['De Vita, S', 'Canzonetta, C', 'Mulligan, C', 'Delom, F', 'Groet, J', 'Baldo, C', 'Vanes, L', 'Dagna-Bricarelli, F', 'Hoischen, A', 'Veltman, J', 'Fisher, E M C', 'Tybulewicz, V L J', 'Nizetic, D']","['De Vita S', 'Canzonetta C', 'Mulligan C', 'Delom F', 'Groet J', 'Baldo C', 'Vanes L', 'Dagna-Bricarelli F', 'Hoischen A', 'Veltman J', 'Fisher EM', 'Tybulewicz VL', 'Nizetic D']","['Queen Mary University of London, Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Centre for Paediatrics, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0601056/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'GTB07001/TI_/Telethon/Italy', 'MC_U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100809,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/physiology', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics']",PMC3007620,,2010/08/11 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010351 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.351 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Nov 18;29(46):6102-14. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.351.

We set out to define the impact of TP53 mutations in CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed TP53 mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (exons 2 to 11) in a randomized prospective trial (n = 375) with a follow-up of 52.8 months (German CLL Study Group CLL4 trial; fludarabine [F] v F + cyclophosphamide [FC]). RESULTS: We found TP53 mutations in 8.5% of patients (28 of 328 patients). None of the patients with TP53 mutation showed a complete response. In patients with TP53 mutation, compared with patients without TP53 mutation, median progression-free survival (PFS; 23.3 v 62.2 months, respectively) and overall survival (OS; 29.2 v 84.6 months, respectively) were significantly decreased (both P < .001). TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p deletions were found in 4.5% of patients. PFS and OS for patients with 17p deletion and patients with TP53 mutation in the absence of 17p deletion were similar. Multivariate analysis identified TP53 mutation as the strongest prognostic marker regarding PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.8; P < .001) and OS (HR = 7.2; P < .001). Other independent predictors of OS were IGHV mutation status (HR = 1.9), 11q deletion (HR = 1.9), 17p deletion (HR = 2.3), and FC treatment arm (HR = 0.6). CONCLUSION: CLL with TP53 mutation carries a poor prognosis regardless of the presence of 17p deletion when treated with F-based chemotherapy. Thus, TP53 mutation analysis should be incorporated into the evaluation of patients with CLL before treatment initiation. Patients with TP53 mutation should be considered for alternative treatment approaches.","['Zenz, Thorsten', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Busch, Raymonde', 'Denzel, Tina', 'Habe, Sonja', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Edelmann, Jennifer', 'Bergmann, Manuela', 'Hopfinger, Georg', 'Hensel, Manfred', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Zenz T', 'Eichhorst B', 'Busch R', 'Denzel T', 'Habe S', 'Winkler D', 'Buhler A', 'Edelmann J', 'Bergmann M', 'Hopfinger G', 'Hensel M', 'Hallek M', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100809,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.27.8762 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.27.8762 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Oct 10;28(29):4473-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.8762.

In contrast to childhood leukemia, no pooled analyses of childhood brain tumors and exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) have been conducted. The authors carried out a pooled analysis based on primary data (1960-2001) from 10 studies of ELF-MF exposure and childhood brain tumors to assess whether the combined results, adjusted for potential confounding, indicated an association. The odds ratios for childhood brain tumors in ELF-MF exposure categories of 0.1-<0.2 muT, 0.2-<0.4 muT, and >/=0.4 muT were 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.41), 0.70 (95% CI: 0.40, 1.22), and 1.14 (95% CI: 0.61, 2.13), respectively, in comparison with exposure of <0.1 muT. Other analyses employing alternate cutpoints, further adjustment for confounders, exclusion of particular studies, stratification by type of measurement or type of residence, and a nonparametric estimate of the exposure-response relation did not reveal consistent evidence of increased childhood brain tumor risk associated with ELF-MF exposure. These results provide little evidence for an association between ELF-MF exposure and childhood brain tumors.","['Kheifets, Leeka', 'Ahlbom, A', 'Crespi, C M', 'Feychting, M', 'Johansen, C', 'Monroe, J', 'Murphy, M F G', 'Oksuzyan, S', 'Preston-Martin, S', 'Roman, E', 'Saito, T', 'Savitz, D', 'Schuz, J', 'Simpson, J', 'Swanson, J', 'Tynes, T', 'Verkasalo, P', 'Mezei, G']","['Kheifets L', 'Ahlbom A', 'Crespi CM', 'Feychting M', 'Johansen C', 'Monroe J', 'Murphy MF', 'Oksuzyan S', 'Preston-Martin S', 'Roman E', 'Saito T', 'Savitz D', 'Schuz J', 'Simpson J', 'Swanson J', 'Tynes T', 'Verkasalo P', 'Mezei G']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1772, USA. kheifets@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016042-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100809,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",PMC2984256,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/10/13 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['kwq181 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwq181 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2010 Oct 1;172(7):752-61. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwq181.

There is no specific registry of childhood cancer in Castilla y Leon. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to estimate the childhood cancer incidence in the autonomous region of Castilla y Leon and to assess the usefulness of the computerised diagnosis of hospital discharges as a source of data in a potential autonomous region population based registry. METHODS: We included patients younger than 15 years old who were diagnosed, for the first time, of cancer during the years 2003-2007. The information collected was obtained through the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) of the public hospitals in the autonomous region of Castilla y Leon. RESULTS: In this period of 5 years (2003-2007), 220 cases of childhood cancer had been reported. The most frequent cancer detected was leukaemia (28.6%) followed by the central nervous system tumours (19.5%) and lymphoma (15.9%). The overall rate of childhood cancer incidence was 152.8 cases per million children. The diagnostics codes did not allow tumours to be classified by their histological type in 74 cases (33.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence by diagnostic groups of childhood cancer in the autonomous region of Castilla y Leon was similar to those reported by other national and international registries. In a Cancer registry the MBDS could be useful as a data source in the capture of new cases, but in a high percentage of cases it does not allow tumours to be classified by their histological type.","['Gonzalez Garcia, H', 'Quiros, A Blanco', 'Crespo, C Valbuena', 'Melendez, P Gutierrez', 'Gomez, S Tamames', 'Sanz, J Castrodeza']","['Gonzalez Garcia H', 'Quiros AB', 'Crespo CV', 'Melendez PG', 'Gomez ST', 'Sanz JC']","['Grupo Central del Registro de Tumores Infantiles, Valladolid, Castilla y Leon, Espana. hermeneg@gmail.com']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20100808,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Patient Discharge/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2011/02/02 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(10)00320-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2010.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2010 Oct;73(4):169-79. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2010.07.003.

The first risk factor for LM development is the histotype, with the highest incidence for highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) such as Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (LBL/ALL) and the lowest for indolent NHL. LM prophylaxis in aggressive NHL (other than BL and LBL/ALL) is a much debated question, because the identification of specific risk factors remains controversial. Moreover, there is not a consensus if the LM prophylaxis should consist of systemic chemotherapy (CT), intrathecal (i.t.) CT or both. In case of LM, the i.t. CT has a key role, but there is not a consensus on treatment schedule. Newer intensified regimens and rituximab lead to reconsider the whole approach to LM.","['Canova, Fabio', 'Marino, Dario', 'Trentin, Chiara', 'Solda, Caterina', 'Ghiotto, Cristina', 'Aversa, Savina Maria Luciana']","['Canova F', 'Marino D', 'Trentin C', 'Solda C', 'Ghiotto C', 'Aversa SM']","['Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV - IRCCS, Padova, Italy. canova1980@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100808,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/secondary', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Injections, Spinal/*methods', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2009/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(10)00172-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2011 Aug;79(2):127-34. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.07.005.

In vitro experiments with different cellular cultures (TE671, CHO and HEK293) using unmodified nanoparticles containing rhodamine have shown that particles were present on their surface within 48 h of incubation. In vitro tests using anti-CD8 conjugated nanoparticles in CHO cell cultures indicated that all transfected cells which express CD8 show these particles on their surface within 1h of incubation. These results demonstrated that, in a shorter time, the produced particles can target cells expressing CD8 on their surface which offers the ability to reduce drug side effects.

Among them, a few cell lines have been reported to be positive for CD36. We tried to establish a continuous erythroid cell line from the primary CD36(+) erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) by the lentivirus-mediated gene transduction system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lentiviral vector carrying SV40T, hTERT, or the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 (E6/E7) viral oncogenes, was introduced into CD36(+) EPCs, singularly or combined. Transformed cells were characterized in terms of histology, phenotype, karyotype, and gene expression profile. RESULTS: The lentiviral vector carrying HPV16 E6/E7 genes successfully transformed CD36(+) EPCs, creating a continuous cell line, CD36E. Immunophenotype analysis revealed that the CD36E cells had characteristics of erythroid progenitors, among which about 27% of the cell population produced hemoglobin. Colony-forming cell assay demonstrated that the CD36E cells were capable of forming erythroid colonies. Using cytokines or chemical agents, attempts were made to induce differentiation of the CD36E cells but were ineffective, indicating the irreversible erythroid lineage commitment of the cells. The gene expression profile of the CD36E cells displayed a marked difference from that of the CD36(+) EPCs. CONCLUSIONS: The continuous CD36E cell line is an erythroid progenitor cell line possessing the ability to produce hemoglobin. The CD36E cell line would be an excellent tool for applied research involving erythroid lineage cells and comparative studies with primary CD36(+) EPCs.","['Wong, Susan', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Wan, Zhihong', 'Kajigaya, Sachiko', 'Young, Neal S', 'Zhi, Ning']","['Wong S', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Wan Z', 'Kajigaya S', 'Young NS', 'Zhi N']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Z99 HL999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100807,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Papillomavirus E7 Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (oncogene protein E7, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['CD36 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Papillomavirus E7 Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectral Karyotyping', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology']",PMC6341492,['NIHMS994265'],2010/08/11 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00355-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Nov;38(11):994-1005.e1-2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.012.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) binds to plasma membrane receptors DR4 and DR5 and induces apoptosis via caspase-8 and -10. Here we have explored the interaction between APO866 and TRAIL in leukemia cell lines and in primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were treated with APO866, TRAIL, or their combination. Viability and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) were determined by cell staining with propidium iodide and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, respectively, and flow cytometry. Nampt and gamma-tubulin levels, as well as caspase-3 cleavage were detected by immunoblotting. DR4 and DR5 expression were assessed by immunostaining and flow cytometry. Caspases were inhibited with zVAD-FMK and zDEVD-FMK; autophagy with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, and wortmannin. Intracellular NAD(+) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured by cycling assays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. RESULTS: APO866 induced NAD(+) depletion, DeltaPsi(m) dissipation, and ATP shortage in leukemia cells, thereby leading to autophagic cell death. TRAIL induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. TRAIL addition to APO866 synergistically increased its activity in leukemia cells by enhancing NAD(+) depletion, DeltaPsi(m) dissipation, and ATP shortage. No DR5 upregulation at the cell surface in response to APO866 was observed. Remarkably, in healthy leukocytes APO866 and TRAIL were poorly active and failed to show any cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the extrinsic apoptotic cascade with TRAIL selectively amplifies the sequelae of Nampt inhibition in leukemia cells, and appears as a promising strategy to enhance APO866 activity in hematological malignancies.","['Zoppoli, Gabriele', 'Cea, Michele', 'Soncini, Debora', 'Fruscione, Floriana', 'Rudner, Justine', 'Moran, Eva', 'Caffa, Irene', 'Bedognetti, Davide', 'Motta, Giulia', 'Ghio, Riccardo', 'Ferrando, Fabio', 'Ballestrero, Alberto', 'Parodi, Silvio', 'Belka, Claus', 'Patrone, Franco', 'Bruzzone, Santina', 'Nencioni, Alessio']","['Zoppoli G', 'Cea M', 'Soncini D', 'Fruscione F', 'Rudner J', 'Moran E', 'Caffa I', 'Bedognetti D', 'Motta G', 'Ghio R', 'Ferrando F', 'Ballestrero A', 'Parodi S', 'Belka C', 'Patrone F', 'Bruzzone S', 'Nencioni A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100807,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00356-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Nov;38(11):979-88. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.013.

It has been characterized in acute myeloid leukemia as a fusion partner during chromosomal translocation. In this study, we identified a zebrafish nup98 gene and examined its role in embryonic development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two expressed sequence tags with translated sequences homologous to human NUP98 were identified. The gene was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from complementary DNA of zebrafish embryos. Cellular functions of zebrafish NUP98 were investigated in HeLa cells. nup98 expression and developmental functions in zebrafish embryos were investigated by whole-mount in situ hybridization and morpholino knockdown. RESULTS: Protein sequence of zebrafish nup98 shared 65% identity with its human homolog. Ectopic expression of zebrafish nup98 rescued the defective messenger RNA export due to human NUP98 knockdown in HeLa cells. In zebrafish embryos, nup98 was expressed diffusely in eyes and the developing brain since 18 hours postfertilization. Knockdown of nup98 with morpholino upregulated pu.1 expression by 39% +/- 15% (p = 0.0153) and scl expression by 36% +/- 7.6% (p = 0.0017). Expression of genes associated with erythropoiesis was unchanged. The morphants also developed intracranial hemorrhage at 48 hours postfertilization due to defective blood vessel development. CONCLUSIONS: A novel zebrafish nup98 was identified and it serves a role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking similar to human NUP98. During development, it modulates hematopoietic stem cell and early myeloid development and maintains the integrity of cranial vasculature in the developing central nervous system.","['Fung, Tsz-Kan', 'Chung, Martin I S', 'Liang, Raymond', 'Leung, Anskar Y H']","['Fung TK', 'Chung MI', 'Liang R', 'Leung AY']","['Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100807,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/embryology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00353-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Nov;38(11):1014-1021.e1-2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.010.

Spurred by recent studies that demonstrated that two commonly used antibodies against the erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors can in fact bind to completely unrelated and more broadly expressed proteins, we screened 27 commercially available monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies with claimed specificity to HuG-CSFR to determine if they are specific to this receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibodies were evaluated by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry using 293T cells engineered to overexpress HuG-CSFR protein, immortalized human hematopoietic cell lines expressing endogenous G-CSFR, and purified human neutrophils. RESULTS: Only two monoclonal antibodies and one polyclonal antibody could be employed using defined Western blotting or flow cytometry protocols to detect G-CSFR protein in cell lysates or on the surface of cells that express G-CSFR messenger RNA with no binding to cells that did not express the gene. None of the antibodies were suitable for immunohistochemistry. Competitive inhibition with soluble G-CSFR extracellular domain and small inhibitory RNA-mediated knock-down of G-CSFR messenger RNA further demonstrated the limited specificity of these antibodies for HuG-CSFR expressed on the cell surface. CONCLUSIONS: Most commercially available anti-HuG-CSFR antibodies do not bind specifically to this protein. These studies highlight the need for investigators to validate antibodies in their own systems to avoid the inadvertent use of nonspecifically binding antibodies that could lead, as exemplified in this case with a hematopoietic growth factor receptor, to erroneous conclusions about protein expression.","['deBruin, Cortney', 'Lincoln, Patrice', 'Hartley, Cynthia', 'Shehabeldin, Amro', 'Van, Gwyneth', 'Szilvassy, Stephen J']","['deBruin C', 'Lincoln P', 'Hartley C', 'Shehabeldin A', 'Van G', 'Szilvassy SJ']","['Hematology/Oncology Research Therapeutic Area, and Department of Protein Sciences, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA 91320, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100807,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00354-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Nov;38(11):1022-35. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.011.

Several pathways have been identified that promote maintenance of the cell. The principal mechanism for the extended survival is through induction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl-2 was the founding member of this family with five additional members, Bcl-X(L), Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1, discovered mostly in hematological malignancies. Another mechanism that could add to cell survival is the Pim kinase pathway. This family of enzymes is associated with Myc-driven transcription, cell cycle regulation, degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and protein translation. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia serves as an optimal model to understand the mechanism by which these two protein families provide survival advantage to cells. In addition, since this malignancy is known to be maintained by microenvironment milieu, this further adds advantage to investigate mechanisms by which these pro-survival proteins are induced in the presence of stromal support. Multiple mechanisms exists that result in increase in transcript and protein level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Following these inductions, post-translational modifications occur resulting in increased stability of pro-survival proteins, while Pim-mediated phosphorylation inhibits pro-apoptotic protein activity. Furthermore, there is a cross-talk between these two (Bcl-2 family proteins and Pim family proteins) pathways that co-operate with each other for CLL cell survival and maintenance. Vigorous efforts are being made to create small molecules that affect these proteins directly or indirectly. Several of these pharmacological inhibitors are in early clinical trials for patients with hematological malignancies.","['Chen, Lisa S', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Chen LS', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

DESCRIPTION OF CASES AND RESULTS: Authors described chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia according to established program. The fight for patient's life finished with success, but with side effect--ANFH. It was not diagnosed in an early period, because diagnosis was based only on X-ray of the hips. According to literature pain in the hip accompanying negative X-ray, should be supplemented with MRI, which allows confirmation of oedema of femur head bone marrow. Only early decompression in I degree of ANFH according to ARCO classification may stop a further progress of disease. Pain, impairment of gait, and necrosis covering over 30% of head was an indication for THA. CONCLUSION: THA of hip among young people is allowed when joints are completely destroyed and painful.","['Rapala, Kazimierz', 'Walczak, Piotr', 'Truszczynska, Aleksandra']","['Rapala K', 'Walczak P', 'Truszczynska A']",['Samodzielny Publiczny Szpital Kliniczny im. prof Adama Grucy w Otwocku. aleksandra.rapala@wp.pl'],['pol'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Chir Narzadow Ruchu Ortop Pol,Chirurgia narzadow ruchu i ortopedia polska,2985137R,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Decompression, Surgical/methods', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Femur Head Necrosis/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/11 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/08/11 06:00'],"['2010/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chir Narzadow Ruchu Ortop Pol. 2010 Mar-Apr;75(2):121-5.,,,,,,,,,Ortopedyczne problemy diagnostyczne i terapeutyczne w posterydowej jalowej martwicy glowy ko ci udowej w przebiegu ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej--opis 3 przypadkow.,,,,,,,

We present experimental data to complement already published and to complete dose-response findings for dietary OTA. From 34 rats, only four unilateral renal carcinomas (12%) developed during a 2-year exposure to dietary OTA, contaminated to give the same weekly overall dosage as in the 50 microg kg(-1) gavage-dosing regimen of an NTP study (30%). Statistical analysis included adjustment for premature leukaemia deaths, resulting in the carcinoma incidence of 35% (10-81%), and showed no significant difference from NTP (incidence of 43% (23-49%)) due to the smaller number of animals. However, absence of microscopic neoplastic renal lesions in premature decedents argues for minimal effect of the 47% leukaemia on carcinoma expression in the present experiment. This would fit with previously published findings showing significantly less carcinoma expression from a regimen administering an OTA dose in feed than was achieved by a lower dose by gavage as in the NTP study. It is concluded that chronic gavage administration of OTA to male rats may optimise carcinoma incidence for toxicological purposes, but that the dietary mode gives data more applicable to assessing putative health risk for humans.","['Mantle, Peter', 'Kulinskaya, Elena']","['Mantle P', 'Kulinskaya E']","['Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK. p.mantle@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess,"Food additives & contaminants.

One such treatment is based on the application of patients' cytotoxic T cells, which can be activated, expanded, and genetically engineered to recognize particular tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Because T cells recognizing TAAs might become unresponsive in the process of tumor development as a result of tumor evasion strategies, immunogenic viral antigens or alloantigens could be used for the expansion of cytotoxic T cells and then redirected through genetic engineering. This therapeutic approach has already demonstrated promising results in melanoma patients and could be used in the treatment of many other tumors. The graft-versus-leukemia, or more generally graft-versus-tumor, reaction based on the application of a donor lymphocyte infusion can also be ameliorated through the incorporation of suicide genes into donor lymphocytes.

The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate represented a major therapeutic advance over conventional CML therapy, with more than 90% of patients obtaining complete hematologic response, and 70%-80% of patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response. Despite the high efficacy of imatinib, a minority of patients in chronic phase CML and more patients in advanced phases are resistant to imatinib, or develop resistance during treatment. This is attributed, in 40% to 50% of cases, to the development of mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain that impair imatinib binding. Attempts to circumvent resistance led to the discovery of nilotinib (Tasigna), a novel, potent and selective oral Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor. AIMS: To review the evidence for the use of nilotinib in the management of CML. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance, and has further improved the treatment of CML. PLACE IN THERAPY: Nilotinib is currently indicated for patients with CML in chronic and accelerated phases following imatinib failure. Randomized studies are ongoing to assess the efficacy of nilotinib in patients with newly diagnosed CML.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100615,New Zealand,Core Evid,Core evidence,101256593,,,,PMC2899790,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/08/10 06:01,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/ce.s6003 [doi]'],epublish,Core Evid. 2010 Jun 15;4:207-13. doi: 10.2147/ce.s6003.,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'imatinib-intolerance', 'imatinib-resistance', 'nilotinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,

We conclude that germline CBL mutations have developmental, tumorigenic and functional consequences that resemble disorders that are caused by hyperactive Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Legius syndrome.","['Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Kang, Michelle W', 'Shin, Danielle H', 'Furlan, Ingrid', 'Erlacher, Miriam', 'Bunin, Nancy J', 'Bunda, Severa', 'Finklestein, Jerry Z', 'Gorr, Thomas A', 'Mehta, Parinda', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Kropshofer, Gabriele', 'Corbacioglu, Selim', 'Lang, Peter J', 'Klein, Christoph', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhard', 'Heinzmann, Andrea', 'Schneider, Michaela', 'Stary, Jan', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Sakai, Debbie', 'Archambeault, Sophie', 'Chen, Leslie', 'Russell, Ryan C', 'Sybingco, Stephanie S', 'Ohh, Michael', 'Braun, Benjamin S', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Loh, Mignon L']","['Niemeyer CM', 'Kang MW', 'Shin DH', 'Furlan I', 'Erlacher M', 'Bunin NJ', 'Bunda S', 'Finklestein JZ', 'Gorr TA', 'Mehta P', 'Schmid I', 'Kropshofer G', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Lang PJ', 'Klein C', 'Schlegel PG', 'Heinzmann A', 'Schneider M', 'Stary J', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Hasle H', 'Locatelli F', 'Sakai D', 'Archambeault S', 'Chen L', 'Russell RC', 'Sybingco SS', 'Ohh M', 'Braun BS', 'Flotho C', 'Loh ML']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada."", ""Miller Children's Hospital/Harbor-UCLA, Jonathan Jaques Cancer Center, Long Beach, CA, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich University, Munich, Germany."", 'University, Innsbruck, Austria;

METHODS: A total of 47 adult acute leukemia patients were studied - 24 patients treated with conventional CT containing anthracyclines (ANT) and 23 patients treated with HD-CT (myeloablative preparative regimen) followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Cardiac biomarkers were assessed prior to treatment (before CT/HD-CT), after first CT with ANT, after last CT with ANT in the first group, after HD-CT and after HCT in the second group. Values above the reference range were considered elevated. RESULTS: Before CT/HD-CT, all biomarkers of cardiac injury were below the cut-offs in all patients. GPBB increased above the cut-off (7.30 microg/L) in 4 (16.7%) patients after first CT and in 5 (20.8%) patients after last CT with ANT. GPBB increased above the cut-off in 5 (21.7%) patients after HD-CT and remained elevated in 5 (21.7%) patients after HCT. CTnI became elevated (above 0.40 microg/L) in 2 (8.3%) patients after first and last CT with ANT. Both patients with cTnI positivity had elevated GPBB. Other tested biomarkers remained below the cut-offs during the study. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that GPBB could become a sensitive biomarker for detection of acute cardiotoxicity associated with conventional CT containing ANT and HD-CT followed by HCT. The predictive value for development of cardiomyopathy in the future is not known and should be evaluated during a prospective follow-up. Based on our data, a larger prospective and multicenter study would be most desirable to define the potential role of new circulating biomarkers in the assessment of cardiotoxicity in oncology.","['Horacek, J M', 'Vasatova, M', 'Tichy, M', 'Pudil, R', 'Jebavy, L', 'Maly, J']","['Horacek JM', 'Vasatova M', 'Tichy M', 'Pudil R', 'Jebavy L', 'Maly J']","['Department of Medicine II - Clinical Hematology, University Hospital and Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. jan.hor@post.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FABP3 protein, human)', '0 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myoglobin)', '0 (Troponin I)', '0 (Troponin T)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glycogen Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (glycogen phosphorylase BB, human)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase, MB Form)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Creatine Kinase, MB Form/blood', 'Fatty Acid Binding Protein 3', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins/blood', 'Glycogen Phosphorylase/blood', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Myoglobin/blood', 'Troponin I/blood', 'Troponin T/blood']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['45/844 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2010 Jul;32(2):97-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The coding sequences of DH and PH domains of Bcr-Abl were cloned, and the recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies were produced and used for immunocytochemical study of Bcr and Bcr-Abl localization in K562 cells. RESULTS: The gene constructs containing sequences coding for DH and PH domains of Bcr-Abl have been obtained. The antibodies with relative specificity to corresponding recombinant proteins differ by the patterns of their intracellular reactivity with Bcr- and Bcr-Abl related structures. While Bcr protein is located predominantly perinuclearly, antibody against hybrid Bcr-Abl protein is reacted with the structures in cell periphery, namely on cell membranes. CONCLUSION: Antibodies against DH and PH domains of Bcr-Abl react with proteins located differently in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. The difference in intracellular localization of Bcr and Bcr-Abl may be attributable to the different domains interacting with different multiprotein complexes.","['Telegeev, G D', 'Dubrovska, A N', 'Nadgorna, V A', 'Dybkov, M V', 'Zavelevich, M P', 'Maliuta, S S', 'Gluzman, D F']","['Telegeev GD', 'Dubrovska AN', 'Nadgorna VA', 'Dybkov MV', 'Zavelevich MP', 'Maliuta SS', 'Gluzman DF']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics of NAS of Ukraine, Zabolotnogo 150, Kiev 03143, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['45/841 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2010 Jul;32(2):81-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunophenotype was CD45-/CD56+/CD9+ in around 50% of the mononuclear cells, indicating neuroectodermal origin of the malignant cells. Subsequently, the diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of a bone marrow biopsy. A review of the reported cases of neuroblastoma with leukemic features showed that several of them were misdiagnosed as having leukemia and that the diagnosis of neuroblastoma was made at autopsy examination, indicating that misdiagnosis may happen more often than is appreciated.

On the basis of bone marrow findings, Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL fusion gene, he was diagnosed as having chronic phase of secondary chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Two weeks after starting imatinib therapy, skin eruption, palpebral edema and appetite loss were observed; moreover, thrombocytopenia gradually worsened. He stopped taking imatinib and hydroxyurea was subsequently started. The above symptoms disappeared and the platelet count normalized. CML is rare in secondary leukemia.

METHODS: Two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (F-2D-DIGE) was performed to separate the total proteins from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell line HL-60 cells with or without 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2-dC) treatment. Imaging software Decyder 6.5 and PDQuest were used to detect the differential expression protein spots, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizaion time-of-flight mas spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was adopted to identify the differential expression proteins. RESULTS: F-2D-DIGE maps of 5-aza-2-dC-untreated HL-60 and-treated HL-60 cells were established. A total of 53 differential protein spots were detected, and 35 differential proteins were successfully identified. Of the identified proteins, 32 proteins were up-regulated, and 3 proteins were down-regulated in HL-60 cells after 5-aza-2-dC treatment. CONCLUSION: Thirty-five differential proteins may be associated with methylation in HL-60 cell line, which provides the important clues for epigenetic study of leukemia.","[""Tang, Can'e"", 'Tan, Tan', 'Xiao, Yanhua', 'Ruan, Lin', 'Li, Cui', 'Peng, Fang', 'Li, Maoyu', 'Zhang, Pengfei', 'Yi, Hong', 'Xiao, Zhiqiang']","['Tang C', 'Tan T', 'Xiao Y', 'Ruan L', 'Li C', 'Peng F', 'Li M', 'Zhang P', 'Yi H', 'Xiao Z']","['Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

In this study, we analyzed ASXL1 mutations in exon 12 in 501 adults with de novo AML. ASXL1 mutations were detected in 54 patients (10.8%), 8.9% among those with normal karyotype and 12.9% among those with abnormal cytogenetics. The mutation was closely associated with older age, male sex, isolated trisomy 8, RUNX1 mutation, and expression of human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD34, but inversely associated with t(15;17), complex cytogenetics, FLT3-internal tandem duplication, NPM1 mutations, WT1 mutations, and expression of CD33 and CD15. Patients with ASXL1 mutations had a shorter overall survival than patients without, but the mutation was not an independent adverse prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. Sequential analyses showed that the original ASXL1 mutations were lost at relapse and/or refractory status in 2 of the 6 relapsed ASXL1-mutated patients studied, whereas 2 of the 109 ASXL1-wild patients acquired a novel ASXL1 mutation at relapse. In conclusion, AML bearing ASXL1 mutations showed distinct clinical and biological features. The ASXL1 mutation status can change during disease evolution in a few patients.","['Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Huang, Huai-Hsuan', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Huang, Yen-Ning', 'Chang, Yi-Chang', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Min-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chou WC', 'Huang HH', 'Hou HA', 'Chen CY', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Tsay W', 'Ko BS', 'Wu SJ', 'Huang SY', 'Hsu SC', 'Chen YC', 'Huang YN', 'Chang YC', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. wchou@ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100806,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31046-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-283291 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 18;116(20):4086-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-283291.

Of 1064 patients registered, 1057 were evaluable. They were randomly assigned to receive either daunorubicin (50 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days) or idarubicin (12 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days) in combination with 100 mg/m(2) of cytarabine by continuous infusion daily for 7 days as induction therapy. Complete remission was achieved in 407 (77.5%) of 525 patients in the daunorubicin group and 416 (78.2%) of 532 in the idarubicin group (P = .79). Patients achieving complete remission received intensive postremission therapy that consisted of either 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine or 4 courses of standard-dose therapy.

Because modulation of IDO activities after viral infection may have great impact on disease progression, we investigated the role of IDO following infection with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus. We found suppressed BM5 provirus copies and increased type I IFNs in the spleen from IDO knockout (IDO(-/-)) and 1-methyl-D-L-tryptophan-treated mice compared with those from wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in IDO(-/-) mice was higher in the former than in the WT mice. In addition, neutralization of type I IFNs in IDO(-/-) mice resulted in an increase in LP-BM5 viral replication. Moreover, the survival rate of IDO(-/-) mice or 1-methyl-D-L-tryptophan-treated mice infected with LP-BM5 alone or with both Toxoplasma gondii and LP-BM5 was clearly greater than the survival rate of WT mice. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report to observe suppressed virus replication with upregulated type I IFN in IDO(-/-) mice, suggesting that modulation of the IDO pathway may be an effective strategy for treatment of virus infection.","['Hoshi, Masato', 'Saito, Kuniaki', 'Hara, Akira', 'Taguchi, Ayako', 'Ohtaki, Hirofumi', 'Tanaka, Ryo', 'Fujigaki, Hidetsugu', 'Osawa, Yosuke', 'Takemura, Masao', 'Matsunami, Hidetoshi', 'Ito, Hiroyasu', 'Seishima, Mitsuru']","['Hoshi M', 'Saito K', 'Hara A', 'Taguchi A', 'Ohtaki H', 'Tanaka R', 'Fujigaki H', 'Osawa Y', 'Takemura M', 'Matsunami H', 'Ito H', 'Seishima M']","['Department of Informative Clinical Medicine, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu City, Gifu Prefecture, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100806,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/genetics', 'Animals', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*deficiency/genetics', 'Interferon Type I/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/*enzymology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/enzymology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Replication/*immunology']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0901150 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0901150 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Sep 15;185(6):3305-12. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0901150.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated event-free survival (EFS) in 103 HL patients staged with fused 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) to identify those at greatest risk for abdominal relapse. The EFS of this series was compared with that of a historical cohort of 100 HL patients staged with separate FDG-PET and diagnostic CT acquisitions. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the 103 patients staged with FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT were found to have spleen involvement and 10 patients liver involvement, whereas 14 of the 100 patients staged with separate procedures were found to have spleen involvement and 3 patients liver involvement. There were significantly more intensive treatments (six courses of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and spleen radiation) in the fused PET/CT group than in the historical cohort (P </= 0.04). At a median follow-up of 27 months, five events occurred in the fused PET/CT group (HL relapse, 4 patients; carcinoma, 1 patient) and 19 events in the historical cohort (HL relapse, 18 patients; acute promyelocytic leukemia, 1 patient). Ten of the 18 relapses in the historical cohort were localized in the spleen and/or liver area. None of the four relapses in the fused PET/CT group was localized below the diaphragm. Thus, FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT-guided treatment resulted in a 95% EFS, whereas separate FDG-PET and diagnostic CT-guided treatment resulted in an 81% EFS (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT is an accurate frontline single imaging diagnostic tool enabling effective tailored treatment in HL patients.","['Picardi, M', 'Soricelli, A', 'Grimaldi, F', 'Nicolai, E', 'Gallamini, A', 'Pane, F']","['Picardi M', 'Soricelli A', 'Grimaldi F', 'Nicolai E', 'Gallamini A', 'Pane F']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples 'Federico II' University Medical School, Naples."", 'Fondazione SDN, Naples.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples 'Federico II' University Medical School, Naples."", 'Fondazione SDN, Naples.', 'Hematology Department, S.

Although internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) as an MRD marker has been questioned for its instability based on semi-quantitative methods, we hypothesized that FLT3-ITD dynamics measured by sensitive quantitative real-time PCR at early TPs before appearance of instability may provide prognostic information. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured mutant quantity in 493 serial samples from 55 patients with a median follow-up time of 64.8 months. The FLT3-ITD quantities after induction (TP1) and after the first post-induction chemotherapy (TP2) were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that lower FLT3-ITD levels at TP2 predicted longer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) regardless of cytogenetic risk. Multivariate analysis showed that >/=3 log reduction of FLT3-ITD at TP2 independently predicted better DFS and a trend toward better OS. FLT3-ITD disappeared at relapse in 16.7% of patients and none in those harboring mutant NPM1 compared with 29.4% in those with wild-type NPM1 (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Though the mutation may disappear at relapse in a few patients, FLT3-ITD levels at early TPs after chemotherapy provide prognostic information. FLT3-ITD is significantly more stable in those with mutant NPM1.","['Chou, W-C', 'Hou, H-A', 'Liu, C-Y', 'Chen, C-Y', 'Lin, L-I', 'Huang, Y-N', 'Chao, Y-C', 'Hsu, C-A', 'Huang, C-F', 'Tien, H-F']","['Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Liu CY', 'Chen CY', 'Lin LI', 'Huang YN', 'Chao YC', 'Hsu CA', 'Huang CF', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei.', 'Department of Nursing, Biostatistics Consulting Laboratory, National Taipei College of Nursing, Taipei.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei.

Despite the success of imatinib, multiple mechanisms of resistance remain a problem, including overexpression of Lyn kinase (Lyn) and Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins. Profiling micro-RNA (miRNA) expression in a model of Lyn-mediated imatinib-resistant CML (MYL-R) identified approximately 30 miRNAs whose expression differed >2-fold compared with drug-sensitive MYL cells. In particular, the expression of the miR181 family (a-d) was significantly reduced ( approximately 11- to 25-fold) in MYL-R cells. Incubation of MYL-R cells with a Lyn inhibitor (dasatinib) or nucleofection with Lyn-targeting short interfering RNA increased miR181b and miR181d expression. A similar Lyn-dependent regulation of miR181b and miR181d was observed in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells. Sequence analysis of potential targets for miR181 regulation predicted myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2 family member whose expression is increased in MYL-R cells and drug-resistant leukemias. Inhibition of Lyn or rescue of miR181b expression reduced Mcl-1 expression in the MYL-R cells. To further investigate the mechanism of Mcl-1 repression by miR181, a luciferase reporter construct incorporating the Mcl-1 3'-untranslated region was tested. Overexpression of miR181b reduced luciferase activity, whereas these effects were ablated by the mutation of the seed region of the miR181 target site. Finally, stimulation of Lyn expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment in HL-60 cells, a cell model of acute myelogenous leukemia, decreased miR181b expression and increased Mcl-1 expression. In summary, our results suggest that Lyn-dependent regulation of miR181 is a novel mechanism of regulating Mcl-1 expression and cell survival.","['Zimmerman, Eric I', 'Dollins, Claudia M', 'Crawford, Melissa', 'Grant, Steven', 'Nana-Sinkam, Serge P', 'Richards, Kristy L', 'Hammond, Scott M', 'Graves, Lee M']","['Zimmerman EI', 'Dollins CM', 'Crawford M', 'Grant S', 'Nana-Sinkam SP', 'Richards KL', 'Hammond SM', 'Graves LM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7365, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM008581/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM008581-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100806,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",PMC2981365,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.110.066258 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.110.066258 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 Nov;78(5):811-7. doi: 10.1124/mol.110.066258.

However, its use has been limited by a high rate of hypersensitivity reactions and development of neutrolizing anti-asparaginase antibodies, and by the need of frequent administration. To overcome these limitations modified versions of L-asparaginase (such as asparaginase from other sources, pegylated formulations, and asparaginase loaded into erythrocytes) have been recently proposed.

However, six of nine preparations were found to be cytotoxic to SQ-5 using the neutral red uptake assay. One of these eye drop preparations induced release of LDH within 1 min from SQ-5 cells and within 5 min from HL60 cells. This preparation also induced a three-fold increase in LDH activity in tears, 10 sec after its application to human eyes, suggesting that cells in contact with the tears were injured by the eye drops in vivo. An eye drop preparation that had no detectable cytotoxicity in vitro caused no change of LDH activity in human tears. LDH release assay has therefore been shown to be a useful method for detecting a direct relationship between in vitro cytotoxicity and weak in situ cytotoxicity to human eyes.","['Sasaki, T', 'Ohno, T']","['Sasaki T', 'Ohno T']","['RIKEN Cell Bank, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Koyadai, Tsukuba Science City, Japan; Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, 3333-26 Aza-Asayama, Ooaza-Kamitezuna, Takahagi, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,,,,,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['1993/08/17 00:00 [received]', '1994/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]']","['0887-2333(94)90252-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0887-2333(94)90252-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 1994 Oct;8(5):1113-9. doi: 10.1016/0887-2333(94)90252-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major drawback of this test is its use of primary cells derived from rat embryos. The stem-cell test is a novel assay for teratogenic potential which uses a propagated cell line. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) are maintained in an undifferentiated state in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). On removing LIF, the cells differentiate into an embryonic endoderm that is morphologically distinct from ESC. Colonies of ESC are maintained from which cells can be harvested daily, and these cells, when washed free of LIF, form a population of differentiating cells on which the effects of chemicals can be tested. The conditions under which differentiating ESC can be substituted for rat primary embryonic cells in a micromass test protocol have been determined, and the effects of 25 compounds investigated in a blind trial. The stem-cell test predicted the teratogenicity of these compounds with a similar sensitivity and specificity to the micromass test, with the advantage that the test uses a propagated cell line; there is no use of animals.","['Newall, D R', 'Beedles, K E']","['Newall DR', 'Beedles KE']","['Genetic and Reproductive Toxicology, Glaxo Group Research Ltd, Ware, Herts.

The anthrones anthralin and chrysarobin were 4.1 and 3.2 times more toxic, respectively, in the cloning efficiency assay than in the MTT assay. In contrast, the anthraquinones danthron and emodin were 2.8 and 2.1 times more toxic, respectively, in the MTT assay than in the cloning efficiency assay. Among the four mammalian cell lines tested using the MTT assay, the human leukaemia cell line (K562) was the most sensitive to the test chemicals. In contast, anthraquinone toxicity was reduced in rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cultures. In general, structures with carbonyl groups in positions 9 and 10 on the anthracene skeleton (anthraquinones) were less toxic than structures with carbonyl groups in position 9 only (anthrones). Toxicity was also influenced by the position of hydroxy substituents on the tricyclic skeleton. The results suggested that in vitro cytotoxicity assays are useful in elucidating the relationships between structure and biological activity for anthraquinones and related compounds.","['Bondy, G S', 'Armstrong, C L', 'Dawson, B A', 'Heroux-Metcalf, C', 'Neville, G A', 'Rogers, C G']","['Bondy GS', 'Armstrong CL', 'Dawson BA', 'Heroux-Metcalf C', 'Neville GA', 'Rogers CG']","['Toxicology Research Division, Bureau of Chemical Safety, Food Directorate, Health Protection Branch, Health and Welfare Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0L2.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,,,,,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['1993/04/27 00:00 [received]', '1993/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['0887-2333(94)90153-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0887-2333(94)90153-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 1994 Jun;8(3):329-35. doi: 10.1016/0887-2333(94)90153-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of LOX-1 is involved in the pathobiological effects of oxLDL in endothelial cells, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and leukocytic adhesion. Moderate consumption of phenolic-enriched food may have a protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis via the antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds at the endothelial level. In this study, we determined whether ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound widely distributed in fruits and nuts, protects against oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction by modulating the LOX-1-mediated signaling pathway. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with ellagic acid at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 muM for 2 hours and then incubated with oxLDL (150 mug/mL) for an additional 24 hours. RESULTS: LOX-1 protein expression was markedly lower after exposure to oxLDL in HUVECs pretreated with ellagic acid or diphenyleneiodonium, a well-known inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, than in HUVECs exposed to oxLDL alone, suggesting that ellagic acid deactivates NADPH oxidase. We also found that oxLDL activated the membrane assembly of p47phox, Rac1, gp91 and p22phox, and the subsequent induction of ROS generation; however, ROS generation was markedly suppressed in cells pretreated with ellagic acid or anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody. In addition, oxLDL down-regulated eNOS and up-regulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS), thereby augmenting the formation of NO and protein nitrosylation. Furthermore, oxLDL induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, activated the NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules interleukin-(IL) 6 and IL-8 and the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin, and stimulated the adherence of THP-1 (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) to HUVECs. Pretreatment with ellagic acid, however, exerted significant cytoprotective effects in all events. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study may provide insight into a possible molecular mechanism by which ellagic acid inhibits LOX-1-induced endothelial dysfunction. Our data indicate that ellagic acid exerts its protective effects by inhibiting NADPH oxidase-induced overproduction of superoxide, suppressing the release of NO by down-regulating iNOS, enhancing cellular antioxidant defenses, and attenuating oxLDL-induced LOX-1 up-regulation and eNOS down-regulation.","['Lee, Wen-Jane', 'Ou, Hsiu-Chung', 'Hsu, Wen-Cheng', 'Chou, Min-Min', 'Tseng, Jenn-Jhy', 'Hsu, Shih-Lan', 'Tsai, Kun-Ling', 'Sheu, Wayne Huey-Herng']","['Lee WJ', 'Ou HC', 'Hsu WC', 'Chou MM', 'Tseng JJ', 'Hsu SL', 'Tsai KL', 'Sheu WH']","['Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100808,United States,J Vasc Surg,Journal of vascular surgery,8407742,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (OLR1 protein, human)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class E)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '19YRN3ZS9P (Ellagic Acid)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ellagic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class E/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0741-5214(10)01348-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jvs.2010.04.085 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vasc Surg. 2010 Nov;52(5):1290-300. doi: 10.1016/j.jvs.2010.04.085.

Furthermore, which functional genomics approaches will be tractable for schistosomes are not yet apparent. Here, the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)-pseudotyped pantropic retroviral vector pBABE-puro was modified to incorporate the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) as a reporter, under the control of the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR). Pseudotyped virions were employed to transduce S. japonicum to investigate the utility of retrovirus-mediated transgenesis of S. japonicum and the activity of human telomerase reverse transcriptase as a reporter transgene in schistosomes. Schistosomules perfused from experimentally infected rabbits were cultured for 6 days after exposure to the virions after which genomic DNAs from virus exposed and control worms were extracted. Analysis of RNA from transduced parasites and immunohistochemistry of thin parasite sections revealed expression of hTERT in the transduced worms. Expression of hTERT was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis. These findings indicated that S. japonicum could be effectively transduced by VSVG-pseudotyped retrovirus carrying the hTERT gene. Given the potential of hTERT to aid in derivation of immortalized cells, these findings suggest that this pantropic retroviral approach can be employed to transduce cells from specific tissues and organs of schistosomes to investigate the influence of transgene hTERT on growth and proliferation of schistosome cells.","['Yang, Shenghui', 'Brindley, Paul J', 'Zeng, Qingren', 'Li, Yuesheng', 'Zhou, Jun', 'Liu, Yan', 'Liu, Biyuan', 'Cai, Liting', 'Zeng, Tiebing', 'Wei, Qi', 'Lan, Lingmei', 'McManus, Donald P']","['Yang S', 'Brindley PJ', 'Zeng Q', 'Li Y', 'Zhou J', 'Liu Y', 'Liu B', 'Cai L', 'Zeng T', 'Wei Q', 'Lan L', 'McManus DP']","['Centre of Cell and Molecular Biology Experiment, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan province, China.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI072773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI072773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100806,Netherlands,Mol Biochem Parasitol,Molecular and biochemical parasitology,8006324,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rabbits', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Schistosoma japonicum/genetics/growth & development/metabolism/*virology', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3836731,['NIHMS501144'],2010/08/10 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-6851(10)00200-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biochem Parasitol. 2010 Dec;174(2):109-16. doi: 10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.07.007.

Using spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) as a model system, we show that mTORC1 impairs stem cell maintenance by a negative feedback from mTORC1 to receptors required to transduce niche-derived signals. We find that SPCs lacking Plzf, a transcription factor essential for SPC maintenance, have enhanced mTORC1 activity. Aberrant mTORC1 activation in Plzf(-/-) SPCs inhibits their response to GDNF, a growth factor critical for SPC self-renewal, via negative feedback at the level of the GDNF receptor. Plzf opposes mTORC1 activity by inducing expression of the mTORC1 inhibitor Redd1. Thus, we identify the mTORC1-Plzf functional interaction as a critical rheostat for maintenance of the spermatogonial pool and propose a model whereby negative feedback from mTORC1 to the GDNF receptor balances SPC growth with self-renewal.","['Hobbs, Robin M', 'Seandel, Marco', 'Falciatori, Ilaria', 'Rafii, Shahin', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Hobbs RM', 'Seandel M', 'Falciatori I', 'Rafii S', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA102142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102142-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Testis/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC3210556,['NIHMS219807'],2010/08/10 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(10)00731-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2010.06.041 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2010 Aug 6;142(3):468-79. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2010.06.041.,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Patients were identified as high risk of relapse based on serial monitoring of post-HSCT BCR-ABL transcript levels, and patients in the high-risk group were given individualized intervention. Interventions included immunosuppressant withdrawal, modified donor lymphocyte infusion, and imatinib mesylate. Engraftment was successful in all patients. Twenty-eight patients were categorized as high risk because of higher post-HSCT BCR-ABL transcript levels and received intervention. The 56 low-risk patients received no intervention. Twenty-five high-risk patients achieved complete molecular remission at a median of 49 days (range: 18-232 days) after intervention. Two high-risk patients and 1 low-risk patient ultimately relapsed, the 4-year relapse rate was 3.9% +/- 4.4%. Overall 4-year survival was 89.0% +/- 7% and the 4-year LFS was 89.2% +/- 6.8%. All surviving patients remains in complete molecular remission after a median of 1481 (1040-1794) days follow-up.

The resulting bioconjugate self-assembled spontaneously in water as nanoparticles that displayed a promising in vivo anticancer activity. The aim of the present study was to provide further insight into the in vitro subcellular localization and on the metabolization pathway of the prodrug. Cells treated with radiolabelled squalenoyl gemcitabine (SQdFdC) were studied by differential detergent permeation, and microautography coupled to fluorescent immunolabeling and confocal microscopy. This revealed that the bioconjugate accumulated within cellular membranes, especially in those of the endoplasmic reticulum. Radio-chromatography analysis proved that SQdFdC delivered dFdC directly in the cell cytoplasm. Mass spectrometry studies confirmed that gemcitabine was then either converted into its biologically active triphosphate metabolite or exported from the cells through membrane transporters. To our knowledge, this is the first description of such an intracellular drug delivery pathway. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that SQdFdC was more active than dFdC on a transporter-deficient human resistant leukemia model, which was explained by the subcellular distribution of the drugs and their metabolites.

Although most cases have been reported in Jamaica, ID may be seen in other HTLV-1 endemic areas, such as Brazil, Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago. Since HTLV-1 infection has been implicated in the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, an aggressive hematologic malignancy, and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, a neurodegenerative disease, ID may serve as an early clinical marker for either condition. Although HTLV-1-associated infective dermatitis is considered by most to be rare, it has been increasingly diagnosed over the past 20 years; some suggest ID may be underdiagnosed. One should maintain suspicion of HTLV-1 infection among individuals in or from endemic areas, recognizing the clinical features and prognostic implications of infectious dermatitis.","['Lee, Robert', 'Schwartz, Robert A']","['Lee R', 'Schwartz RA']","['Dermatology, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100805,United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Adult', 'Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communicable Disease Control/*organization & administration', 'Dermatitis/epidemiology/physiopathology/virology', 'Developing Countries', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Jamaica/epidemiology', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/diagnosis/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Trinidad and Tobago/epidemiology']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2011/01/25 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2009/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0190-9622(09)01350-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2009.10.021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2011 Jan;64(1):152-60. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.10.021.

From three large medical centers over a 10-year period, we identified 32 MDS cases where del(11q) was present either as a sole (n=23) or associated with another abnormality (n=9), showing an overall 0.6% frequency in MDS. These patients included 15 men and 17 women, with a median age of 68 years. Three were therapy-related, and 29 were primary MDS. These cases were characterized by transfusion-dependent anemia (65%); frequent ring sideroblasts (RS) (59%); bone marrow hypocellularity (22%), and less severe thrombocytopenia. With a median follow-up of 32 months, 9/24 (38%) cases progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the overall survival (OS) was 35 months (3-105). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed MLL deletion in 6/10 cases, but no cryptic MLL translocations in all 15 MDS cases tested. In contrast, FISH performed in AML with del(11q) showed MLL rearrangement in 3/17 (18%) cases. In summary, del(11)q occurring in a non-complex karyotype is predominantly associated with primary MDS, lack of cryptic MLL rearrangements, and shows characteristic clinicopathological features. These clinicopathological features are likely attributed to commonly deleted regions of 11q and their involved genes.","['Wang, Sa A', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Hu, Ying', 'Zhang, Yanpeng', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Galili, Naomi', 'Raza, Azar', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Miranda, Roberto N']","['Wang SA', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Zhang L', 'Hu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao M', 'Galili N', 'Raza A', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Miranda RN']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA. swang5@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20100805,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics']",,,2010/08/10 06:00,2011/05/18 06:00,['2010/08/10 06:00'],"['2010/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00361-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Mar;35(3):351-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.07.018.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and Western blot to study the expression of TSHR, TRalpha1, TRalpha2, and TRbeta1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins in human endometrium. RESULT(S): We found TSHR, TRalpha1, TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 mRNA and proteins expressed in human endometrium. Immunostaining for TSHR in the luminal epithelium and TRalpha1 and beta1 in the glandular and luminal epithelium increased statistically significantly on luteinizing hormone (LH) days 6 to 9, coinciding with appearance of pinopodes. Endometrial stromal and Ishikawa cells expressed mRNA for TSHR, TR, and iodothyronine deiodinases 1-3. After 48 hours, TSH significantly increased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptor (LIFR) messenger RNA (mRNA) in endometrial stromal cells, but decreased their expression in Ishikawa cells. Glucose transporter 1 mRNA was up-regulated by TSH in Ishikawa cells. We found that TSH statistically significantly increased secretion of free triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) by Ishikawa cells compared with nonstimulated cells.

Oncologists regularly use methadone as a long-lasting analgesic. Recently it has also been proposed as a promising agent in leukemia therapy, especially when conventional therapies are not effective. Nevertheless, numerous reports indicate a negative impact on human cognition with chronic exposure to opiates. Thus, clarification of methadone toxicity is required. In SH-SY5Y cells we found that high concentrations of methadone were required to induce cell death. Methadone-induced cell death seems to be related to necrotic processes rather than typical apoptosis. Cell cultures challenged with methadone presented alterations in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. A mechanism that involves Bax translocation to the mitochondria was observed, accompanied with cytochrome c release. Furthermore, no participation of known protein regulators of apoptosis such as Bcl-X(L) and p53 was observed. Interestingly, methadone-induced cell death took place by a caspases-independent pathway; perhaps due to its ability to induce a drastic depletion in cellular ATP levels. Therefore, we studied the effect of methadone on isolated rat liver mitochondria.

Ghrelin and obestatin, derived from the post-translational processing of preproghrelin, are involved in a diverse range of biological activities, yet their effect on the immune system is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the roles of ghrelin and obestatin on mast cell degranulation and found that both ghrelin and obestatin induce the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells. This induced histamine release was inhibited by the pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Galpha(i) protein, and extracellular Ca(2+). Rat peritoneal mast cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells did not express the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a, suggesting that histamine release induced by ghrelin occurs via a receptor-independent mechanism.

MALDI application detected all core MuLV proteins, partial degradation of p10, phosphorylation of p12, as well as the previously unknown formation of a polymeric supramolecular complex between p15 and p30 core proteins.

In this study, we provide a global survey on the binding location of EGR1 in the K562 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing. Over 14 000 highly confident in vivo EGR1 binding sites were identified in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated K562 cells. More than 70% of these genomic sites associated with EGR1 binding were located around annotated gene regions. Molecular functional classification of 6138 putative EGR1 target genes showed that the transcription factor class (695 of 6138; 11%) is the largest significantly enriched one. The results showed that a high coverage of the genome and a high positive rate achieve were achieved.

The anticancer activities in vitro and the cell apoptosis-induction abilities of SMT-A07 on human leukemia HL60 and NB4 cell lines were investigated in this study. The results of MTT assay showed SMT-A07 was a potential and highly efficient antitumor compound with IC(50) values ranging from 0.09 to 1.19 muM in five leukemia cell lines. SMT-A07 treatment for 24 h caused the increment of apoptosis rate from 6.88 to 49.72% in HL60 cells and from 8.72 to 56.28% in NB4 cells by flow cytometry analysis. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed DNA fragmentation that appeared after cells were exposed to SMT-A07. After SMT-A07 incubation, DAPI staining revealed the presence of DNA fragmentation, and perinuclear apoptotic body. SMT-A07 also resulted in a loss of DeltaPsim in both HL60 and NB4 cells by JC-1 staining. Moreover, apoptosis-related proteins were examined by western blotting to explore the mechanism of its cytotoxicity. SMT-A07 exposure caused down-regulation and cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase-3, Bid, PARP and up-regulation of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, PARP (Cleaved Fragment). In addition, the presence of pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-D-FMK prevented cells from caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that SMT-A07 displays an apparent antitumor activity with extensive anti-leukemia spectrum, and SMT-A07 can induce the apoptosis of HL60 and NB4 cells activation of the caspase cascade, which deserves further development.","['Qian, Shijing', 'Cao, Ji', 'Yan, Yan', 'Sun, Maotang', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Hu, Yongzhou', 'He, Qiaojun', 'Yang, Bo']","['Qian S', 'Cao J', 'Yan Y', 'Sun M', 'Zhu H', 'Hu Y', 'He Q', 'Yang B']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100806,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0', '(N-(2-(1H-indazol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole(3,2-b)pyridin-5-yl)-4-chloro-N-methylbenzamide', ')', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,2010/08/07 06:00,2011/03/24 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-010-0554-y [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2010 Dec;345(1-2):13-21. doi: 10.1007/s11010-010-0554-y.

Apoptogenic activity was frequent, even in strains cultured for decades, and was unrelated to whether the cyanobacteria had been collected from polar, temperate, or tropic environments. The activity was more abundant in the genera Anabaena and Microcystis compared to Nostoc, Phormidium, Planktothrix, and Pseudanabaena. Whereas the T-cell lymphoma apoptogens were frequent in organic extracts, the cell death-inducing activity towards leukemia cells resided mainly in aqueous extracts. The cyanobacteria were from a culture collection established for public health purposes to detect toxic cyanobacterial blooms, and 54 of them were tested for toxicity by the mouse bioassay. We found no correlation between the apoptogenic activity in the cyanobacterial isolates with their content of microcystin, nor with their ability to elicit a positive standard mouse bioassay. Several strains produced more than one apoptogen, differing in biophysical or biological activity. In fact, two strains contained microcystin in addition to one apoptogen specific for the AML cells, and one apoptogen specific for the T-cell lymphoma.

This phenomenon displaces the leukocytes to the vessel wall and is aptly termed as margination. Here, we demonstrate using microfluidics that stiffer malaria-infected RBCs (iRBCs) behave similar to leukocytes and undergo margination towards the sidewalls. This provides better understanding of the hemodynamic effects of iRBCs in microcirculation and its contribution to pathophysiological outcome relating to cytoadherence to endothelium. In this work, cell margination is mimicked for the separation of iRBCs from whole blood based on their reduced deformability. The malaria infected sample was tested in a simple long straight channel microfluidic device fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane. In this microchannel, cell margination was directed along the channel width with the iRBCs aligning near each sidewall and then subsequently removed using a 3-outlet system, thus achieving separation. Tests were conducted using ring stage and late trophozoite/schizont stage iRBCs. Device performance was quantified by analyzing the distribution of these iRBCs across the microchannel width at the outlet and also conducting flow cytometry analysis. Results indicate recovery of approximately 75% for early stage iRBCs and >90% for late stage iRBCs at the side outlets. The simple and passive system operation makes this technique ideal for on-site iRBCs enrichment in resource-limited settings, and can be applied to other blood cell diseases, e.g. sickle cell anemia and leukemia, characterized by changes in cell stiffness.","['Hou, Han Wei', 'Bhagat, Ali Asgar S', 'Chong, Alvin Guo Lin', 'Mao, Pan', 'Tan, Kevin Shyong Wei', 'Han, Jongyoon', 'Lim, Chwee Teck']","['Hou HW', 'Bhagat AA', 'Chong AG', 'Mao P', 'Tan KS', 'Han J', 'Lim CT']","['Division of Bioengineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore, 117574, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Cell Separation/*instrumentation', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Erythrocyte Aggregation/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Malaria/*blood', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation']",,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c003873c [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2010 Oct 7;10(19):2605-13. doi: 10.1039/c003873c.

We have recently shown that the PSC acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling in hematopoietic progenitors (prohemocytes), thereby preserving the multipotent character necessary for their differentiation into lamellocytes, a cryptic and dedicated immune cell type required to fight specific immune threats such as wasp parasitism. In this report, on the basis of a knock out generated by homologous recombination, we show that a short type I cytokine-related receptor CG14225/Latran is required for switching off JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes. This is a prerequisite to massive differentiation of lamellocytes upon wasp parasitisation. In vivo and cell culture assays indicate that Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonises Domeless activity in a dose-dependent manner. Our analysis further shows that a primary immune response to wasp parasitism is a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the latran/domeless ratio. We propose that this sequence of events culminates in the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling by Latran. JAK/STAT activity has been associated with several human diseases including leukaemia while knock-out studies in mice point to a central role of this pathway in hematopoiesis and regulation of immune functions. The specific function of Drosophila Latran is, to our knowledge, the first in vivo example of a role for a nonsignalling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response, and thus raises the question of whether short, nonsignalling receptors also control specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity.","['Makki, Rami', 'Meister, Marie', 'Pennetier, Delphine', 'Ubeda, Jean-Michel', 'Braun, Anne', 'Daburon, Virginie', 'Krzemien, Joanna', 'Bourbon, Henri-Marc', 'Zhou, Rui', 'Vincent, Alain', 'Crozatier, Michele']","['Makki R', 'Meister M', 'Pennetier D', 'Ubeda JM', 'Braun A', 'Daburon V', 'Krzemien J', 'Bourbon HM', 'Zhou R', 'Vincent A', 'Crozatier M']","['Universite Toulouse 3, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100803,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Orc3 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Hemocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Janus Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Wasps/physiology']",PMC2914635,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pbio.1000441 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Biol. 2010 Aug 3;8(8):e1000441. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000441.,,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,

The cDNAs encoding B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), interferon (IFN)-beta2 and a 26-kDa protein were independently cloned in 1986, which in turn led to the identification of each. To resolve the confusing nomenclature, these identical molecules were named IL-6. Characterization of IL-6 revealed a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in not only immune responses but also hematopoiesis, inflammation, and bone metabolism. Moreover, IL-6 makes significant contributions to such autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).IL-6 activates both the STAT3 and SHP2/Gab/MAPK signaling pathways via the gp130 signal transducer. F759 mice, which contain a single amino-acid substitution in gp130 (Y759F) and show enhanced STAT3 activation, spontaneously develop a RA-like arthritis as they age. F759 arthritis is dependent on CD4(+) T cells, IL-6, and IL-17A, and is enhanced by the pX gene product from human T cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1). Arthritis development in these mice requires that the F759 mutation is present in nonhematopoietic cells, but not in immune cells, highlighting the important role of the interaction between nonimmune tissues and the immune system in this disease. Furthermore, this interaction is mediated by the IL-6 amplifier through STAT3 and NF-kappaB. Ultimately, this model may represent a general etiologic process underlying other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. More importantly, the understanding of IL-6 has paved the way for new therapeutic approaches for RA and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","['Hirano, Toshio']",['Hirano T'],"['JST-CREST, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Japan. hirano@molonc.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Japan Academy.

It is controversial whether inv(9) is a predisposing factor for acute leukemia (AL). The effect of inv(9) on bone marrow (BM) recovery after stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy is undetermined. Between March 2001 and December 2008, the cytogenetics of 3,809 patients with suspected hematological diseases were reviewed. Of them, 586 patients were diagnosed with AL. Constitutional inv(9) was found in 55 patients with various hematological disorders, including AL and solid tumors. The proportion of inv(9) was similar in patients with AL (8/586, 1.37%) and those without (47/3223, 1.46%; p = 1.0). Of the eight patients with AL and inv(9), one refused treatment and seven had induction chemotherapy. Four of the seven patients achieved prompt hematological recovery, but the other three failed to achieve complete hematological remission. Thus constitutional inv(9) seems not to be related independently to delayed hematological recovery. One recipient of an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, from an unrelated donor with constitutional inv(9), also achieved prompt hematological reconstruction, further suggesting that constitutional inv(9) has no effect on hematopoietic cells. In summary, our data suggest that constitutional inv(9) is a truly random chromosomal aberration with no apparent functional effect on hematological disorders.","['Lee, Sang-Guk', 'Park, Tae Sung', 'Lim, Gayoung', 'Lee, Kyung-A', 'Song, Jaewoo', 'Choi, Jong Rak']","['Lee SG', 'Park TS', 'Lim G', 'Lee KA', 'Song J', 'Choi JR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Korea', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['40/3/273 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2010 Summer;40(3):273-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify genes and components associated with this oncogene we used Drosophila as a genetic model. Expression of AML1-ETO caused an expansion of hematopoietic precursors in Drosophila, which expressed high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mutations in functional domains of the fusion protein suppress the proliferative phenotype. In a genetic screen, we found that inactivation of EcRB1 or activation of Foxo and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) suppress the AML1-ETO-induced phenotype by reducing ROS expression in the precursor cells. Our studies indicate that ROS is a signaling factor promoting maintenance of normal as well as the aberrant myeloid precursors and suggests the importance of antioxidant enzymes and their regulators as targets for further study in the context of leukemia.","['Sinenko, Sergey A', 'Hung, Tony', 'Moroz, Tatiana', 'Tran, Quynh-Minh', 'Sidhu, Sohrab', 'Cheney, Matthew D', 'Speck, Nancy A', 'Banerjee, Utpal']","['Sinenko SA', 'Hung T', 'Moroz T', 'Tran QM', 'Sidhu S', 'Cheney MD', 'Speck NA', 'Banerjee U']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA108056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL067395/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 HL067395/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (FOXO protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (ecdysone receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (superoxide dismutase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drosophila/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/*metabolism', 'Hemocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Larva/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",PMC2996118,,2010/08/07 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31017-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-276998 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4612-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-276998.

The 5 or more extra chromosomes characterizing this subtype are known to occur in a single mitotic event, prenatally. We screened for RAS mutations among 517 acute childhood leukemias (including 437 lymphocytic, of which 393 were B-cell subtypes) and found mutations in 30% of high hyperdiploids compared to only 10% of leukemias of other subtypes (P<0.0001). We assessed whether KRAS mutations occurred before birth using a PCR-restriction enzyme-mediated Taqman quantitative PCR reaction, and found no evidence for prenatal KRAS mutations in 14 patients tested. While RAS mutations were previously associated with prior chemical exposures in childhood and adult leukemias, in this study RAS-mutated cases were not significantly associated with parental smoking when compared to study controls. IGH rearrangements were backtracked in three RAS-positive patients (which were negative for KRAS mutation at birth) and found to be evident before birth, confirming a prenatal origin for the leukemia clone. We posit a natural history for hyperdiploid leukemia in which prenatal mitotic catastrophe is followed by a postnatal RAS mutation to produce the leukemic cell phenotype.","['Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Kang, Michelle', 'Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Zheng, Lily', 'Kouyoumji, Carina', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Buffler, Patricia', 'Wiencke, John K']","['Wiemels JL', 'Kang M', 'Chang JS', 'Zheng L', 'Kouyoumji C', 'Zhang L', 'Smith MT', 'Scelo G', 'Metayer C', 'Buffler P', 'Wiencke JK']","['Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, CA 94158, USA. joe.wiemels@ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25-CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",PMC2943008,['NIHMS224426'],2010/08/07 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(10)00164-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2010 Oct 15;45(3):186-91. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.07.007.

Murine leukemia virus (MLV) constitutes a useful model to study when and where dimerization occurs within the cell. For instance, MLV produces a subgenomic RNA (called SD') that is co-packaged with the genomic RNA predominantly as FLSD' heterodimers. This SD' RNA is generated by splicing of the genomic RNA and also by direct transcription of a splice-associated retroelement of MLV (SDARE). We took advantage of these two SD' origins to study the effects of transcription and splicing events on RNA dimerization. Using genetic approaches coupled to capture of RNA heterodimer in virions, we determined heterodimerization frequencies in different cellular contexts. Several cell lines were stably established in which SD' RNA was produced by either splicing or transcription from SDARE. Moreover, SDARE was integrated into the host chromosome either concomitantly or sequentially with the genomic provirus. Our results showed that transcribed genomic and SD' RNAs preferentially formed heterodimers when their respective proviruses were integrated together. In contrast, heterodimerization was strongly affected when the two proviruses were integrated independently. Finally, dimerization was enhanced when the transcription sites were expected to be physically close. For the first time, we report that splicing and RNA dimerization appear to be coupled. Indeed, when the RNAs underwent splicing, the FLSD' dimerization reached a frequency similar to co-transcriptional heterodimerization. Altogether, our results indicate that randomness of heterodimerization increases when RNAs are co-expressed during either transcription or splicing. Our results strongly support the notion that dimerization occurs in the nucleus, at or near the transcription and splicing sites, at areas of high viral RNA concentration.","['Maurel, Stephan', 'Mougel, Marylene']","['Maurel S', 'Mougel M']","[""Universite Montpellier 1, Centre d'etudes d'agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Sante (CPBS), CNRS, UMR 5236, 4 Bd Henri IV, 34965 Montpellier, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Dimerization', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Proviruses/physiology', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Integration']",PMC2925334,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-64 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Aug 5;7:64. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, VRE of genotype vanC appear not to be associated with outbreaks. The goal of this study was to estimate the risk of bloodstream infections in patients colonized with VRE of genotype vanC who received care from a bone marrow transplant unit for patients with leukemia, where only standard precautions were implemented for VRE of genotype vanC during the last 9 years. METHODS: Since 2000, all patients in the bone marrow transplant unit underwent routine VRE rectal screening, data were prospectively entered in a database, and isolates were molecularly characterized. Infection control policy required contact isolation for patients infected with VRE of genotype vanA or vanB but only standard precautions for patients infected with VRE of genotype vanC. RESULTS: From January 2000 to July 2008, 290 isolates of VRE of genotype vanC obtained from 273 different patients were identified, with an incidence of 25-43 isolates/year. Of 290 isolates, 285 (98%) were identified in rectal screening swabs, 5 were from other body sites, and none required specific treatment. During the entire study period, only 1 case of bloodstream infection was detected, reflecting an incidence of 1 (0.4%) of the 273 patients, or <0.2 cases per 1000 patient-days. No outbreaks were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide strong evidence that carriers of VRE of genotype vanC do not require contact isolation, thereby saving resources and potentially improving patient care.

Compared to healthy tissues, the global expression of miRNAs in cancerous tissue is frequently down-regulated. Likewise in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), down-regulation of several miRNAs has been reported. Analysis of miRNA promoters for epigenetic modifications revealed a stronger methylation of down-regulated miRNAs in CLL. To date, several target genes affected by deregulated miRNAs have been identified that have impact on CLL pathogenesis. The best-described consequence of miRNA deregulation is for miRNA-15/16 cluster deletion, which is frequently down-regulated in a subgroup of patients with CLL carrying 13q14 deletion. So far, models for miRNA deregulation have addressed just single miRNAs. For assessment of complete miRNA deregulation, further evaluation of the results from microarray studies is needed. Previously we identified the oncogene PLAG1, whose expression is affected by various miRNAs deregulated in CLL. The involvement of miRNAs in PLAG1 expression was shown to be relevant in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland, too. As PLAG1 is highly overexpressed, and its target genes appear to be deregulated in CLL, e.g. BCL-2, PLAG1 is a putative new relevant oncogene involved in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Patz, Michaela', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Patz M', 'Pallasch CP', 'Wendtner CM']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. michaela.patz@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PLAG1 protein, human)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Prognosis']",,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.496016 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Aug;51(8):1379-81. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.496016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, refractory disease remains a problem, and virtually all of even the most sensitive tumors eventually recur. Therefore, ongoing efforts aim at the development of optimized interventional designs that more specifically target the strong pro-survival signature of the transformed B cell. Stimuli from the CLL microenvironment are considered the predominant force that sets this high anti-apoptotic threshold. We introduce here our concept that the oncogene T-cell leukemia 1A (TCL1A), which induces CLL-like disease in transgenic mice, significantly enhances such milieu-derived signaling, propagates associated resistance, and therefore represents a targetable pathway in CLL. We discuss inhibitory strategies that are based on TCL1A's activation of the growth modulating kinase AKT and on influences that regulate TCL1A expression. Respective preliminary data indicate that differential response categories of CLL exist. Future studies will test TCL1A's inherent predictive information.","['Popal, Wagma', 'Boucas, Jorge', 'Peer-Zada, Abdul Ali', 'Herling, Marco']","['Popal W', 'Boucas J', 'Peer-Zada AA', 'Herling M']","['Department of Medicine I, Cologne University, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.505064 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Aug;51(8):1375-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.505064.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic alterations and different stimuli originating from the microenvironment cooperate in the selection and expansion of the malignant clone. Molecular and functional analyses suggest that stimulation through the BCR affects the destiny of leukemic cells in terms of life or death. Microenvironmental signals are crucial for this process, inducing proliferation and leading to the survival and accumulation of leukemic cells within lymphoid organs. Nevertheless, a number of major biological issues still remain to be solved, including the relationships between cell proliferation and cell accumulation within lymphoid organs as well as the mechanisms that regulate CLL cell migration and recirculation between peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. We focused on the role played by the cytoskeleton, given its relevance in controlling cellular shape, mobility, and homing. We hypothesize that hematopoietic cell-specific Lyn substrate 1 (HS1), a putative prognostic marker in CLL that interacts with distinct cytoskeleton adapters in leukemic B-lymphocytes, could regulate the CLL cell cytoskeleton.","['Scielzo, Cristina', 'Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Bertilaccio, Maria T S', 'Muzio, Marta', 'Calissano, Carlo', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico']","['Scielzo C', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Muzio M', 'Calissano C', 'Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Division of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy. scielzo.cristina@hsr.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Shape', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2010/08/07 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/08/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.505061 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Aug;51(8):1371-4. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.505061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative normal T-cell CD4 expression represents a biologic standard and quality control agent. However, low levels of CD4 expression were detected in normal T-cells in Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) samples. METHODS: The QuantiBrite System(R) was used to determine the level of CD4 expression (mean antibody bound per cell, ABC) in fresh and shipped HCL blood and fresh normal donor blood (NDB). The effects of shipping, lysing reagent, cell preparation method, and antibody lot were evaluated. RESULTS: Shipped HCL specimens (n = 69) had a significantly lower mean CD4 ABC of 38,788 (CV = 9.1%) compared to fresh specimens (n = 105) CD4 value of 40,330 (CV = 8.4%) (P < 0.05). In NDB, significant differences were seen for fresh versus shipped specimens using the stain/lyse method but not for lyse/stain method. Consistent differences in CD4 ABC based upon antibody lot were observed in fresh HCL and NDB samples. Stain/lyse and lyse/stain methods using NH(4) Cl lyse were compared in NDB using identical samples and antibodies. The NDB CD4 ABC values obtained with the lyse (NH(4) Cl)/stain method (45,562, 3.7% CV) were lower than those obtained with the stain/lyse (NH(4) Cl) method (49,955, 3.3% CV) with P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: CD4 expression in HCL patient samples is not inherently different from that observed in NDB and therefore may serve as a biological control in clinical QFCM.

Moreover, we demonstrated that the synergistic differentiation-inducing activity of Nutlin-1 combined with ATRA appeared in a p53-independent manner. In the present study, we found that ATRA could selectively induce expression of p-glycoprotein (p-gp) in HL60 and NB4 cells but not in U937 cells. Investigation of p-gp-ATPase activity showed that Nutlin-1 and ATRA were likely to act as p-gp transport substrates. Furthermore, Nutlin-1 enhanced the ability of ATRA to induce expression of the myeloid differentiation-related transcription factor C/EBPbeta and to reduce expression of c-myc. Additionally, the expression of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) was further reduced in cells treated with ATRA in combination with Nutlin-1. Taken together, the mechanisms of synergistic differentiation-inducing activity of Nutlin-1 combined with ATRA could be attributed to Nutlin-1 competitive binding to p-gp, leading to ATRA efflux inhibition, and then the differentiation pathways involved were therefore further activated. Nutlin-1 might be a useful adjuvant with ATRA for patients with retinoid-resistant leukemia induced by overexpression of p-gp.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Yan, Yan', 'Zhu, Difeng', 'Yang, Wei', 'Wang, Weisi', 'Hu, Yongzhou', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Zhang L', 'Yan Y', 'Zhu D', 'Yang W', 'Wang W', 'Hu Y', 'Yang B', 'He Q']","['Institute of Pharmacology & Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, 388# Yuhangtang Rd., Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (nutlin 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9512-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Feb;30(1):37-47. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9512-5.

Because Stat3 is constitutively activated in CLL and sequence analysis revealed that the ROR1 promoter harbors gamma-interferon activation sequence-like elements typically activated by Stat3, we hypothesized that Stat3 activates ROR1. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Because IL-6 induced Stat3 phosphorylation and upregulated Ror1 protein levels in MM1 cells, we used these cells as a model. We transfected MM1 cells with truncated ROR1 promoter luciferase reporter constructs and found that IL-6 induced luciferase activity of ROR1-195 and upstream constructs. Co-transfection with Stat3 siRNA reduced the IL-6-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that IL-6 induced luciferase activity by activating Stat3. EMSA and the ChIP assay confirmed that Stat3 binds ROR1, and EMSA studies identified two Stat3 binding sites. In CLL cells, EMSA and ChIP studies determined that phosphorylated Stat3 bound to the ROR1 promoter at those two ROR1 promoter sites, and ChIP analysis showed that Stat3 co-immunoprecipitated DNA of STAT3, ROR1, and several Stat3-regulated genes. Finally, like STAT3-siRNA in MM1 cells, STAT3-shRNA downregulated STAT3, ROR1, and STAT3-regulated genes and Stat3 and Ror1 protein levels in CLL cells. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that constitutively activated Stat3 binds to the ROR1 promoter and activates ROR1 in CLL cells.","['Li, Ping', 'Harris, David', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Liu, Jie', 'Keating, Michael', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Li P', 'Harris D', 'Liu Z', 'Liu J', 'Keating M', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

L1s can retrotranspose in the germline, during early development and in select somatic cells; however, the host response to L1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored. Here we show that reporter genes introduced into the genome of various human embryonic carcinoma-derived cell lines (ECs) by L1 retrotransposition are rapidly and efficiently silenced either during or immediately after their integration. Treating ECs with histone deacetylase inhibitors rapidly reverses this silencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that reactivation of the reporter gene was correlated with changes in chromatin status at the L1 integration site. Under our assay conditions, rapid silencing was also observed when reporter genes were delivered into ECs by mouse L1s and a zebrafish LINE-2 element, but not when similar reporter genes were delivered into ECs by Moloney murine leukaemia virus or human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting that these integration events are silenced by distinct mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that subjecting ECs to culture conditions that promote differentiation attenuates the silencing of reporter genes delivered by L1 retrotransposition, but that differentiation, in itself, is not sufficient to reactivate previously silenced reporter genes. Thus, our data indicate that ECs differ from many differentiated cells in their ability to silence reporter genes delivered by L1 retrotransposition.","['Garcia-Perez, Jose L', 'Morell, Maria', 'Scheys, Joshua O', 'Kulpa, Deanna A', 'Morell, Santiago', 'Carter, Christoph C', 'Hammer, Gary D', 'Collins, Kathleen L', ""O'Shea, K Sue"", 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Moran, John V']","['Garcia-Perez JL', 'Morell M', 'Scheys JO', 'Kulpa DA', 'Morell S', 'Carter CC', 'Hammer GD', 'Collins KL', ""O'Shea KS"", 'Menendez P', 'Moran JV']","['Department of Human Genetics, 1241 East Catherine Street, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-5618, USA. josel.garcia.perez@juntadeandalucia.es']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK62027/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM08322/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK062027/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 GM060518-12/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-069985/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM082970-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM069985/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM082970/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM060518/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS048187/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM082970/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060518/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI051198/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-048187/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008322/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Retroelements)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'HIV/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Zebrafish/genetics']",PMC3034402,['NIHMS210085'],2010/08/06 06:00,2010/09/25 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2009/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['nature09209 [pii]', '10.1038/nature09209 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Aug 5;466(7307):769-73. doi: 10.1038/nature09209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased expression of CD20 is one of the major mechanisms underlying both innate and acquired resistance to rituximab. In this study, we show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors augment the cytotoxic activity of rituximab by enhancing the surface expression of CD20 antigen on lymphoma cells. HDAC inhibitors, valproic acid (VPA) and romidepsin, increased CD20 expression at protein and mRNA levels in B-cell lymphoma cell lines with relatively low CD20 expression levels. The VPA-mediated increase in CD20 expression occurred at 1 m, which is clinically achievable and safe, but insufficient for inducing cell death. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HDAC inhibitors transactivated the CD20 gene through promoter hyperacetylation and Sp1 recruitment. HDAC inhibitors potentiated the activity of rituximab in complement-dependent cytotoxic assays. In mouse lymphoma models, HDAC inhibitors enhanced CD20 expression along with histone hyperacetylation in transplanted cells, and acted synergistically with rituximab to retard their growth. The combination with HDAC inhibitors may serve as an effective strategy to overcome rituximab resistance in B-cell lymphomas.","['Shimizu, R', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Wada, T', 'Ozawa, K', 'Kano, Y', 'Furukawa, Y']","['Shimizu R', 'Kikuchi J', 'Wada T', 'Ozawa K', 'Kano Y', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010157 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.157 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1760-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.157.

We examined the influence of MLL/AF4 and AML1/MTG8 fusion genes on the expression of TERT coding for the telomerase protein subunit, and subsequently telomerase activity in t(4;11)-positive ALL and t(8;21)-positive cell lines, respectively. MLL/AF4 suppression diminished telomerase activity and expression of TERT. Blocking pro-apoptotic caspase activation in conjunction with MLL/AF4 knockdown enhanced the inhibition of TERT gene expression, which suggests that MLL/AF4 depletion does not reduce TERT expression levels by inducing apoptosis. Knockdown of HOXA7, a direct transcriptional target of MLL/AF4 fusion gene, caused a reduction of telomerase and TERT to an extent similar to that observed with MLL/AF4 suppression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of SEM cells, using ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged Hoxa7, indicates HOXA7 binding site in the TERT promoter region. Furthermore, suppression of the AML1/MTG8 fusion gene was associated with severely reduced clonogenicity, induction of replicative senescence, impaired TERT expression and accelerated telomere shortening. We thus present findings that show a mechanistic link between leukemic fusion proteins, essential for development and maintenance of leukemia, and telomerase, a key element of both normal and malignant self-renewal.","['Gessner, A', 'Thomas, M', 'Castro, P Garrido', 'Buchler, L', 'Scholz, A', 'Brummendorf, T H', 'Soria, N Martinez', 'Vormoor, J', 'Greil, J', 'Heidenreich, O']","['Gessner A', 'Thomas M', 'Castro PG', 'Buchler L', 'Scholz A', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Soria NM', 'Vormoor J', 'Greil J', 'Heidenreich O']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100805,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HOXA7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/11/13 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010155 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.155 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Oct;24(10):1751-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.155.

METHODS: Between May 2002 and April 2005, 63 patients were entered before the study closing early. All received two cycles paclitaxel 200 mg/m and carboplatin area under the curve 6 intravenous plus gefitinib 250 mg daily. Poor risk stratum 1 (> or =5% weight loss and/or performance status 2) received radiotherapy 200 cGy for 33 fractions (6600 cGy) and gefitinib 250 mg daily. Good-risk stratum 2 (performance status: 0-1 weight loss and <5%) received the same RT with gefitinib 250 mg daily and weekly paclitaxel 50 mg/m plus carboplatin AUC 2. Consolidation gefitinib until progression was started after all toxicities were grade < or =2. RESULTS: Acute high-grade infield toxicities were not clearly increased compared with historical CRT data. Poor-risk (N = 21) median progression-free survival was 13.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.4-25.2) and median overall survival 19.0 months (95% CI: 9.9-28.4). Good-risk (N = 39) median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.7-12.2), and median overall survival was 13 months (95% CI: 8.5-17.2). Thirteen of 45 tumors analyzed had activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, and 2 of 13 also had T790M mutations. Seven tumors of 45 had KRAS mutations. There was no apparent survival difference with EGFR-activating mutations versus wild type or KRAS mutation versus wild type. CONCLUSIONS: Survival of poor-risk patients with wild type or mutated EGFR receiving sequential CRT with gefitinib was promising. Survival for good-risk patients receiving concurrent CRT plus gefitinib was disappointing even for tumors with activating EGFR mutations.","['Ready, Neal', 'Janne, Pasi A', 'Bogart, Jeffrey', 'Dipetrillo, Thomas', 'Garst, Jennifer', 'Graziano, Stephen', 'Gu, Lin', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Green, Mark R', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Ready N', 'Janne PA', 'Bogart J', 'Dipetrillo T', 'Garst J', 'Graziano S', 'Gu L', 'Wang X', 'Green MR', 'Vokes EE']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. ready001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Large Cell/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage', '*Radiotherapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181eba657 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)30613-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2010 Sep;5(9):1382-90. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181eba657.,,,,,"['Cancer, Leukemia Group B, Chicago, IL']",,,,,,,,,,,

The simultaneous deletion of all three PAR bZip transcription factors leads to increased morbidity and shortened life span. In the present study, we demonstrate that Dbp/Tef/Hlf triple knockout mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction associated with a low blood pressure. These dysfunctions are exacerbated by an abnormal response to this low blood pressure characterized by low aldosterone levels.

Understanding the role of particular tyrosine kinases in malignancies has allowed for the design of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which can target these enzymes and interfere with downstream signaling. TKIs have proven to be successful in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and other malignancies. Scattered reports have suggested that these agents appear to affect blood glucose (BG). We retrospectively studied the BG concentrations in diabetic (17) and nondiabetic (61) patients treated with dasatinib (8), imatinib (39), sorafenib (23), and sunitinib (30) in our clinical practice. Mean declines of BG were dasatinib (53 mg/dL), imatinib (9 mg/dL), sorafenib (12 mg/dL), and sunitinib (14 mg/dL). All these declines in BG were statistically significant. Of note, 47% (8/17) of the patients with diabetes were able to discontinue their medications, including insulin in some patients. Only one diabetic patient developed symptomatic hypoglycemia while on sunitinib. The mechanism for the hypoglycemic effect of these drugs is unclear, but of the four agents tested, c-kit and PDGFRbeta are the common target kinases. Clinicians should keep the potential hypoglycemic effects of these agents in mind; modification of hypoglycemic agents may be required in diabetic patients.

OBJECTIVE: This case series examined the antineoplastic activity of the bortezomib-based regimens in a small cohort of patients with PCL. CASE SUMMARIES: We describe a retrospective review of the 3 cases of PCL diagnosed at Antonio Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy, between July 2004 and October 2006 (2 women and 1 man, all white, ages 71, 64, and 42 years; 2 with primary PCL and 1 with secondary PCL). These patients were treated with bortezomib variously combined with other drugs outside of clinical trials. Patients 1 and 2 received bortezomib-based regimens (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. once daily on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. once daily on days 1-4 and 8-11; oral cyclophosphamide 50 mg once daily on days 1-21, every 28 days) after 2 previous chemotherapeutic treatments. Patient 3 received a bortezomib-based regimen (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. once daily on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; doxorubicin 9 mg/m2 i.v. once daily on days 1-4; and dexamethasone 40 mg i.v. once daily on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18 during cycle 1 and days 1-4 during subsequent cycles) after one previous chemotherapeutic regimen. In all 3 patients, circulating plasma cells persisted. Patients 1 and 2 were not considered candidates for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) because of their nonresponse to the bortezomib-based regimens and severe deterioration of their clinical conditions (kidney and liver failure) due to disease progression. The overall survivals after administration of the bortezomib- based regimens were 4 months in patient 1 and 1 month in patient 2. After further treatment according to the modified protocol for patients with acute lymphatic leukemia (cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and 200 mg/m2 i.v. on days 2-5; vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 i.v. once daily on days 1, 8, and 15; doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1; methotrexate 1200 mg/m2/h i.v. + 240 mg/m2/h i.v. for 23 hours [modified CODOX-M protocol]) due to the unavailability of a human leukocyte antigen-identical donor, patient 3 received high-dose (200 mg/m2) melphalan with autologous PBSCT, obtaining partial remission lasting 9 months. The patient died 5 months later because of disease progression. CONCLUSION: These 3 patients with primary or secondary PCL who received a bortezomib-based regimen as rescue medication did not respond to treatment.","['Mele, Giuseppe', 'Pinna, Salvatore', 'Melpignano, Angela', 'Quarta, Giovanni']","['Mele G', 'Pinna S', 'Melpignano A', 'Quarta G']","['Clinical Division of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Antonio Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy. giuseppemele2007@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(10)00171-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2010 May;32(5):915-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.05.008.,['Copyright 2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

However, its use is complicated by development of resistance or drug intolerance, prompting dose escalation or a trial of dasatinib or nilotinib, the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the mechanisms of TKI resistance; discusses the tolerability and efficacy of high-dose imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib; and provides background for the rational use of second-line treatment options. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-December 2009) and EMBASE (1993-December 2009) were searched for pertinent English-language publications using search terms that included, but were not limited to, chronic myeloid leukemia, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and clinical trial. Abstracts from American Society of Hematology annual meetings (2005-2009) were also reviewed. There were no prespecified inclusion or exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Major and complete cytogenetic responses (MCyR and CCyR, respectively) to second-line treatment with high-dose (600-800 mg/d PO) imatinib were restricted to CML patients who had achieved a CyR to standard-dose imatinib: >90% of patients without a previous CyR failed to respond. The expected durability of the response to this approach remains unclear. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia occurred in 14%, 39%, and 8%, respectively, of patients receiving high-dose imatinib. In patients who failed first-line treatment with imatinib, dasatinib (70 mg BID PO) was associated with higher rates of CCyR at 2 years compared with imatinib (44% vs 18%, respectively; P = 0.003), as well as higher estimated rates of progression-free survival at 2 years (86% vs 65%; P = 0.001). Dasatinib use was complicated by grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in 57% and 63% of patients, respectively, and pleural effusion in 5%. Nilotinib treatment was effective in patients who were resistant to or unable to tolerate imatinib, with 46% and 58% achieving a CCyR and MCyR, respectively, at 2 years. Nilotinib use was complicated by grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in 28% and 40% of patients, respectively, and QTc-interval prolongation in 1% to 10% of patients. Neither agent was clinically effective in patients with the common T315I mutation. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib and nilotinib were effective and generally well tolerated as second-line treatments for CML patients with a suboptimal response to standard doses of imatinib or imatinib intolerance.","['Stein, Brady', 'Smith, B Douglas']","['Stein B', 'Smith BD']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",PMC4086628,['NIHMS601590'],2010/08/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(10)00166-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2010 May;32(5):804-20. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.05.003.,['Copyright 2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for adverse cardiometabolic traits in a contemporary cohort of pediatric ALL survivors, we recruited 48 off-therapy patients in remission treated with conventional chemotherapy and 26 treated with total body irradiation (TBI)-based hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in this cross-sectional pilot study. At a median age of 15 years (range, 8-21 years), HCT survivors were significantly more likely than non-HCT survivors to manifest multiple cardiometabolic traits, including central adiposity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Overall, 23.1% of HCT survivors met the criteria for metabolic syndrome (>/= 3 traits), compared with 4.2% of non-HCT survivors (P = .02). HCT survivors also had increased C-reactive protein and leptin levels and decreased adiponectin, suggestive of underlying inflammation and increased visceral fat. In multivariate analyses, history of HCT remained associated with >/= 2 traits (odds ratio [OR]. 5.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-17.15) as well as with >/= 3 traits (OR, 16.72; 95% CI, 1.66-168.80). Other risk factors included any cranial radiation exposure and family history of cardiometabolic disease. In summary, pediatric ALL survivors exposed to TBI-based HCT as well as to any cranial radiation may manifest cardiometabolic traits at an early age and should be screened accordingly.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Simmons, Jill H', 'Roth, Christian L', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Hoffmeister, Paul A', 'Sanders, Jean E', 'Friedman, Debra L']","['Chow EJ', 'Simmons JH', 'Roth CL', 'Baker KS', 'Hoffmeister PA', 'Sanders JE', 'Friedman DL']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['UL1 RR024975-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 RR024978/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 RR024977/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR025014/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024975/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR024975/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025014/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025014-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100601,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Leptin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Leptin/blood', 'Metabolic Syndrome/etiology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC2975816,['NIHMS211258'],2010/08/06 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00229-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Dec;16(12):1674-81. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.016.

Patients received intravenous treosulfan, 12 g/m(2)/day (n = 5) or 14 g/m(2)/day (n = 55) on days -6 to -4, and Flu (30 mg/m(2)/day) on days -6 to -2, followed by infusion of marrow (n = 7) or peripheral blood stem cells (n = 53) from HLA-identical siblings (n = 30) or unrelated donors (n = 30).

Prior studies indicate midostaurin affects the function of immune cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages. To understand the effect of midostaurin on human myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), we conducted an ex vivo study using immature DCs differentiated from CD14(+) monocytes and further maturated using lipopolysaccharide. Addition of midostaurin to a culture of starting CD14(+) monocytes markedly and dose-dependently reduced DC recovery. Mature DCs differentiating in the presence of midostaurin had fewer, shorter cell projections than those differentiating in the absence of midostaurin. Changes in morphological features characteristic of apoptotic cells were also evident. Moreover, midostaurin affected DC differentiation and maturation patterns; CD83 expression levels decreased, whereas CD14 and CD80 expressions increased. Additionally, DCs derived in the presence of midostaurin possessed a lower endocytotic capacity and less allostimulatory activity on naive CD4(+)CD45(+)RA(+) T cell proliferation than those derived in its absence, suggesting that midostaurin redirects DC differentiation toward a less mature stage and that this effect is not solely due to its cytotoxicity. Whether this effect underlies immune suppression or tolerance to disease treatments with unwanted immune reactions needs further evaluation.","['Huang, Yu-Chuen', 'Shieh, Hui-Ru', 'Chen, Yu-Jen']","['Huang YC', 'Shieh HR', 'Chen YJ']","['Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100526,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transport Vesicles/drug effects']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(10)00124-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2010.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Sep;24(6):1705-10. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2010.05.015.

These observations show the relatively low toxicity of cord blood-derived CIK cells and, more importantly, the feasibility of this immunotherapy program for patients who could not otherwise benefit from donor lymphocyte infusions.","['Introna, Martino', 'Pievani, Alice', 'Borleri, Gianmaria', 'Capelli, Chiara', 'Algarotti, Alessandra', 'Mico, Caterina', 'Grassi, Anna', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Golay, Josee', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Introna M', 'Pievani A', 'Borleri G', 'Capelli C', 'Algarotti A', 'Mico C', 'Grassi A', 'Oldani E', 'Golay J', 'Rambaldi A']","['USC Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo, Italy. mintrona@ospedaliriuniti.bergamo.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100601,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/cytology/immunology/*transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects/*methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00227-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Nov;16(11):1603-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.015.

The tyrosine kinase receptor KIT is often mutated and activated and thus contributes to malignant growth of MC. Therefore, KIT-targeting drugs are currently tested for their ability to block growth of malignant MC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the effects of the multikinase inhibitor INNO-406 (bafetinib) on primary neoplastic MC, the canine mastocytoma cell line C2, the human MC leukemia cell line HMC-1.1 bearing the KIT mutant V560G, and HMC-1.2 cells harboring KIT V560G and KIT D816V. RESULTS: INNO-406 was found to inhibit proliferation in HMC-1.1 cells (IC(50): 30-40 nM), but not in HMC-1.2 cells or primary neoplastic cells in patients with KIT D816V-positive SM. In canines, growth-inhibitory effects of INNO-406 were seen in C2 cells (IC(50): 50-100 nM) exhibiting a KIT exon 11 internal tandem-duplication and in primary neoplastic MC harboring wild-type exon 11, whereas no effects were seen in MC exhibiting a polymorphism at amino acid 581 in exon 11. INNO-406 was found to block KIT phosphorylation and expression in HMC-1.1 cells and C2 cells, but not in HMC-1.2 cells, whereas Lyn-phosphorylation was blocked by INNO-406 in all types of MC. CONCLUSIONS: In neoplastic MC, the major target of INNO-406 appears to be KIT. Drug responses may depend on the presence and type of KIT mutation. In human MC, the KIT D816V mutant introduces resistance, and in canine mastocytomas, an exon 11 polymorphism may be indicative of resistance against INNO-406.","['Peter, Barbara', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Thaiwong, Tuddow', 'Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, Vilma', 'Willmann, Michael', 'Valent, Peter']","['Peter B', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Blatt K', 'Gleixner KV', 'Pickl WF', 'Thaiwong T', 'Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan V', 'Willmann M', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100526,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'NVW4Z03I9B (bafetinib)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', '*Mast Cells/enzymology/pathology', '*Mastocytosis, Systemic/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Species Specificity']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00200-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Sep;38(9):782-91. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.05.004.

Limitations of the use of stem cells depends on the small number of cells available; this is the reason why UCB can be used only in very low-weight patients. In this study we have evaluated the efficacy of cellular manipulation before transplant and in particular, before thawing the units through the Rubinstein method. METHODS: We have evaluated the results obtained after thawing 40 UCB to be used for as many patients affected by several pathologies (21 ALL, 6 AML, 3 MDS, 2 LNH, 2 histiocytosis, 2 beta-thalassemia, 1 Chediak-Higashi syndrome, 1 Fanconi anemia, 1 Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and 1 Omenn syndrome). RESULTS: After thawing, nucleated cells (NC) mean recovery was 76.81% (SD+/-15.41). The quantity of NC obtained was 124.29x107 (SD+/-43.18) and in only 5 cases the number of NC after the procedure was lower than the requested graft dose. Among the last ones, in two cases only we did not achieve the target after manipulation. The post-manipulation cellular viability was 83.48% (SD+/-10.6). For all the units shipment complied with all the necessary procedures; in fact the temperature never rose above -120 degrees C. CONCLUSION: In our study we highlighted the efficacy of UCB thawing technique, with the same method defined in 1995 at the New York Blood Centre that guarantees an excellent NC recovery and maintains a high level of cell viability.","['Zinno, Francesco', 'Landi, Fabiola', 'Aureli, Viviana', 'Caniglia, Maurizio', 'Pinto, Rita Maria', 'Rana, Ippolita', 'Balduino, Geppina', 'Miele, Massimino Jan', 'Picardi, Alessandra', 'Arcese, William', 'Isacchi, Giancarlo']","['Zinno F', 'Landi F', 'Aureli V', 'Caniglia M', 'Pinto RM', 'Rana I', 'Balduino G', 'Miele MJ', 'Picardi A', 'Arcese W', 'Isacchi G']","['Immunohematology Section, SIMT Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy. francescozinno@virgilio.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100803,England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Blood Preservation/*methods', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1473-0502(10)00110-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transci.2010.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2010 Oct;43(2):173-8. doi: 10.1016/j.transci.2010.07.005.

Imatinib is recognized as gold standard first-line therapy and impressive clinical and cytogenetic responses are obtained in the majority of chronic phase patients treated with this drug. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) tool is used to monitor molecular residual disease, but practical issues are associated to measurement of molecular responses. Several evidences have now proved that molecular responses have prognostic significance: patients who achieve early molecular response are more likely to obtain durable cytogenetic response and to present less rate of disease progression. While some reports indicated that achieving major molecular response (MMR) represents the most important endpoint associated to best outcome, some other reports indicated that achievement of MMR does not improve the greatest clinical benefit brought by complete cytogenetic response. In this review, we discuss on the role of molecular monitoring, the significance of early response and its correlation with outcome, the significance of major and complete molecular response, the emphasized value of a stable molecular response, the early identification of resistance presenting with increased molecular level.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100804,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(10)00170-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2011 Aug;79(2):135-43. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.07.003.

Here we explored the impact of immunophenotypic markers along with NPM1 mutations and clinical features on the outcome of 133 FLT3-ITD negative NK-AML patients. CD34 expression was associated with poorer complete remission (CR) rate, disease-free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS), whereas CD56 expression adversely affected EFS and OS. In contrast, NPM1 mutations correlated with an improved CR rate, DFS, and EFS. Moreover, males experienced shorter DFS and EFS, while older patients (>/=60 years) had shorter EFS. Multivariate analysis of age, gender, NPM1, CD34, and CD56 showed NPM1 mutation was an independent predictor of better CR rate, DFS, and EFS (P<0.001, P=0.003, and P=0.006, respectively). In addition, older age was associated with shorter DFS and EFS (P=0.045 and P=0.028, respectively), and CD56 positivity predicted shorter EFS (P=0.012).

It is rarely considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with tamponade or a large, bloody pericardial effusion. In patients without known cancer, a large, bloody pericardial effusion raises the possibility of tuberculosis, particularly in patients from endemic areas. However, the signs, symptoms and laboratory findings of pericarditis related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia can mimic tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 58-year-old African American-Nigerian woman with a history of travel to Nigeria and a positive tuberculin skin test who presented with cardiac tamponade. She had a mild fever, lymphocytosis and a bloody pericardial effusion, but cultures and stains were negative for acid-fast bacteria. Assessment of blood by flow cytometry and pericardial biopsy by immunohistochemistry revealed CD5 (+) and CD20 (+) lymphocytes in both tissues, demonstrating this to be an unusual manifestation of early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Although most malignancies that involve the pericardium clinically manifest elsewhere before presenting with tamponade, this case illustrates the potential for early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia to present as a large pericardial effusion with tamponade. Moreover, the presentation mimicked tuberculosis. This case also demonstrates that it is possible to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia-related pericardial tamponade by removal of the fluid without chemotherapy.","['Lin, Elaine', 'Boire, Adrienne', 'Hemmige, Vagish', 'Husain, Aliya N', 'Sorrentino, Matthew', 'Nathan, Sandeep', 'Akhter, Shahab A', 'Dickstein, Jerome', 'Archer, Stephen L']","['Lin E', 'Boire A', 'Hemmige V', 'Husain AN', 'Sorrentino M', 'Nathan S', 'Akhter SA', 'Dickstein J', 'Archer SL']","['Section of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. sarcher@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100804,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC2923171,,2010/08/06 06:00,2010/08/06 06:01,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-4-246 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-4-246 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2010 Aug 4;4:246. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-4-246.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These receptors are relatively abundant in the central nervous system and peripheral parasympathetic nervous system. Many cells express a mixture of muscarinic receptor transcripts. Changes in muscarinic M(2) and M(3) receptor mRNA levels in response to agonist treatment have been reported in cerebellar granule cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, lymphocytes and in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the effects of agonist stimulation on cell proliferation and on the levels of muscarinic receptor expression in K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. METHODS: Total RNA and crude membrane fractions were prepared from K562 cells challenged with carbachol (CCh). Muscarinic receptor subtype expression was determined by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Proliferation and cell viability were evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion test and BrDU labeling. RESULTS: We showed that CCh-treatment leads to changes in muscarinic M(2), M(3), and M(4) receptor transcripts as well as M(2) and M(3) protein levels. We also found that CCh decreased proliferation of K562 cells in a time dependent manner, an effect prevented by atropine. These results suggest that CCh modulates K562 chronic myelogenous leukemic cells proliferation through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.","['Cabadak, Hulya', 'Aydin, Banu', 'Kan, Beki']","['Cabadak H', 'Aydin B', 'Kan B']","['Department of Biophysics, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100804,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (Muscarinic Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M2)', '0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M3)', '0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M4)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '7C0697DR9I (Atropine)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Atropine/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CHO Cells', 'Carbachol/*pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Muscarinic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M3/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M4/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,,2010/08/06 06:00,2011/04/07 06:00,['2010/08/06 06:00'],"['2010/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10799893.2010.506484 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2011 Feb;31(1):26-32. doi: 10.3109/10799893.2010.506484.

Activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is proved to be involved in intrinsic apoptotic pathways under various stimuli. However, whether the proapoptotic factor GSK3beta participates in HF-LPLI-induced apoptosis has not been elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the involvement of GSK3beta in apoptosis under HF-LPLI treatment (120 J/cm2, 633 nm). We found that GSK3beta activation could promote HF-LPLI-induced apoptosis, which could be prevented by lithium chloride (a selective inhibitor of GSK3beta) exposure or by GSK3beta-KD (a dominant-negative GSK3beta) overexpression. We also found that the activation of GSK3beta by HF-LPLI was due to the inactivation of protein kinase B (Akt), a widely reported and important upstream negative regulator of GSK3beta, indicating the existence and inactivation of Akt/GSK3beta signaling pathway. Moreover, the inactivation of Akt/GSK3beta pathway depended on the fluence of HF-LPLI treatment. Furthermore, vitamin c, a ROS scavenger, completely prevented the inactivation of Akt/GSK3beta pathway, indicating ROS generation was crucial for the inactivation. In addition, GSK3beta promoted Bax activation by down-regulating Mcl-1 upon HF-LPLI treatment. Taken together, we have identified a new and important proapoptotic signaling pathway that is consisted of Akt/GSK3beta inactivation for HF-LPLI stimulation. Our research will extend the knowledge into the biological mechanisms induced by LPLI.","['Huang, Lei', 'Wu, Shengnan', 'Xing, Da']","['Huang L', 'Wu S', 'Xing D']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Down-Regulation/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', '*Light', '*Low-Level Light Therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Transport/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2010/08/05 06:00,2011/01/29 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22367 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Mar;226(3):588-601. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22367.,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: the area under influence of this incinerator was delimited by a 7 km radius from its geocoded centroid. Deaths of city residents in administrative districts inside this area due to cancer of lung, liver, larynx, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults, leukemia, and all sites combined in children, in the 1998 to 2002 period, were selected and geocoded. The studied area was divided into 7 concentric rings delimited by a radius of 1 to 7 km from the incinerator. The analysis of the relationship between residential proximity to the incinerator and mortality due to cancer was based on the comparison of observed and expected cases, using the Stone test for decline in risk with distance from the incinerator. RESULTS: the area studied comprised 1,599,532 inhabitants, of which 92,894 were children less than 5 years old and 634,993 were adults over 40 years old. No spatial gradient in risk was observed for any outcome in relation to distance from the incinerator. CONCLUSION: although no excess risk for the selected cancers were observed, emissions of incinerators still operating and their possible health effects should be monitored.

In this research, the potential use of an expression vector as a specific siRNA producing tool for silencing of Bcr-abl in K562 cell line has been investigated. METHODS: siRNA specific for Bcr-abl as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was designed and cloned in expression vector (pRNAH1.1/Neo). K562 cells were cultured in RPMI media and transfected with shRNA expressing vector using lipofectamin 2000. Successful transfection was confirmed by significant increase of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) levels in K562-treated cells with expression vector (pEGFP-C1). In vitro studies in human K562 cell line entailed modulation of endogenous Bcr-abl mRNA levels which induced apoptosis. Effects of siRNA treatment on K562 cells were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Successful expression of siRNA was confirmed by significant reduction of Bcr-abl mRNA levels in K562 cells treated with expression vector (pRNAH1.1/Neo). siRNA directed against Bcr-abl effectively induced apoptosis and reduced viability in human K562 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Expression vector of siRNA can be used in vitro to target specific RNA and to reduce the levels of the specific gene product in the targeted cells. Results of this work suggest that RNAi has potential application for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including those involving abnormal gene expression and viral contamination.","['Zaree Mahmodabady, Ali', 'Javadi, Hamid Reza', 'Kamali, Mehdi', 'Najafi, Ali', 'Hojati, Zahra']","['Zaree Mahmodabady A', 'Javadi HR', 'Kamali M', 'Najafi A', 'Hojati Z']","['Dept. of Biochemistry, Baqiyatallah University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Transfection']",PMC3878140,,2010/08/05 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2010 Jan-Apr;14(1-2):1-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the mutation analysis of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes was performed in 87 pediatric T-ALLs who were treated on the ALL-BFM protocols. In 19 patients (22%), activating NOTCH1 mutations were observed either in the heterodimerization domain or in the PEST domain and 7 cases (10%) demonstrated FBXW7 mutations (2 cases had both NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations). We also analyzed the relationship of the mutation data between the clinical and biological data of the patients. NOTCH1 and FBXW7, NOTCH1 alone were found correlated with lower initial leucocyte counts which was independent from the sex and T- cell immunophenotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro/in vivo models of endothelial cells cultures, Matrigel plug assay, tumor-bearing nude mice, and murine leukemia cells-inoculated mice were utilized to evaluate BPR0L075 for antiangiogenic and antitumoral activity spectra. RESULTS: BPR0L075 concentration-dependently inhibited proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), disrupted capillary tube formations of HUVECs and rat aorta endothelial cells, and suppressed in vivo VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs in mice. Besides inhibiting the colony growth of cancer cells, BPR0L075 suppressed growth of subcutaneously-xenografted human lung, colorectal, and cervical solid tumors in nude mice. Combination treatments of BPR0L075 plus cisplatin, compared to either agent alone, demonstrated a stronger growth inhibition against the tumor xenografts in nude mice and longer lifespan in the leukemia mice. CONCLUSION: BPR0L075 is an antitumoral and antiangiogenic agent and potentiates the anticancer activity of cisplatin.","['Chen, Ching-Ping', 'Hu, Chih-Bo', 'Yeh, Kai-Chia', 'Song, Jen-Shin', 'Yeh, Teng-Kuang', 'Tung, Fei-Feng', 'Hwang, Ling-Ling', 'Tseng, Huan-Yi', 'Huang, Yu-Chen', 'Shy, Horng-Shing', 'Hsieh, Su-Huei', 'Shen, Chien-Chang', 'Wang, Hsin-Sheng', 'Hsieh, Hsing-Pang', 'Liou, Jing-Ping', 'Chao, Yu-Sheng', 'Chen, Chiung-Tong']","['Chen CP', 'Hu CB', 'Yeh KC', 'Song JS', 'Yeh TK', 'Tung FF', 'Hwang LL', 'Tseng HY', 'Huang YC', 'Shy HS', 'Hsieh SH', 'Shen CC', 'Wang HS', 'Hsieh HP', 'Liou JP', 'Chao YS', 'Chen CT']","['Division of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, National Health Research Institutes, 35 Keyan Road, Zhunan, Miaoli 35053, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"[""0 (6-methoxy-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzoyl)-1H-indole)"", '0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2010/08/05 06:00,2010/08/31 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['30/7/2813 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Jul;30(7):2813-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination boosting MiHA-specific T-cell immunity is an appealing strategy to prevent or counteract tumor recurrence, but improvement is necessary to increase the clinical benefit. Here, we investigated whether knockdown of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 on monocyte-derived DCs results in improved T-cell activation. Electroporation of single siRNA sequences into immature DCs resulted in efficient, specific, and long-lasting knockdown of PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. PD-L knockdown DCs strongly augmented interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 production by stimulated T cells in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, whereas no effect was observed on T-cell proliferation. Moreover, we demonstrated that PD-L gene silencing, especially combined PD-L1 and PD-L2 knockdown, resulted in improved proliferation and cytokine production of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific CD4(+) T cells. Most importantly, PD-L knockdown DCs showed superior potential to expand MiHA-specific CD8(+) effector and memory T cells from leukemia patients early after donor lymphocyte infusion and later during relapse. These data demonstrate that PD-L siRNA electroporated DCs are highly effective in enhancing T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, and are therefore attractive cells for improving the efficacy of DC vaccines in cancer patients.","['Hobo, Willemijn', 'Maas, Frans', 'Adisty, Niken', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'van der Voort, Robbert', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Hobo W', 'Maas F', 'Adisty N', 'de Witte T', 'Schaap N', 'van der Voort R', 'Dolstra H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine-Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University NijmegenMedical Center, Nijmegen Center for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100803,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics/immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein']",,,2010/08/05 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31005-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-278739 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4501-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-278739.

In those malignancies with aberrant CDK activation, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) pathway is deregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Constitutive activation of TRKs is instead linked to cancer cell survival and dissemination. Here, we show that the novel small-molecule PHA-848125, a potent dual inhibitor of CDKs and TRKs, possesses significant antitumor activity. The compound inhibits cell proliferation of a wide panel of tumoral cell lines with submicromolar IC(50). PHA-848125-treated cells show cell cycle arrest in G(1) and reduced DNA synthesis, accompanied by inhibition of pRb phosphorylation and modulation of other CDK-dependent markers. The compound additionally inhibits phosphorylation of TRKA and its substrates in cells, which functionally express this receptor. Following oral administration, PHA-848125 has significant antitumor activity in various human xenografts and carcinogen-induced tumors as well as in disseminated primary leukemia models, with plasma concentrations in rodents in the same range as those found active in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Mechanism of action was also confirmed in vivo as assessed in tumor biopsies from treated mice. These results show that the dual CDK-TRK inhibitor PHA-848125 has the potential for being a novel and efficacious targeted drug for cancer treatment.","['Albanese, Clara', 'Alzani, Rachele', 'Amboldi, Nadia', 'Avanzi, Nilla', 'Ballinari, Dario', 'Brasca, Maria Gabriella', 'Festuccia, Claudio', 'Fiorentini, Francesco', 'Locatelli, Giuseppe', 'Pastori, Wilma', 'Patton, Veronica', 'Roletto, Fulvia', 'Colotta, Francesco', 'Galvani, Arturo', 'Isacchi, Antonella', 'Moll, Jurgen', 'Pesenti, Enrico', 'Mercurio, Ciro', 'Ciomei, Marina']","['Albanese C', 'Alzani R', 'Amboldi N', 'Avanzi N', 'Ballinari D', 'Brasca MG', 'Festuccia C', 'Fiorentini F', 'Locatelli G', 'Pastori W', 'Patton V', 'Roletto F', 'Colotta F', 'Galvani A', 'Isacchi A', 'Moll J', 'Pesenti E', 'Mercurio C', 'Ciomei M']","['Cell Biology Department, BU Oncology, Nerviano Medical Sciences, v.le Pasteur 10, Nerviano, Milan 20014, Italy.

Much is known about the safety profile of lenalidomide from experience in other hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. In addition to the known adverse effects associated with lenalidomide (e.g., myelosuppression, rash, fatigue), some unique effects (e.g., tumor flare reactions, tumor lysis syndrome) have arisen during clinical studies of CLL. Typical signs of tumor flare reactions include early onset of painful enlargement of the lymph nodes or spleen, with or without low-grade fever, rash, and bone pain. Management may require nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a short course of corticosteroids. Dose delays or reductions usually are not required for tumor flare reactions. Signs of tumor lysis syndrome may include shortness of breath, peripheral edema, generalized weakness, sweating, fever, and tachycardia. Untreated tumor lysis syndrome can result in renal impairment and congestive heart failure. Careful monitoring and appropriate management of treatment-related side effects can help ensure that patients with CLL achieve maximum therapeutic benefit from lenalidomide therapy.","['Miller, Kena C', 'Musial, Laurie', 'Whitworth, Amy', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher']","['Miller KC', 'Musial L', 'Whitworth A', 'Chanan-Khan A']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. kena.miller@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin J Oncol Nurs,Clinical journal of oncology nursing,9705336,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/nursing', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,2010/08/05 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['PH10R84W08332413 [pii]', '10.1188/10.CJON.491-499 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2010 Aug;14(4):491-9. doi: 10.1188/10.CJON.491-499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a 36-year-old male with an initial diagnosis of CML and resistance to imatinib mesylate. Chromosome analysis showed an inversion within the long arm of both homologues of chromosome 3 and an interstitial deletion within the long arm of one chromosome 7. The rearrangement of EVI1 locus on both homologues of chromosome 3 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additional FISH studies showed a cryptic insertion of ABL1 into the BCR region, and subsequent duplication of the derivative chromosome 22. The single-nucleotide polymorphism array showed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3 and 22, suggesting that a somatic repair mechanism is involved in the evolution of these genetic alterations.

Notably, siRNA-mediated depletion of any of the subunits of MRN complex led to complete ablation of other subunits of the complex. Treatment of leukemia and prostate cancer cells with etoposide lead to increased expression of MRN complex subunits, with concomitant decrease in the levels of telomerase activity, compared to breast cancer cells.

Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. The survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased, cell growth was slowed down, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. HL-60 cells exhibited typical apoptotic characteristic. Lycorine can suppress leukemia growth and reduce cell survival and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the mechanism by which lycorine induces APL cells. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were treated with different concentration of lycorine, the expression of p21 and TNF-alpha was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Lycorine also down-regulated p21-related gene expression, including Cdc2, Cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cyclin E, promoted Bid truncation, decreased IkappaB phosphorylation and blocked NF-kappaB nuclear import. Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria as observed with confocal laser microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-alpha signal transduction pathway and p21-mediated cell-cycle inhibition were involved in the apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by lycorine. These results contribute to the development of new lycorine-based anti-leukemia drugs.","['Liu, Jing', 'Hu, Ji-Liang', 'Shi, Bi-Wei', 'He, Yan', 'Hu, Wei-Xin']","['Liu J', 'Hu JL', 'Shi BW', 'He Y', 'Hu WX']","[""Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, People's Republic of China."", ""Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, People's Republic of China."", ""Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, People's Republic of China."", ""Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, People's Republic of China."", ""Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, 110 Xiangya Road, Changsha, Hunan 410078, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100804,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC2924328,,2010/08/05 06:00,2010/08/05 06:01,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/05 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-10-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-10-25 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2010 Aug 4;10:25. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-10-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For successful engraftment and re-establishment of hematopoiesis to occur in the recipient, the transplanted HSCs must first migrate from the blood circulation to the bone marrow (BM), a process known as homing, then localize and anchor in suitable microenvironments within the BM, a process known as lodgment. After lodgment, the specific fate of the transplanted HSCs is determined through complex, bidirectional interactions with various stromal cell components in the niche. Ultimately, these interactions dictate the clinical outcome of the transplantation. Through the use of transgenic mouse models, considerable evidence has been accumulated in an attempt to unveil the possible underlying mechanisms that govern these processes.

Specifically, we will first introduce early observations on the spatial distribution of hematopoietic progenitors within the BM, then we will discuss the soluble factors, chemokines, cell-cell interactions, and cell-matrix interactions that have been studied and known to influence the site of HSC lodgment within the BM following transplantation.","['Lam, B S', 'Adams, Gregor B']","['Lam BS', 'Adams GB']","['Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, CXCR4/physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology']",,,2010/08/05 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1250 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01250.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Dec;32(6 Pt 2):551-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01250.x.,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the importance of such an emergency regarding microchimerism (i.e. mixed chimerism below 1% of autologous cells) still remains controversial, as fluctuating microchimerism can be observed for a very long time after transplantation. METHODS: Using real-time PCR (RQ-PCR), we compare peripheral blood samples obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) before hematological relapse and those taken during complete remission (i.e. either complete cytogenetic remission or complete molecular remission where applicable). By comparison of these two groups, we describe microchimerism dynamics clearly connected with imminent AML relapse. Additionally, we compare applicability of RQ-PCR and conventional PCR with fragment analysis. RESULTS: Mere reappearance of autologous hematopoiesis within patients with complete donor chimerism is alarming, and another sample with further increase confirms ongoing relapse. In case of patients with continuous microchimerism, another two consecutive samples with increasing trend are required. RQ-PCR predicted a significantly higher number of hematological relapses (87%vs. 39%) with a median anticipation period of 33 days, 26 days earlier than conventional PCR (P= 0.0002). Moreover, the outcome of microchimerism dynamics was in complete agreement with monitoring of minimal residual disease when analyzed from the same cell compartment. CONCLUSION: Within this paper, we emphasize the importance of microchimerism monitoring as a reliable indicator of incipient AML relapse, especially in patients where no other specific molecular marker is available.","['Horky, O', 'Mayer, J', 'Kablaskova, L', 'Razga, F', 'Krejci, M', 'Kissova, J', 'Borsky, M', 'Jeziskova, I', 'Dvorakova, D']","['Horky O', 'Mayer J', 'Kablaskova L', 'Razga F', 'Krejci M', 'Kissova J', 'Borsky M', 'Jeziskova I', 'Dvorakova D']","['Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematooncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni 9, Brno, Czech Republic. ohorky@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Testing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/08/05 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1249 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01249.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Feb;33(1):57-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01249.x.,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multi-center, retrospective study, we analyzed proportion, rate per 1,000 person-days at risk, and cumulative risk of bacteremias and IFD in children with AML. RESULTS: Between January 1998 and December 2005, 240 children were treated for AML at 8 Italian Centers, for a total of 521 treatment courses and 63,232 person-days at risk. Bacteremia was observed in 32% of treatment courses and IFD was seen in 10% (P < 0.0001), with rates of 2.62 and 0.84, respectively (P < 0.001). There was a significantly higher frequency of IFD during relapse treatment: proportion 15% versus 9% (P = 0.05), rate 2.10 versus 0.64 (P = 0.008) and cumulative risk 32% versus 12% (P = 0.007), while there were no differences in the proportion, rate and cumulative risk of bacteremia during front-line or relapse treatment. The epidemiology of bacteremias and IFD was different during front-line therapy for M3 as compared to other types of AML, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Severe infectious complications are frequent during the treatment of pediatric AML, especially during relapse treatment, and bacteremias are more frequent than IFD.","['Castagnola, Elio', 'Rossi, Mario R', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Livadiotti, Susanna', 'Giacchino, Mareva', 'Zanazzo, Giulio', 'Fioredda, Francesca', 'Beretta, Chiara', 'Ciocchello, Francesca', 'Carli, Modesto', 'Putti, Maria Caterina', 'Pansini, Valeria', 'Berger, Massimo', 'Licciardello, Maria', 'Farina, Silvia', 'Caviglia, Ilaria', 'Haupt, Riccardo']","['Castagnola E', 'Rossi MR', 'Cesaro S', 'Livadiotti S', 'Giacchino M', 'Zanazzo G', 'Fioredda F', 'Beretta C', 'Ciocchello F', 'Carli M', 'Putti MC', 'Pansini V', 'Berger M', 'Licciardello M', 'Farina S', 'Caviglia I', 'Haupt R']","[""Department Of Hematology and Oncology, G.

There remains a need for therapeutic improvement for patients refractory to revascularization and those who redevelop occlusions following revascularization. Early evidence linked age-associated reductions in the levels of circulating marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), characterized by expression of early HSC markers CD133 and CD34, with the occurrence of cardiovascular events and associated death. Heart tissue has the endogenous ability to regenerate through the activation of resident cardiac stem cells or through recruitment of a stem cell population from other tissues, such as bone marrow. A number of clinical trials have utilized patient-derived autologous bone marrow-derived cells or whole BM uncultured mononuclear cells (MNC) infused or injected locally to augment angiogenesis. In most cases of treating animal models with human cells, the frequency of stem cell engraftment, the subsequent number of newly generated cardiomyocytes and vascular cells, and the augmentation of endogenous microvascular collateralization, either by deposition, transdifferentiation, and/or by cell fusion, appear to be too low to explain the significant cardiac improvement. Initially, it was hypothesized that cell therapy may work by cell replacement mechanisms, but recent evidence suggests alternatively that cell therapy works by providing trophic support to the injured tissues. An alternative hypothesis is that the transplanted stem cells release soluble cytokines and growth factors (i.e., paracrine factors) that function in a paracrine fashion, contributing to cardiac repair and regeneration by inducing cytoprotection and neovascularization. Another hypothesis which may also be operative is that cell therapy may mediate endogenous regeneration by the activation of resident cardiac stem cell. Well-established clinical trials have used cord blood for the treatment of hematological malignances (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma) and nonmalignancies (e.g., in born errors of metabolism, sickle cells anemia, autoimmune diseases), but further advances in other areas of regenerative medicine (e.g., cardiac repair) will directly benefit with the use of cord blood. These clinical outcomes demonstrate that effector cells may be delivered by an allogeneic approach, where strict tissue matching may not be necessary and treatment may be achieved by making use of the trophic support capability of cell therapy and not by a cell replacement mechanism.","['Greco, Nicholas', 'Laughlin, Mary J']","['Greco N', 'Laughlin MJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA. ngreco@clevelandcordblood.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', 'Myocardial Infarction/*therapy', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology']",,,2010/08/04 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/08/04 06:00'],"['2010/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-705-1_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;660:29-52. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-705-1_3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-three patients received disease-adapted chemotherapy, with a response rate of 73%, while 14 received no interventions due to an indolent course, such as MDS. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 1.9 years (range 0.1-10.5) after the diagnosis of t-MDS/AL, and the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 55%. Twenty-seven patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), and the 3-year non-relapse mortality was 17%. Twenty patients did not undergo HCT due to various reasons including advanced age or comorbidities. The 3-year OS was better in patients who received HCT than in those who did not (71 vs. 31%; p = 0.018). A multivariate analysis revealed that HCT was associated with a better OS.

METHODS: A telephone survey was carried out of all 21 haematology-oncology (HO) centres and seven bone marrow transplant (BMT) units within the UK Children's Cancer Study Group focusing on key audit themes of: availability of evidence-based guidelines, oral and dental care prior to and during cancer treatment, oral assessment, prevention and treatment of oral complications. RESULTS: The national guidelines were used in 19/25 (76%) settings that employed written guidelines. There was little variation in advice given to patients/parents on basic oral hygiene, and this advice was commensurate with guideline recommendations. Inconsistencies in oral care assessment, reported at baseline, remained commonplace across the majority of settings. In only 10/21 HO centres, it was usual practice for children to undergo dental assessment prior to commencing cancer treatment, indicating no improvement since baseline survey. Few therapies outside of the guideline recommendations were being used. The routine use of preventive nystatin, not recommended in the guideline, had significantly decreased from baseline (by 40%). CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of national guidelines by HO/BMT settings was good however certain oral care practices fell short of the guideline recommendations. Routine dental checks need to be embedded in practice. Further consideration is needed as to how oral assessment might be used more effectively in informing treatment.","['Craig, Jean V', 'Gibson, Faith', 'Glenny, Anne-Marie']","['Craig JV', 'Gibson F', 'Glenny AM']","['School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK.

Serial molecular studies demonstrate decreases in BCR-ABL transcripts over time. Analyses of event-free survival (EFS) and time to progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis (AP/BC) at 7 years were based on molecular responses using the international scale (IS) at 6-, 12-, and 18-month landmarks. Patients with BCR-ABL transcripts > 10% at 6 months and > 1% at 12 months had inferior EFS and higher rate of progression to AP/BC compared with all other molecular response groups. Conversely, patients who achieved major molecular response [MMR: BCR-ABL (IS) </= 0.1%] by 18 months enjoyed remarkably durable responses, with no progression to AP/BC and 95% EFS at 7 years.

We hypothesized that comprehensive profiling of C&Ckine expression in leukemia would provide greater insight compared with individual analyses. We used multiplex array technology to simultaneously measure the level of 27 C&Ckines in serum from 176 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 114 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and 19 normal controls. C&Ckine levels in AML and MDS differed significantly from normal controls (5 higher, 13 lower) but were similar to each other for 24 of 27 analytes, with interleukin-8 and interleukin-13 higher in AML and vascular endothelial growth factor A higher in MDS. Levels did not correlate with age, gender, infection, or blood counts; however, 3 correlated with specific cytognetic abnormalities in AML. Individually, few cytokines had any correlation with response or survival. In newly diagnosed AML, 8 C&Ckine signatures, distinct from the normal control signature, were observed. These signatures had prognostic impact, affecting remission, primary resistance, relapse rates, and overall survival, individually (P = .003) and in multivariable analysis (P = .004). These patterns suggest specific therapeutic interventions to investigate in subsets of AML patients. In conclusion, C&Ckine expression in AML and MDS differs from normal, is similar with one another, and forms recurrent patterns of expression with prognostic relevance.","['Kornblau, Steven M', 'McCue, David', 'Singh, Neera', 'Chen, Wenjing', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Coombes, Kevin R']","['Kornblau SM', 'McCue D', 'Singh N', 'Chen W', 'Estrov Z', 'Coombes KR']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

ICSBP acts as a suppressor of myeloid leukemia, although few target genes explaining this effect have been identified. In the current studies, we identified the gene encoding growth arrest specific 2 (GAS2) as an ICSBP target gene relevant to leukemia suppression. We find that ICSBP, Tel, and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) bind to a cis element in the GAS2 promoter and repress transcription in myeloid progenitor cells. Gas2 inhibits calpain protease activity, and beta-catenin is a calpain substrate in these cells. Consistent with this, ICSBP decreases beta-catenin protein and activity in a Gas2- and calpain-dependent manner. Conversely, decreased ICSBP expression increases beta-catenin protein and activity by the same mechanism. This is of interest, because decreased ICSBP expression and increased beta-catenin activity are associated with poor prognosis and blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We find that the expression of Bcr/abl (the CML oncoprotein) increases Gas2 expression in an ICSBP-dependent manner. This results in decreased calpain activity and a consequent increase in beta-catenin activity in Bcr/abl-positive (Bcr/abl(+)) cells. Therefore, these studies have identified a Gas2/calpain-dependent mechanism by which ICSBP influences beta-catenin activity in myeloid leukemia.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Saberwal, Gurveen', 'Konieczna, Iwona', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Zhou W', 'Saberwal G', 'Konieczna I', 'Horvath E', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

Understanding cell type-specific interplay of signaling pathways and oncogenes is essential for developing targeted cancer therapies. Here, we address the vexing issue of how developmental restriction is achieved in Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL), characterized by the triad of fetal origin, mutated GATA1 (GATA1s), and trisomy 21. We demonstrate overactivity of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in authentic human DS-AMKL and in a DS-AMKL mouse model generated through retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Fetal but not adult megakaryocytic progenitors are dependent on this pathway. GATA1 restricts IGF-mediated activation of the E2F transcription network to coordinate proliferation and differentiation. Failure of a direct GATA1-E2F interaction in mutated GATA1s converges with overactive IGF signaling to promote cellular transformation of DS fetal progenitors, revealing a complex, fetal stage-specific regulatory network. Our study underscores context-dependent requirements during oncogenesis, and explains resistance to transformation of ostensibly similar adult progenitors.","['Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Godinho, Frank J', 'Heitmann, Kirsten', 'Maroz, Aliaksandra', 'Koch, Mia Lee', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Li, Zhe']","['Klusmann JH', 'Godinho FJ', 'Heitmann K', 'Maroz A', 'Koch ML', 'Reinhardt D', 'Orkin SH', 'Li Z']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 HL032259/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/physiopathology', 'E2F Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Fetus', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology', '*Megakaryocyte Progenitor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Somatomedins/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor DP1/genetics']",PMC2912563,,2010/08/04 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2010/08/04 06:00'],"['2010/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['24/15/1659 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1903410 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Aug 1;24(15):1659-72. doi: 10.1101/gad.1903410.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abundant expression of these enzymes is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, protease inhibitors that repress cell surface proteases may be applicable to cancer therapy. Because soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor has been found to induce apoptotic death of human leukemia Jurkat cells, anti-leukemia activity of Bungarus multicinctus protease inhibitor-like protein-1 (PILP-1) is thus examined. PILP-1 induced apoptosis of human leukemia U937 cells, characteristic of loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, degradation of procaspase-8, and production of t-Bid. FADD down-regulation neither restored viability of PILP-1-treated cells nor attenuated production of active caspase-8 and t-Bid in PILP-1-treated cells, suggesting that the death receptor-mediated pathway was not involved in the cytotoxicity of PILP-1. It was found that PILP-1-evoked p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation led to PILP-1-induced cell death and down-regulation of ADAM17. Knockdown of ADAM17 by siRNA induced death of U937 cells and inactivation of Lyn and Akt. Immunoprecipitation suggested that ADAM17 and Lyn form complexes. Overexpression of ADAM17, LynY507F (gain of function), and constitutively active Akt suppressed the cytotoxic effects of PILP-1. PILP-1-elicited inactivation of Lyn and Akt was abrogated in cells with overexpressed ADAM17 or LynY507F. Taken together, our data indicate that ADAM17-mediated activation of Lyn/Akt maintains the viability of U937 cells and that suppression of the pathway is responsible for PILP-1-induced apoptosis.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['From the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University-Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100802,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bungarotoxins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bungarotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Multienzyme Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC2945544,,2010/08/04 06:00,2010/10/27 06:00,['2010/08/04 06:00'],"['2010/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)88941-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.156257 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Oct 1;285(40):30506-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.156257.

Immunophenotyping results using Ephesia were fully consistent with those obtained by flow cytometry. We obtained in situ high resolution confocal three-dimensional images of the cell nuclei, showing intranuclear details consistent with conventional cytological staining. Ephesia thus provides a powerful approach to cell capture and typing allowing fully automated high resolution and quantitative immunophenotyping and morphological analysis.

Despite that in both loading methods, the encapsulated counter ion was 5-sulfosalicylate (5ssa), the resultant formulations exhibited distinct properties. In NaCl-containing release buffer, vesicles prepared with nigericin/Na(+) system could release topotecan at a faster rate than 5ssa-TA vesicles, whereas in the absence of Na(+), there was no difference in the drug release kinetics. In plasma, both formulations could prolong the circulation halftime of topotecan, but 5ssa-TA vesicles were more able to stabilize the encapsulated topotecan, as evidenced by the increased t(1/2) and decreased conversion of lactone to carboxylate form. However, the improved drug retention did not mean the elevated safety and efficacy. In L1210 ascitic tumor model, the administration of 5ssa-TA vesicles at 10mg/kg induced the early death of approximately 60% mice at 6-7 days. In contrast, the treatment with nigericin/Na(+) vesicles at the same dose level resulted in a mean survival time of approximately 18.0 days, approximately 1.38-fold of that of free topotecan. In addition, the formulation was safer than free topotecan. The results indicated that nigericin could be used as release regulator to optimize drug release kinetics, resulting in safe and efficacious liposome-based topotecan formulation.

However, the number and combination of gene mutated in myeloid malignancies is still a matter of investigation. METHODS: We searched for mutations in the ASXL1, CBL, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KRAS, NPM1, NRAS, RUNX1, TET2 and WT1 genes in 65 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and 64 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) without balanced translocation or complex karyotype. RESULTS: Mutations in ASXL1 and CBL were frequent in refractory anemia with excess of blasts. Mutations in TET2 occurred with similar frequency in MDSs and AMLs and associated equally with either ASXL1 or NPM1 mutations. Mutations of RUNX1 were mutually exclusive with TET2 and combined with ASXL1 but not with NPM1. Mutations in FLT3 (mutation and internal tandem duplication), IDH1, IDH2, NPM1 and WT1 occurred primarily in AMLs. CONCLUSION: Only 14% MDSs but half AMLs had at least two mutations in the genes studied. Based on the observed combinations and exclusions we classified the 12 genes into four classes and propose a highly speculative model that at least a mutation in one of each class is necessary for developing AML with simple or normal karyotype.","['Rocquain, Julien', 'Carbuccia, Nadine', 'Trouplin, Virginie', 'Raynaud, Stephane', 'Murati, Anne', 'Nezri, Meyer', 'Tadrist, Zoulika', 'Olschwang, Sylviane', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle']","['Rocquain J', 'Carbuccia N', 'Trouplin V', 'Raynaud S', 'Murati A', 'Nezri M', 'Tadrist Z', 'Olschwang S', 'Vey N', 'Birnbaum D', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Mozziconacci MJ']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, UMR891 Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100802,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Here, the contribution of the last decade of advanced genomic research on the clinical management of childhood ALL is examined. The application of genomics for routine diagnosis of ALL is feasible but depends on commercial development of appropriate certified platforms. The discovery of several novel high-risk markers, such as deletions in IKZF1 might be integrated into clinical protocols in the near future. Several novel targets for therapy have been identified and have led to phase I/II therapeutic trials.

Specifically, the effects of human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF), two types of feeders, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and bovine embryonic fibroblast (BEF), as well as three different enzymatic treatments including Trypsin-EDTA, TrypLE, and Liberase Blendzymes 3 were investigated. The addition of hLIF at 1000 U/mL to the culture medium (41.2 and 36.9%), and the use of either MEF or BEF feeders (40.3 and 38.1%) had no significant effect on the ability of inner cell masses (ICMs) to form primary cell colonies compared to controls. All bESC-like cells were first dissociated mechanically for three passages followed by enzymatic dissociation. The ability to maintain ESC morphology to passage 10 was compared among the three enzymes above. More bESC-like cell lines survived beyond passage 10 when treated with TrypLE compared to Trypson-EDTA (28.8 and 12.6%; p < 0.05), and bESC-like cells differentiated quickly when treated with Liberase Blendzyme 3. The bESC-like cells generated in our study displayed typical stem cell morphology and expressed specific markers such as SSEA-1, AP, OCT-4, and Nanog. When removed from feeders, these bESC-like cells formed embryoid bodies (EBs) in a suspension culture. When EBs were cultured on tissue culture plates, they differentiated into various cell types. In summary, we were able to culture bESC-like cells more than 10 passages by enzymatic dissociation, which is important in gene targeting, maintenance, and banking of bESC lines.","['Gong, Guochun', 'Roach, Marsha L', 'Jiang, Le', 'Yang, Xiangzhong', 'Tian, Xiuchun Cindy']","['Gong G', 'Roach ML', 'Jiang L', 'Yang X', 'Tian XC']","['Department of Animal Science and Center for Regenerative Biology, University of Connecticut , Storrs, CT 06269-4243, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Reprogram,Cellular reprogramming,101528176,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Embryo Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",,,2010/08/04 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/08/04 06:00'],"['2010/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cell.2009.0049 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Reprogram. 2010 Apr;12(2):151-60. doi: 10.1089/cell.2009.0049.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of serum sVEGF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 20 children with acute leukemia, 33 children with different histopathological subtypes of ML, and 20 healthy controls. The levels of sVEGF at diagnosis (range 2 -1040 pg/mL; median 52 pg/mL) was significantly lower than in remission (range 136 -1960 pg/mL; median 630 pg/mL) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) group (P = .018).

MLL plant homeodomain 3 (PHD3) is lost in all MLL translocation products, and reinsertion of PHD3 into MLL fusion proteins abrogates their transforming activity. PHD3 has been shown to interact with the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain of human nuclear Cyclophilin33 (CYP33). Here, we show that CYP33 mediates downregulation of the expression of MLL target genes HOXC8, HOXA9, CDKN1B, and C-MYC, in a proline isomerase-dependent manner. This downregulation correlates with the reduction of trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and histone H3 acetylation. We have structurally characterized both the PHD3 and CYP33 RRM domains and analyzed their binding to one another. The PHD3 domain binds H3K4me3 (preferentially) and the CYP33 RRM domain at distinct sites. Our binding data show that binding of H3K4me3 to PHD3 and binding of the CYP33 RRM domain to PHD3 are mutually inhibitory, implying that PHD3 is a molecular switch for the transition between activation and repression of target genes. To explore the possible mechanism of CYP33/PHD3-mediated repression, we have analyzed the CYP33 proline isomerase activity on various H3 and H4 peptides and shown selectivity for two sites in H3. Our results provide a possible mechanism for the MLL PHD3 domain to act as a switch between activation and repression.","['Park, Sangho', 'Osmers, Ute', 'Raman, Gayathree', 'Schwantes, Rebecca H', 'Diaz, Manuel O', 'Bushweller, John H']","['Park S', 'Osmers U', 'Raman G', 'Schwantes RH', 'Diaz MO', 'Bushweller JH']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA105049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (PPIE protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cyclophilins/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*physiology', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC2916634,,2010/08/04 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/08/04 06:00'],"['2010/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi1009387 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2010 Aug 10;49(31):6576-86. doi: 10.1021/bi1009387.,,,,,,,,,,,"['PDB/2KYU', 'PDB/2KYX']",,,,,

RESULTS: All six of the commercial layer chickens examined showed hemangiomas on their body surface or feet. Some developed hemangiomas in their internal organs, causing hepatorrhexis and blood loss. Histopathologically different stages of hemangiomas with ML in the liver, heart, and spleen, were observed. Five viral isolates were obtained from infected DF1 cells incubated with the spleen tissue or serum of the birds from the six flocks. By full genome sequences analysis, a 19-nucleotide repeat sequence was identified in the primer binding site (PBS)-leader region of isolates JS09GY3 and JS09GY6, located between sites 249 and 250 according to the sequence of reference strain HPRS103, and also present in Rous sarcoma virus strain Schmidt-Ruppin B (RSV-SRB), Rous associated virus type 1 (RAV-1), and Rous associated virus type 2 (RAV-2). The predicted Gp85 proteins of isolates JS09GY2, JS09GY3, JS09GY5, and JS09GY6 were highly variable. Interestingly, the E elements of these four examined isolates showed a key deletion at site 30, which produced a new c-Ets-1 binding site. An 11-bp insertion was also found in the E element of isolate JS09GY3 located between bp 66 and 67 according to the sequence of reference strain HPRS103, while almost all previously reported Chinese strains showed an almost identical deletion of 127 bp in the same region. CONCLUSIONS: Five ALV-J isolates were obtained from six field infected commercial layer chickens. Coexistence of hemangioma and ML were observed in these infected cases both macro- and microscopically. Complete proviral genome sequences of two isolates (JS09GY3 and JS09GY6) and the partial sequences of the other two isolates (JS09GY2 and JS09GY5) were determined. The isolates were found to be recombinants of ALV-J with a PBS-leader sequence originating from other retroviruses. The Gp85 protein with an amino acid deletion, a contiguous 11-bp insertion mutation in the E element, and a novel binding site, were noted in the proviral genomes.","['Wu, Xiaoping', 'Qian, Kun', 'Qin, Aijian', 'Shen, Haiyu', 'Wang, Pingping', 'Jin, Wenjie', 'Eltahir, Yassir Mohammed']","['Wu X', 'Qian K', 'Qin A', 'Shen H', 'Wang P', 'Jin W', 'Eltahir YM']","['Key Lab of Jiangsu Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University, No.12 East Wenhui Road, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, 225009. pingping19781015@yahoo.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100731,Netherlands,Vet Res Commun,Veterinary research communications,8100520,['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Chickens', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Hemangioma/*veterinary/virology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Reassortant Viruses/classification/genetics']",PMC2931761,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/01/06 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11259-010-9436-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Res Commun. 2010 Oct;34(7):619-32. doi: 10.1007/s11259-010-9436-8.

The resultant stretching was analyzed on consecutive cultivation days with respect to the influence of medium consumption. Systematic experiments clearly showed that the medium consumption affected the viscoelastic properties of the investigated human leukemia cells HL-60. The shift in pH value and the culture medium depletion were identified as potentially responsible for the differing temporal development of the cell deformation.

METHODS: We used HL-60 cells, and the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method was used for cell proliferation assays. For detection of apoptosis, the Annexin V-binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry. To evaluate the cell cycle, we used a FITC BrdU Flow KIT and flow cytometry. Total extracted and equivalent amounts of protein were examined by Western blotting using specific antibodies. RESULTS: ACR and VK(2) dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells. These two agents in combination synergistically inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis. VK(2) inhibited activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, and ACR plus VK(2) cooperatively inhibited phosphorylation of RXRalpha and the growth of HL-60 cells. Moreover, ACR and VK(2) induced increases in G0/G1 phase HL-60 cells, alone and synergistically in combination. CONCLUSION: The synergistic effects of ACR and VK(2) on HL-60 cells may provide a novel strategy for treating leukemia.","['Kitagawa, Junichi', 'Hara, Takeshi', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi', 'Ninomiya, Soranobu', 'Ogawa, Kengo', 'Adachi, Seiji', 'Kanemura, Nobuhiro', 'Kasahara, Senji', 'Shimizu, Masahito', 'Moriwaki, Hisataka']","['Kitagawa J', 'Hara T', 'Tsurumi H', 'Ninomiya S', 'Ogawa K', 'Adachi S', 'Kanemura N', 'Kasahara S', 'Shimizu M', 'Moriwaki H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu, 501-1194, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100731,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '11ALM7A4RV ((2E,4E,6E,10E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2,4,6,10,14-hexadecapentaenoic', 'acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/physiology', 'Retinoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin K 2/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-010-0938-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2011 May;137(5):779-87. doi: 10.1007/s00432-010-0938-0.

To assess the ability of respondents to differentiate between the terms 'stray' and 'feral'. METHODS: A face-to-face questionnaire, consisting of 12 questions in three sections, was distributed by volunteers within Auckland (n=255) and Kaitaia (n=99) to gather information pertinent to the study's aims. Section 1 covered respondents' personal details; Section 2, ownership and care of cats, including whether or not the cats were vaccinated against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV); and Section 3, awareness of legislation and differences between the terms 'stray' and 'feral'. RESULTS: Overall, fewer than half of respondents were aware of the animal welfare legislation within New Zealand or the semantic differences between the terms 'stray' and 'feral' as they appear in the dictionary. Respondents >or=41 years old, and individuals employed in the animal-related sector, were significantly more likely to be aware of the legislation and make the correct distinction between the terms compared with those aged <or=40, and those working in a non-animal-related profession. A significantly greater percentage of cat owners (42%) provided care for cats they did not own compared with non-owners (26%). Results also indicated a large majority of cat owners may consider standard annual vaccinations to include vaccination against FIV and FeLV. CONCLUSION: Dissemination of information about animal welfare legislation is important for the care of cats within New Zealand, and the definitions of the terms 'stray' and 'feral' need to be more clearly stated in order to prevent confusion. This is especially important when cats may be controlled using lethal measures under different legislative precedents that are not necessarily consistent with one another. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Veterinary clinics may act as a primary source for the dissemination of information about relevant welfare acts as well as preventative health care, thus improving the welfare of cats. Cat owners need to be better educated about the diseases covered by annual vaccination.","['Farnworth, M J', 'Campbell, J', 'Adams, N J']","['Farnworth MJ', 'Campbell J', 'Adams NJ']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Unitec Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand. mfarnworth@unitec.ac.nz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,N Z Vet J,New Zealand veterinary journal,0021406,,IM,"['Animal Rights/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Animal Welfare/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Animals', '*Cats', 'New Zealand', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vaccination']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00480169.2010.68624 [doi]'],ppublish,N Z Vet J. 2010 Aug;58(4):213-7. doi: 10.1080/00480169.2010.68624.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GVHD (aGVHD, by day +100) was 0.42 for grade II-IV and 0.22 for grade III-IV. The CI of all aGVHD (NIH, that is, no time limit) at 1 year was 0.45 for grade II-IV and 0.32 for grade III-IV. Infused CD34 cell dose (>1 x 10(5)/kg), pretransplant bacterial infection and nonmalignant disorders were risk factors for grade II-IV aGVHD on univariate analysis. Infused CD34 cell dose remained significant on multivariate analysis. At 1 year, the CI of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) using the Seattle criteria was 0.27, whereas that for cGVHD (NIH) was 0.08. By NIH criteria, the classic form of cGVHD was uncommon (5%) after UCBT. Instead, the acute (71%) and overlap (24%) GVHD variants predominated. Grade II-IV aGVHD was a significant risk factor for cGVHD by both Seattle and NIH criteria. We conclude that GVHD after day +100 after UCBT typically carries features of aGVHD. Moreover, and in marked contrast to adult unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the GVHD observed in this series did not adversely affect survival.","['Alsultan, A', 'Giller, R H', 'Gao, D', 'Bathurst, J', 'Hild, E', 'Gore, L', 'Foreman, N K', 'Keating, A', 'Quinones, R R']","['Alsultan A', 'Giller RH', 'Gao D', 'Bathurst J', 'Hild E', 'Gore L', 'Foreman NK', 'Keating A', 'Quinones RR']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Children's Hospital and University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100802,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2010174 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2010.174 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 May;46(5):668-75. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2010.174.

LMO2 is not normally expressed in T cells, yet ectopic expression is seen in the majority of T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) patients with specific translocations involving LMO2 in only a subset of these patients. Ectopic lmo2 expression in thymocytes of transgenic mice causes T-ALL, and retroviral vector integration into the LMO2 locus was implicated in the development of clonal T-cell disease in patients undergoing gene therapy. Using array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation, we now demonstrate that in contrast to B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, human T-ALL samples largely use promoter elements with little influence from distal enhancers. Active LMO2 promoter elements in T-ALL included a previously unrecognized third promoter, which we demonstrate to be active in cell lines, primary T-ALL patients and transgenic mice. The ETS factors ERG and FLI1 previously implicated in lmo2-dependent mouse models of T-ALL bind to the novel LMO2 promoter in human T-ALL samples, while in return LMO2 binds to blood stem/progenitor enhancers in the FLI1 and ERG gene loci. Moreover, LMO2, ERG and FLI1 all regulate the +1 enhancer of HHEX/PRH, which was recently implicated as a key mediator of early progenitor expansion in LMO2-driven T-ALL. Our data therefore suggest that a self-sustaining triad of LMO2/ERG/FLI1 stabilizes the expression of important mediators of the leukaemic phenotype such as HHEX/PRH.","['Oram, S H', 'Thoms, J A I', 'Pridans, C', 'Janes, M E', 'Kinston, S J', 'Anand, S', 'Landry, J-R', 'Lock, R B', 'Jayaraman, P-S', 'Huntly, B J', 'Pimanda, J E', 'Gottgens, B']","['Oram SH', 'Thoms JA', 'Pridans C', 'Janes ME', 'Kinston SJ', 'Anand S', 'Landry JR', 'Lock RB', 'Jayaraman PS', 'Huntly BJ', 'Pimanda JE', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/NC3RS_/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction', 'of Animals in Research/United Kingdom', 'G116/187/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100802,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010320 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.320 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Oct 28;29(43):5796-808. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.320.

Members of the Src family of kinases (SFKs) are involved in the process of metastasis and dasatinib inhibits the migration and invasiveness of human melanoma cell lines in vitro. SFKs are also involved in immune function and angiogenesis, which both contribute to As active and passive immunotherapies continue to be investigated in metastatic melanoma, we investigated possible interactions between kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. A murine syngenic model of metastatic melanoma in which B16F10 cells expressed ovalbumin (B16-OVA) was employed and the active immunotherapy comprised immunization with an OVA-expressing recombinant fowlpox virus (FPVOVA).Dasatinib did not affect B16-OVA viability, proliferation, migration or soft agar colony formation. However, depending on drug dose and schedule, differences in the metastatic behavior of B16-OVA were observed in vivo after dasatinib therapy. At a dose of 5 mg/kg/day given before tumor challenge, dasatinib therapy reduced the number of pulmonary metastases. Conversely, a higher dose (25 mg/kg/day), did not affect the number of pulmonary metastases and increased the number of extra-pulmonary metastases. Finally, immunization of B16-OVA-bearing mice with FPVOVA reduced the number of lung metastases. Prior treatment of these mice with dasatinib 5 mg/kg/day did not affect the incidence of lung metastases. Although the mechanisms by which dasatinib alters the metastatic behavior of B16-OVA cells in vivo remain to be determined, we hypothesize that dasatinib acts via multiple tumor-extrinsic processes that include immune function and neoangiogenesis.","['Fraser, Cara K', 'Lousberg, Erin L', 'Guerin, Leigh R', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Brown, Michael P', 'Diener, Kerrilyn R', 'Hayball, John D']","['Fraser CK', 'Lousberg EL', 'Guerin LR', 'Hughes TP', 'Brown MP', 'Diener KR', 'Hayball JD']","['Hanson Institute, Adelaide, The University of South Australia, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101001,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fowlpox virus/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ovalbumin/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/03/03 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['12926 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.10.7.12926 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Oct 1;10(7):715-27. doi: 10.4161/cbt.10.7.12926.

However, the precise mechanisms still remain to be uncovered. We found that while c-Cbl E3 ligase induced ubiquitin-dependent degradation of mature and phosphorylated BCR-ABL proteins, another E3 ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein) degraded immature BCR-ABL proteins and efficiently suppressed BCR-ABL-dependent leukemic growth. Interestingly, Bag1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1), a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsc70, directly bound BCR-ABL with a high affinity, which was enhanced by CHIP and Hsp90 inhibitors, inhibited by imatinib and competed with Hsc70. Bag1 knockdown abrogated Hsp90 inhibitor-induced BCR-ABL degradation. Bag1 induced binding of immature BCR-ABL to proteasome. Expression of Bag1 induced BCR-ABL degradation and growth suppression in Ba/F3 cells when Hsc70 was knocked down with or without CHIP induction. CHIP appears to sort newly synthesized Hsp90-unchaperoned BCR-ABL to the proteasome not only by inhibiting Hsc70 and thereby promoting Bag1 to bind BCR-ABL, but also by ubiquitinating BCR-ABL. Bag1 may direct CHIP/Hsc70-regulated protein triage decisions on BCR-ABL immediately after translation to the degradation pathway.","['Tsukahara, Fujiko', 'Maru, Yoshiro']","['Tsukahara F', 'Maru Y']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University School of Medicine, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100730,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (STUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31155-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-249623 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 4;116(18):3582-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-249623.

From an evolutionary perspective, the activity of p53 has to be backed up by other protein(s) in case of any functional impairment of this protein, to trigger DNA damage-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. We adopted multiple experimental approaches to demonstrate that in p53-impaired cancer cells, DNA damage caused accumulation of p53 paralogue p73 via Chk-1 that strongly impacted Bax expression and p53-independent apoptosis. On the contrary, when p53 function was restored by ectopic expression, Chk-2 induced p53 accumulation that in turn overshadowed p73 activity, suggesting an antagonistic interaction between p53 family members. To understand such interaction better, p53-expressing cells were impaired differentially for p53 activity. In wild-type p53-expressing cancer cells that were silenced for p53 for several generations, p73 was activated, whereas no such trend was observed when p53 was transiently silenced.

The results demonstrated that total CD20 protein levels were consistently decreased by approximately 60% in CLL B cells with low CD20 fluorescence staining. Surprisingly, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that CD20 mRNA levels were normal or close to normal, depending on the comparative B cell population, and did not correlate well with protein expression.

Historically, outcomes from the use of a one-antigen MMRD were considered equivalent to those from the use of a matched unrelated donor (UD). Recent improvements in UD stem cell transplantation (SCT) resulting from better molecular HLA matching justifies investigating whether UD should be preferred over MMRD in adult patients with acute leukemia. Here, we compared the outcomes of MMRD (n = 89) and HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele-matched UD (n = 700) SCT reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research between 1995 and 2005. The patients underwent transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission. Donor type was not associated with hematologic recovery. Univariate and multivariate comparisons of MMRD versus HLA-matched UD transplants showed no statistically significant differences in overall survival, disease-free survival, treatment-related mortality, relapse, or 100-day grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). MMRD SCT was associated with a lower rate of chronic GVHD at 1 year (35% vs 47%; P = .03), which was confirmed by multivariate analysis (relative risk, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.85; P < .01). According to our data, HLA-matched UD and MMRD SCT are associated with comparable survival. Given that less chronic GVHD was observed in the MMRD transplantations, this option, when available, remains the first choice in patients with acute leukemia without an HLA-identical sibling in need of allogeneic SCT.","['Valcarcel, David', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Wang, Tao', 'Kan, Fangyu', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Marks, David I', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Oudshoorn, Machteld', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Setterholm, Michelle', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Gajewski, James L', 'Marino, Susana R', 'Senitzer, David', 'Lee, Stephanie J']","['Valcarcel D', 'Sierra J', 'Wang T', 'Kan F', 'Gupta V', 'Hale GA', 'Marks DI', 'McCarthy PL', 'Oudshoorn M', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Ringden O', 'Setterholm M', 'Spellman SR', 'Waller EK', 'Gajewski JL', 'Marino SR', 'Senitzer D', 'Lee SJ']","['Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. dvalcarcel@santpau.cat']",['eng'],"['U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100730,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (HLA-A Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'HLA-A Antigens/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3355271,['NIHMS264249'],2010/08/03 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00323-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.07.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 May;17(5):640-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.07.022.

Few reports have described outcomes of SCT in pediatric patients with refractory acute leukemia. To identify prognostic factors for these patients, we retrospectively evaluated SCT outcomes for advanced acute leukemia in 82 pediatric patients from 3 transplant units in Nagoya City between 1990 and 2008. Median age at transplantation was 8 years (range, 0.5-17 years). Transplantation was performed in the first refractory relapse for 53 patients (64.6%), in the second or subsequent relapse for 16 patients (19.5%), and during primary induction failure for 13 patients (15.9%). Only 4 patients (4.9%) underwent transplantation in the untreated first relapse, and 39 patients (47.6%) received unrelated donor progenitor cells. Of the 82 patients, 61 died (77.9%), with a median survival of 7.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2-10.0 months). Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.6-6.9 months).

However, the biological activities of DDAB nanoparticles in mammalian cells are insufficiently understood. The purpose of this study was to establish a critical role of DDAB in cellular response. Here, we demonstrate that DDAB is a potent inducer of cell death in a wide range of tumor cell lines, wherein leukemia cells (HL-60 and U937) and neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a) were more sensitive to DDAB than carcinoma cells such as HepG2 and Caco-2 cells. Moreover, in HL-60 cells, treatment with DDAB led to increased numbers of apoptotic cells with fragmented DNA (99.6%) and high levels of caspase-3 activation in comparison to that with actinomycin D. Cotreatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) or a polyethylene glycol (Mr 2000) (PEG 2000) effectively prevented the activation of caspase-3 induced by DDAB. These results suggest that DDAB can trigger caspase-3-mediated apoptosis through the extrinsic caspase-8 pathway and cytotoxic pore formation in cell membrane. Therefore, the present findings provide new insight into the biological activity of DDAB to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis.","['Kusumoto, Ken-ichi', 'Ishikawa, Tomoyuki']","['Kusumoto K', 'Ishikawa T']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Biotechnology and Food Research Institute, Fukuoka Industrial Technology Center, Kurume, Fukuoka 8390861, Japan. kkusumoto@fitc.pref.fukuoka.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100730,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '13146-86-6 (didodecyldimethylammonium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Light', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Surface-Active Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(10)00641-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.07.114 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2010 Oct 15;147(2):246-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.07.114.

MC-LR significantly improved mRNA and protein expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-12 in liver, whereas it inhibited expression of CHOP and caspase-12 in kidney. MC-LR also induced significant down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) mRNA expression in liver and weak up-regulation in kidney. These results indicated the involvement of the ERS pathway in MC-LR-induced apoptosis of hepatic cells but not in renal cells of mice.

For some cancers, including leukaemia and tumours of the central nervous system, age and sex have been identified as important prognostic indicators. METHODS: We examined long-term survival, and affects of age and sex, in a population-based case-control study. Children (0-14 years) newly diagnosed with cancer were ascertained between 1991 and 1996 (n=4433). Follow-up information was obtained from the National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre for Health and Social Care which records all exits from the NHS including deaths. RESULTS: For all cancer diagnoses combined, 5-year survival was 72.7% dropping to 67.9% at 15 years. As expected, survival differed between diagnostic subtypes ranging from 38.1% for intracranial embryonal tumours to 96.2% for Hodgkin lymphoma. Compared to girls, boys diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were at a higher risk of dying (RR=1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.53), whereas boys diagnosed with an intracranial embryonal tumour were at a lower risk of death (RR=0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.91). CONCLUSION: Our initial findings are consistent with previous reports, and highlight the importance of considering differences by age and sex. The completeness and population-based nature of the original case-control study is an important feature which will provide the basis for future more detailed investigations linking disease determinants to outcome.","['Johnston, W Thomas', 'Lightfoot, Tracy J', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Roman, Eve']","['Johnston WT', 'Lightfoot TJ', 'Simpson J', 'Roman E']","['Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, Y010 5DD, United Kingdom. tom.johnston@egu.york.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100731,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(10)00128-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2010.06.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2010 Dec;34(6):659-66. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2010.06.020.

METHODS: We describe predictors of survival for children in El Salvador with ALL. We included patients <16 years diagnosed with ALL between January 2001 and July 2007 treated with the El Salvador-Guatemala-Honduras II protocol. Demographic, disease-related, socioeconomic and nutritional variables were examined as potential predictors of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 260/443 patients (58.7%) were classified as standard risk. Standard- and high-risk 5-year EFS were 56.3 +/- 4.5% and 48.6 +/- 5.5%; 5-year OS were 77.7 +/- 3.8% and 61.9 +/- 5.8%, respectively. Among standard-risk children, socioeconomic variables such as higher monthly income (hazard ratio [HR] per $100 = 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.99; P=0.04]) and parental secondary education (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.84; P = 0.01) were associated with better EFS. Among high-risk children, higher initial white blood cell (HR per 10x10(9)/L = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05; P<0.001) predicted worse EFS; socioeconomic variables were not predictive. The difference in EFS and OS appeared related to overestimating OS secondary to poor follow-up after abandonment/relapse. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic variables predicted worse EFS in standard-risk children while disease-related variables were predictive in high-risk patients. Further studies should delineate pathways through which socioeconomic status affects EFS in order to design effective interventions. EFS should be the primary outcome in LIC studies.","['Bonilla, Miguel', 'Gupta, Sumit', 'Vasquez, Roberto', 'Fuentes, Soad L', 'deReyes, Gladis', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Bonilla M', 'Gupta S', 'Vasquez R', 'Fuentes SL', 'deReyes G', 'Ribeiro R', 'Sung L']","[""Paediatric Oncology, Benjamin Bloom National Children's Hospital, San Salvador, El Salvador.""]",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100730,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'El Salvador/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/05/10 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)00658-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Dec;46(18):3280-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.07.001.

However, the requirement of high doses and suboptimal cost-effectiveness limits the use of the treatment. Here we propose to use a new drug format based on non-immunoglobulin structures, potentially offering increased clinical efficacy while being more cost-effective. For this purpose, DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins) against the constant heavy chain region of IgE have been isolated. DARPins were binding to IgE with high specificity and affinities in the low nanomolar range. Selected DARPins antagonized the interaction between IgE and its high-affinity receptor in inhibition assays. Furthermore, anti-IgE DARPins were shown to inhibit proinflammatory mediator release from rat basophilic leukemia cells expressing human high-affinity IgE receptors with higher efficacy than the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody omalizumab.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We had previously identified morphologically that the linoleic acid rich fraction (DCM/F7) from the tubers of this plant induces selective anti-proliferative effects and apoptosis in CEMss cells. In this present study, we subjected the same DCM/F7 fraction to cell based activity analyses in order to determine the possible mechanism of cell death in leukemic CEMss cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extraction of Typhonium flagelliforme tuber has done and fractionation has been done by vacuum liquid column chromatography. The anti-proliferative activity was assayed using MTT and the apoptosis detection was done by Annexin V and DNA laddering assay. Colorimetric caspase assay and immunoblot analysis were employed to detect the expression of protein associated with cell death. Cell cycle analysis was done using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the cancer inhibitory effect of the DCM/F7 fraction in CEMss cells was 3 +/- 0.08 mug/ml (IC(50)). An early apoptotic induction in CEMss cells was observed by Annexin V assay, which showed a clear dose-dependent DNA fragmentation being observed in gel electrophoresis at 10 and 20 mug/ml. The DCM/F7 fraction at 3 mug/ml significantly arrested CEMss cells at G0/G1 phase (p<0.05). A constant but increasing pattern-related Sub-G0/G1 index was observed between 12 and 72 h treatment. In relation to this, we further investigated the biochemical events leading to cell death and found that the DCM/F7 fraction increased the cellular levels of caspase-3 and -9 on treated cells. Our results indicated that cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol increased gradually as the DCM/F7 concentration increases, which later lead to the subsequent cleavage of PARP in to 85kDa fragments. On the contrary, Bcl-2 protein was found to decrease concomitantly during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results presented in this study demonstrated that the DCM/F7 fraction inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells, leading to the programmed cell death, which was confirmed to be through the mitochondrial pathway.","['Mohan, Syam', 'Abdul, Ahmad Bustamam', 'Abdelwahab, Siddig Ibrahim', 'Al-Zubairi, Adel S', 'Sukari, Mohamed Aspollah', 'Abdullah, Rasedee', 'Elhassan Taha, Manal Mohamed', 'Ibrahim, Mohamed Yousif', 'Syam, Suvitha']","['Mohan S', 'Abdul AB', 'Abdelwahab SI', 'Al-Zubairi AS', 'Sukari MA', 'Abdullah R', 'Elhassan Taha MM', 'Ibrahim MY', 'Syam S']","['UPM-MAKNA Cancer Research Laboratory, Institute of Bioscience, University Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Malaysia. syammohanm@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100729,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Araceae/*chemistry', 'Caspase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Malaysia', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/drug effects/metabolism']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/01/06 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(10)00522-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.043 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2010 Oct 5;131(3):592-600. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.043.

In here, we review the main functions of the HTLV-1 orf-I products. The 12kDa product from orf-I (p12) is proteolytically cleaved within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate the 8kDa protein (p8). At the steady state, both proteins are expressed at similar levels in transfected T-cells. The p12 protein remains in the ER and cis-Golgi, whereas the p8 protein traffics to the cell surface and is recruited to the immunological synapse. The p12 and the p8 proteins have seemingly opposite effects on T-cells; the ER resident p12, modulates T-cell activation and proliferation, whereas p8 induces T-cell anergy. The p8 protein also increases the formation of cellular conduits, is transferred to neighboring T-cells, and increases virus transmission. The requirement for HTLV-1 infectivity of orf-I is demonstrated by the loss of virus infectivity in macaques exposed to an engineered virus, whereby expression of orf-I was ablated. Altogether the current knowledge demonstrates that the concerted activity of p8 and p12 is essential for the persistence of virus infected cells in the host.","['Van Prooyen, Nancy', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Gold, Heather', 'Bialuk, Izabela', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['Van Prooyen N', 'Andresen V', 'Gold H', 'Bialuk I', 'Pise-Masison C', 'Franchini G']","['Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccine Section, Vaccine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-5065, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20100729,England,Mol Aspects Med,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['*Cell Communication', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC2967610,['NIHMS234654'],2010/08/03 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0098-2997(10)00057-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mam.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Aspects Med. 2010 Oct;31(5):333-43. doi: 10.1016/j.mam.2010.07.001.

We previously reported that surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors detect large changes of refractive index with living cells, such as mast cells, keratinocyte, human basophils and B-cells activated by biological stimuli. However, conventional SPR sensors detect only an average change of refractive index with thousands of cells at detectable area on a sensor chip. In this study, we developed an SPR imaging (SPRI) sensor with a CMOS camera and an objective lens in order to analyze refractive index of individual living cells and their changes upon stimuli. The SPRI sensor could detect reactions of individual rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, mouse keratinocyte (PAM212) cells, and human epidermal carcinoma (A431) cells in response to either specific or non-specific stimuli, such as antigen, phorbol ester or epidermal growth factor, with or without their inhibitors, resembling signals obtained by a conventional SPR sensor. Moreover, we distinguished reactions of different type cells, co-cultured on a sensor chip, and revealed that the increase of refractive index around nuclei is rapid and potent as compared to that in peripheries in the reaction of RBL-2H3 cells against antigen. This system may be a useful tool to investigate the mechanism of refractive index-changes evoked in near-membrane fields of living cells, and to develop a system of high-throughput screening for clinical diagnosis.","['Yanase, Yuhki', 'Hiragun, Takaaki', 'Kaneko, Sakae', 'Gould, Hannah J', 'Greaves, Malcolm W', 'Hide, Michihiro']","['Yanase Y', 'Hiragun T', 'Kaneko S', 'Gould HJ', 'Greaves MW', 'Hide M']","['Department of Dermatology, Programs for Biomedical Research, Division of Molecular Medical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8551, Japan.']",['eng'],['G0501494/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100731,England,Biosens Bioelectron,Biosensors & bioelectronics,9001289,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Physiological Phenomena', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Refractometry/*instrumentation', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted/*instrumentation', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance/*instrumentation']",,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0956-5663(10)00366-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bios.2010.06.065 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosens Bioelectron. 2010 Oct 15;26(2):674-81. doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2010.06.065.

FasL/Fas-induced apoptosis plays an important role in various immunological processes. The aim of this study is to investigate the immune evasion in human lung carcinoma cell A549 induced by human lymphoma cell Jurkat via Fas/FasL pathway. METHODS: Jurkat cells and A549 cells were co-cultured at different proportions. The apoptotic rates of A549 cells were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Protein levels of Fas, FasL and Caspase-8 in A549 cells were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Survival rates of A549 cells gradually decreased and apoptotic rates of A549 cells were significantly enhanced along with ratio increasing between Jurkat and A549. Meanwhile, the protein levels of Fas and Caspase-8 gradually increased in A549 cells, and the protein levels of FasL had no significant difference in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The Jurkat cells might decrease the survival rates of A549 cells and enhanced its apoptosis and immune evasion partly via Fas/FasL pathway.","['Wang, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Guoqiang', 'Dai, Jigang', 'Min, Jiaxin']","['Wang H', 'Zhang G', 'Dai J', 'Min J']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Xinqiao Hospital, Affiliated to the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer,101126433,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/parasitology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC6000381,,2010/08/03 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2010.07.05 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi. 2010 Jul;13(7):681-5. doi: 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2010.07.05.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, platinum based treatments are widely used, the disease becomes treatment refractory within two years, and novel treatment options should be searched. All- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces growth arrest, differentiation and cell death in some types of cancer cells and its combination with various anticancer agents results in enhanced cytotoxicity. Zoledronic acid is a common bisphosphonate known for its anticancer effects beyond its current use in the treatment of cancer-induced bone disease. We aimed to investigate the possible additive/synergistic effect of both agents in OVCAR-3 and MDAH-2774 ovarian cancer cell lines, since both agents show superiority to conventional cytotoxics in terms of adverse events. METHODS: XTT cell proliferation assay was used for showing cytotoxicity. For verifying apoptosis, both DNA Fragmentation by ELISA assay and caspase 3/7 activity measurement were used. OligoGeArray which consists of 112 apoptosis related genes was used to elucidate the genetic changes within cancer cells. To validate our oligoarray results, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on four selected genes that were maximally effected by the combination treatment: lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRSF1A), TNFRSF1A-associated death domain protein (TRADD). RESULTS: We demonstrated that a novel combination of ATRA and zoledronic acid is a strong inducer of apoptotic related cell death in both ovarian cancer cells. While the combination therapy significantly induced proapoptotic genes such as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), TRADD and caspase 4, some of the antiapoptotic genes such as members of MCL-1, LTBR, BAG3 and Bcl-2 family members were inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: These are the preliminary molecular results of a novel combination treatment of ATRA and zoledronic acid, with fewer side effects as compared to conventional cytotoxic agents. With additional experimental analysis, it may serve as a good option for the treatment of refractory and elderly ovarian cancer patients, for whom there exists very limited choice of treatment.","['Karabulut, Bulent', 'Karaca, Burcak', 'Varol, Umut', 'Muslu, Ugur', 'Cakar, Burcu', 'Atmaca, Harika', 'Kisim, Asli', 'Uzunoglu, Selim', 'Uslu, Ruchan']","['Karabulut B', 'Karaca B', 'Varol U', 'Muslu U', 'Cakar B', 'Atmaca H', 'Kisim A', 'Uzunoglu S', 'Uslu R']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Tulay Aktas Oncology Hospital, School of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100730,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Diphosphonates/administration & dosage', '*Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zoledronic Acid']",PMC2924277,,2010/08/03 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/08/03 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-29-102 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-29-102 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jul 30;29:102. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-29-102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, HOX expression patterns in leukemia cells compared to normal lymphoid progenitors have not been systematically studied in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes. PROCEDURE: The RNA expression levels of HOXA, HOXB, and CDX1/2 genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in a cohort of 61 diagnostic pediatric ALL samples and FACS-sorted subpopulations of normal lymphoid progenitors. RESULTS: The RNA expression of HOXA7-10, HOXA13, and HOXB2-4 genes was exclusively detected in leukemic cells and immature progenitors. The RNA expression of HOXB6 and CDX2 genes was exclusively detected in leukemic cells but not in B-lineage cells at any of the studied developmental stages. HOXA3-4, HOXA7, and HOXB3-4 genes were differentially expressed between BCP-ALL and T-ALL subgroups, and among genotypically defined MLL/AF4, TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, hyperdiploid and normal karyotype subgroups. However, this differential expression did not define specific clusters in hierarchical cluster analysis. HOXA7 gene was low expressed at the RNA level in patients with hyperdiploid leukemia, whereas HOXB7 and CDX2 genes were low expressed in TEL/AML1-positive and BCR/ABL-positive cases, respectively. In contrast to previous findings in acute myeloid leukemia, high HOXA RNA expression was associated with an excellent prognosis in Cox's regression model (P = 0.03). In MLL/AF4-positive ALL, lower HOXA RNA expression correlated with the methylation status of their promoters.

Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with activity in myeloid disease. The authors hypothesized that low-dose azacitidine administered after transplant would reduce recurrence rates, and conducted a study to determine a safe dose/schedule combination. METHODS: Forty-five high-risk patients were treated. Median age was 60 years; median number of comorbidities was 3; 67% were not in remission. By using a Bayesian adaptive method to determine the best dose/schedule combination based on time to toxicity, the authors investigated combinations of 5 daily azacitidine doses, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mg/m2, and 4 schedules: 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles, each with 5 days of drug and 25 days of rest. Cycle 1 started on Day +40. RESULTS: Reversible thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal combination was 32 mg/m2 given for 4 cycles. Median follow-up was 20.5 months. One-year event-free and overall survival were 58% and 77%, justifying further studies to estimate long-term clinical benefit. No dose significantly affected DNA global methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine at 32 mg/m2 given for 5 days is safe and can be administered after allogeneic transplant for at least 4 cycles to heavily pretreated AML/MDS patients. The trial also suggested that this treatment may prolong event-free and overall survival, and that more cycles may be associated with greater benefit.","['de Lima, Marcos', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Thall, Peter F', 'de Padua Silva, Leandro', 'Jones, Roy B', 'Komanduri, Krishna', 'Braun, Thomas M', 'Nguyen, Hoang Q', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['de Lima M', 'Giralt S', 'Thall PF', 'de Padua Silva L', 'Jones RB', 'Komanduri K', 'Braun TM', 'Nguyen HQ', 'Champlin R', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy, The University of Texas M.

However, aberrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling has been implicated in many human cancers, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Therefore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network is considered as a validated target for innovative cancer therapy. The limit of acceptable toxicity for standard polychemotherapy has been reached in AML. Novel therapeutic strategies are therefore needed. This review highlights how the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis is constitutively active in AML patients, where it affects survival, proliferation, and drug-resistance of leukemic cells including leukemic stem cells. Effective targeting of this pathway with small molecule kinase inhibitors, employed alone or in combination with other drugs, could result in the suppression of leukemic cell growth. Furthermore, targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network with small pharmacological inhibitors, employed either alone or in combinations with other drugs, may result in less toxic and more efficacious treatment of AML patients. Efforts to exploit pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade which show efficacy and safety in the clinical setting are now underway.","['Martelli, Alberto M', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Martelli AM', 'Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Human Anatomical Sciences University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['R01 CA098195-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01098195/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC2911128,['NIHMS220572'],2010/07/31 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['114 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2010 Jun;1(2):89-103. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.114.,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K/Akt/mTOR', 'combination therapy', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells', 'signal transduction modulators', 'targeted therapy']",,,

We have previously shown that 4-(3-Cl-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC), an adamantyl-substituted retinoid molecule, induced apoptosis and required NF-kappaB activation in prostate and breast carcinoma cells. Here, we show that 3-Cl-AHPC activated both IkappaB kinase (IKK)alpha and IKKbeta with subsequent activation of the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways in the human breast carcinoma and leukemia cell lines. 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB canonical pathway occurred within 6 h, whereas maximal activation of the NF-kappaB noncanonical pathway required 48 h. Knockout of IKKalpha or IKKbeta expression in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and knockdown of IKKalpha or IKKbeta in MDA-MB-468 cells resulted in the inhibition of 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis, indicating that activation of canonical and noncanonical pathways are required for maximal 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis. 3-Cl-AHPC activation of the noncanonical pathway was preceded by caspase-mediated decrease in the E3-ligase c-IAP1 with subsequent stabilization of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) expression, increased binding of NIK by TRAF3, activation of IKKalpha, and the resultant increased levels of RelB and p52. Increased expression of c-IAP1 blocked 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated stabilization of NIK levels and 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis. Cdc37 expression was required for activation of IKKalpha and IKKbeta by 3-Cl-AHPC. These findings suggest that NF-kappaB pathways have an important role in 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis.","['Farhana, L', 'Dawson, M I', 'Murshed, F', 'Fontana, J A']","['Farhana L', 'Dawson MI', 'Murshed F', 'Fontana JA']","['Deparment of Medicine, John D Dingell VA Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.

Dysregulation of genomic imprinting leads to several complex pathological conditions. Though the genetic and epigenetic regulation of imprinted genes has been well studied, their protein aspects are largely ignored. Here, we systematically studied a sub-network centered on proteins encoded by imprinted genes within human interactome. Using concepts of network biology, we uncover a highly connected, transitive and central network module of imprinted gene-products and their interacting partners (IGPN). The network is enriched in development, metabolism and cell cycle related functions and its malfunctioning ascribes error intolerance to human interactome network. Further, detailed analysis revealed that its higher centrality is determined by 'date' interactions among the proteins belonging to different functional classes than the 'party' interactions within the same functional class. Interestingly, a significant proportion of this network genetically associates with disease phenotypes. Moreover, the network comprises of gene-sets that are upregulated in leukemia, psychosis, obesity/diabetes and downregulated in autism. We conclude that imprinted gene-products are part of a functionally and topologically important module of human interactome and errors in this sub-network are intolerant to, otherwise robust, human interactome. The findings might also shed light on how imprinted genes, which are rather very few, coordinate at protein level to pleiotropically regulate growth and metabolism during embryonic and post-natal development.","['Sandhu, Kuljeet Singh']",['Sandhu KS'],"['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. kuljeet.sandhu@ki.se']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101001,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Databases, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Systems Biology']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['12883 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.5.7.12883 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2010 Oct 1;5(7):627-36. doi: 10.4161/epi.5.7.12883.

However, application of this as a molecular marker for risk stratification in patients with AML is limited. DESIGN AND METHODS: To elucidate the impact of patterns of TSG methylation on outcome in cytogenetically normal patients, 106 samples from patients with having normal cytogenetic AML were evaluated for methylation of 12 genes by MSP. For sake of comparison, samples from patients with AML and abnormal cytogenetics (n = 63) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Methylation frequencies in the whole group (n = 169) were similar to previous reports for CDH1 (31%), ER (31%), FHIT (9%), p15 (INK4b) (44%), p73 (25%), and SOCS1 (75%). Methylation of CTNNA1 was observed in 10%, CEBP-alpha in16%, CEBP-delta in 2%, MLH1 in 24%, MGMT in 11% and DAPK in 2% of AML samples. We find that DNA methylation was more prevalent in patients with normal compared to karyotypically abnormal AML for most genes; CEBPalpha (20% vs 9%), CTNNA1 (14% vs 4%), and ER (41% vs 19%) (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In contrast, p73 was more frequently methylated in patients with karyotypic abnormalities (17% vs 38%; p < 0.05), perhaps due to specific silencing of the pro-apoptotic promoter shifting p73 gene expression to the anti-apoptotic transcript. In AML patients with normal cytogenetics, TSG methylation was not associated with event free or overall survival in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AML, TSG methylation is more frequent in patients with normal karyotype than those with karyotypic abnormalities but does not confer independent prognostic information for patients with normal cytogenetics.","['Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Hooker, Craig M', 'Mohammad, Helai P', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Herman, James G', 'Carraway, Hetty E']","['Griffiths EA', 'Gore SD', 'Hooker CM', 'Mohammad HP', 'McDevitt MA', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Herman JG', 'Carraway HE']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['K24 CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101001,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (CTNNA1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (alpha Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'U937 Cells', 'alpha Catenin/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC3052845,,2010/07/31 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['12558 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.5.7.12558 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2010 Oct 1;5(7):590-600. doi: 10.4161/epi.5.7.12558.

These results demonstrate that PTIP promotes specific chromatin changes that control the accessibility of the Igh locus to CSR and suggest a nonredundant role for the MLL3-MLL4 complex in altering antibody effector function.","['Daniel, Jeremy A', 'Santos, Margarida Almeida', 'Wang, Zhibin', 'Zang, Chongzhi', 'Schwab, Kristopher R', 'Jankovic, Mila', 'Filsuf, Darius', 'Chen, Hua-Tang', 'Gazumyan, Anna', 'Yamane, Arito', 'Cho, Young-Wook', 'Sun, Hong-Wei', 'Ge, Kai', 'Peng, Weiqun', 'Nussenzweig, Michel C', 'Casellas, Rafael', 'Dressler, Gregory R', 'Zhao, Keji', 'Nussenzweig, Andre']","['Daniel JA', 'Santos MA', 'Wang Z', 'Zang C', 'Schwab KR', 'Jankovic M', 'Filsuf D', 'Chen HT', 'Gazumyan A', 'Yamane A', 'Cho YW', 'Sun HW', 'Ge K', 'Peng W', 'Nussenzweig MC', 'Casellas R', 'Dressler GR', 'Zhao K', 'Nussenzweig A']","['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['ZIADK047055-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 AR041149-03/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIADK075003-06/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK047055-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK075003-04/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK047055-02/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA AR041149-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 AR041149-04/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 DK999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'ZIADK075017-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK075003-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA DK075017-03/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100729,United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Paxip1 protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Switch Region', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC3008398,['NIHMS251335'],2010/07/31 06:00,2010/09/03 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['science.1187942 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1187942 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2010 Aug 20;329(5994):917-23. doi: 10.1126/science.1187942.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), deregulation of oncogenic kinases, including Akt, extra-signal-regulated kinase, or IkappaB kinase, is frequently observed, which may potentially inactivate FOXO activity. We therefore investigated the mechanism underlying the regulation of FOXO3a, the only FOXO protein constantly expressed in AML blast cells. We show that in both primary AML samples and in a MV4-11/FOXO3a-GFP cell line, FOXO3a is in a constant inactive state due to its cytoplasmic localization, and that neither PI3K/Akt nor extra-signal-regulated kinase-specific inhibition resulted in its nuclear translocation. In contrast, the anti-Nemo peptide that specifically inhibits IKK activity was found to induce FOXO3a nuclear localization in leukemic cells. Furthermore, an IKK-insensitive FOXO3a protein mutated at S(6)(4)(4) translocated into the nucleus and activated the transcription of the Fas-L and p21(Cip1) genes. This, in turn, inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. These results thus indicate that IKK activity maintains FOXO3a in the cytoplasm and establishes an important role of FOXO3a inactivation in the proliferation and survival of AML cells. The restoration of FOXO3a activity by interacting with its subcellular distribution may thus represent a new attractive therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Park, Sophie', 'Leotoing, Laurent', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Verdier, Frederique', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Green, Alexa S', 'Willems, Lise', 'Agou, Fabrice', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Bismuth, Georges', 'Baud, Veronique', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Chapuis N', 'Park S', 'Leotoing L', 'Tamburini J', 'Verdier F', 'Bardet V', 'Green AS', 'Willems L', 'Agou F', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Bismuth G', 'Baud V', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D']","['Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS (UMR8104), Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100729,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31064-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-260711 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 18;116(20):4240-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-260711.

Importantly, systemic intravenous delivery of nanoliposomal ceramide induced complete remission in the syngeneic Fischer F344 rat model of aggressive NK-LGL leukemia.

The latter finding is related to IL-23-induced up-regulation of miR15a expression and the consequent down-regulation of BCL-2 protein expression in pediatric B-ALL cells.

However, the more limited repertoire and immunogenicity of EBV-encoded proteins in other malignancies such as Hodgkin lymphoma and extranodal natural killer (NK)/T lymphoma has been more challenging to target. The immunosubdominant latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) is considered the optimal target in such Latency II tumors, although data relating to its expression in T/NK malignancies are limited. In addressing the validity of LMP2 as an immunotherapeutic target we found that LMP2-specific effector CD8(+) T cells recognized and killed EBV-positive NK- and T-cell tumor lines, despite an apparent absence of LMP2A protein and barely detectable levels of LMP2 transcripts from the conventional LMP2A and LMP2B promoters. We resolved this paradox by identifying in these lines a novel LMP2 mRNA, initiated from within the EBV terminal repeats and containing downstream, epitope-encoding exons. This same mRNA was also highly expressed in primary (extra-nodal) NK/T lymphoma tissue, with virtually undetectable levels of conventional LMP2A/B transcripts. Expression of this novel transcript in T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases validates LMP2 as an attractive target for cellular immunotherapy and implicates this truncated LMP2 protein in NK- and T-cell lymphomagenesis.

The feasibility of expanding populations of the human NK and CD8(+) T cells by IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complexes was tested. We then measured the cytotoxicity of expanded NK and CD8(+) T cells against tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells. When tested ex vivo, IL-2/IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complexes significantly enhanced NK and CD8(+) T cells expansion, isolated or non-isolated from PBMCs. The effect of IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc was dependent on the presence of IL-2 or IL-15. IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complexes increased NK, CD8(+) T and NKT cells ratio in PBMC and BMMC after 14 days incubation. High level of granzyme B expression was observed in the supernatant of the complexes-treated NK cells. Expanded NK and CD8(+) T cell populations had cytotoxic function against the PC3, LNCaP, K562 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient primary B cell lymphoma. We concluded that IL-2/IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc significantly enhanced NK, CD8(+) T and NKT cells expansion, which possess strong anti-tumor activity. These data support clinical testing IL-2/IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc expanded NK cells in patients with prostate cancer and CLL.","['Wu, Zhongfu', 'Xu, Yibing']","['Wu Z', 'Xu Y']","['Research and Development Department, Zhongying Stem Cell Bioengineering Co., Ltd, Chu Tian Road 88, Binjiang, Hangzhou 310052, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Mol Cell Biol,Journal of molecular cell biology,101503669,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-15 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology', 'Interleukin-15 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['mjq012 [pii]', '10.1093/jmcb/mjq012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Aug;2(4):217-22. doi: 10.1093/jmcb/mjq012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to determine the incidence of lymphoma in patients with melanoma compared with the general population, and to characterise their clinical and pathological features. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with melanoma and lymphoma between January 1992 and December 2007 were identified from the databases of Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) and the Department of Tissue Pathology and Diagnostic Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH). The clinical histories of the patients in the MIA database and pathology reports in the RPAH archives were reviewed. The incidence risk for melanoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was obtained from Australian Cancer Incidence and Mortality registry data. RESULTS: Of 18,226 patients with melanoma, 55 (0.3%) had lymphoma. Lymphoma was diagnosed subsequent to melanoma in 23 (41.8%) patients, prior to melanoma in 7 (12.7%) patients, and concurrently with melanoma in 25 (45.5%) patients. 53 (96.4%) patients developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the most common subtypes being chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (49.1%), follicular lymphoma (23.6%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (16.4%). Two (3.6%) patients developed Hodgkin lymphoma. Melanoma patients had a significantly higher risk of developing NHL than the general population (standardised incidence rate 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant proportion of patients with melanoma develop lymphoma, either synchronously or metachronously. Lymph node specimens from melanoma patients might harbour lymphoma, and might represent the first recognised site of disease. A high index of suspicion for lymphoma when evaluating lymph nodes from patients with melanoma will ensure prompt diagnosis and appropriate management.","['Verwer, Nick', 'Murali, Rajmohan', 'Winstanley, Julie', 'Cooper, Wendy A', 'Stretch, Jonathan R', 'Thompson, John F', 'Scolyer, Richard A']","['Verwer N', 'Murali R', 'Winstanley J', 'Cooper WA', 'Stretch JR', 'Thompson JF', 'Scolyer RA']","['Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100729,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jcp.2010.077768 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2010.077768 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2010 Sep;63(9):777-81. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2010.077768.

Here we present an analysis of two sequence variants of the MET receptor (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) R970C and T992I (also designated R988C and T1010I). Previous reports indicated that these sequence variants are transforming and contribute to oncogenesis. We screened patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, or melanoma, as well as individuals without cancer, and found these variants at low frequencies in most cohorts, including normal individuals. No evidence of increased phosphorylation or transformative capacity by either sequence variant was found. Because small-molecule inhibitors for MET are currently in development, it will be important to distinguish between oncogenic sequence variants and rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms to avoid the use of unnecessary, and potentially toxic, cancer therapy agents.","['Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Fletcher, Luke B', 'Wang, Ellen Q', 'Yang, Wayne F', 'Rutenberg-Schoenberg, Michael L', 'Beadling, Carol', 'Mori, Motomi', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Loriaux, Marc M']","['Tyner JW', 'Fletcher LB', 'Wang EQ', 'Yang WF', 'Rutenberg-Schoenberg ML', 'Beadling C', 'Mori M', 'Heinrich MC', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ', 'Loriaux MM']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA. tynerj@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'RC1 CA146107-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 CA146107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5P50CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC2913476,['NIHMS211280'],2010/07/31 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['70/15/6233 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0429 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;70(15):6233-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0429.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To develop FRET-based biosensors, we used CrkL, the most characteristic substrate of BCR-ABL, and designed a protein in which CrkL is sandwiched between Venus, a variant of YFP, and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, so that CrkL intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosine (Y207) increases FRET efficiency. After evaluation of the properties of this biosensor by comparison with established methods including Western blotting and flow cytometry, BCR-ABL activity and its response to drugs were examined in CML patient cells. RESULTS: After optimization, we obtained a biosensor that possesses higher sensitivity than that of established techniques with respect to measuring BCR-ABL activity and its suppression by imatinib. Thanks to its high sensitivity, this biosensor accurately gauges BCR-ABL activity in relatively small cell numbers and can also detect <1% minor drug-resistant populations within heterogeneous ones. We also noticed that this method enabled us to predict future onset of drug resistance as well as to monitor the disease status during imatinib therapy, using patient cells. CONCLUSION: In consideration of its quick and practical nature, this method is potentially a promising tool for the prediction of both current and future therapeutic responses in individual CML patients, which will be surely beneficial for both patients and clinicians.","['Mizutani, Tatsuaki', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Darmanin, Stephanie', 'Tsuda, Masumi', 'Tanaka, Shinya', 'Tobiume, Minoru', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Ohba, Yusuke']","['Mizutani T', 'Kondo T', 'Darmanin S', 'Tsuda M', 'Tanaka S', 'Tobiume M', 'Asaka M', 'Ohba Y']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiology and Signal Transduction, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Kira-ku, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Luminescent Agents)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Separation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Luminescent Agents', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['16/15/3964 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0548 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;16(15):3964-75. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0548.,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;16(15):3822-4.

It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 and thereafter rapidly became front-line therapy. This study characterized the prevailing chronic myeloid leukemia therapies in the United States and assessed the impact of imatinib on chronic myeloid leukemia survival and mortality rates in the general population. METHODS: Investigators with the National Cancer Institute's Patterns of Care study reviewed medical records and queried physicians regarding therapy for 423 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosed in 2003 who were randomly selected from cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Characteristics associated with the receipt of imatinib were documented, as were survival differences between those who received imatinib and those who did not. Population-based data were used to assess chronic myeloid leukemia survival and mortality rates in time periods before and after the introduction of imatinib. RESULTS: Imatinib was administered to 76% of patients in the Patterns of Care study. Imatinib use was inversely associated with age: 90%, 75%, and 46% for patients ages 20 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and 80 or more years, respectively. Elderly patients who received imatinib survived significantly longer than those who did not. After adjusting for age, imatinib use did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, urban/rural residence, presence of comorbid conditions, or insurance status. Overall, chronic myeloid leukemia survival in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population improved, and mortality in the United States declined dramatically during the period when imatinib became widely available; these improvements diminished with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Age disparities in treatment with imatinib likely contributed to worse survival for many elderly patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Wiggins, Charles L', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Nelson, Harold E', 'Stevens, Jennifer L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Libby, Edward N', 'Hromas, Robert A']","['Wiggins CL', 'Harlan LC', 'Nelson HE', 'Stevens JL', 'Willman CL', 'Libby EN', 'Hromas RA']","['New Mexico Tumor Registry, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['N01-PC-54405/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35137/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35135/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35133/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5UO1 CA88361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093606/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35145/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35138/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35142/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139429-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC54402/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35141/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35139/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL075783/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093606-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA088361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC54404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140422-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075783/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC54405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-54404/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-54402/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35143/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-35136/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'SEER Program', 'Social Class', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC2913144,['NIHMS208511'],2010/07/31 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2009/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9343(10)00387-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 2010 Aug;123(8):764.e1-9. doi: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.03.018.,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To clarify the susceptibility of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) to tumor immunity, sensitivity to recombinant human soluble Fas ligand (rhsFasL) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rhsTRAIL) was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sensitivity to rhsFasL and rhsTRAIL and cell surface expression of their receptors were tested in T-ALL cell lines (n = 7) and patients' samples (n = 17) and compared with those in B-precursor ALL cell lines (n = 30). Expression of components of the death-inducing signaling complex and the TRAIL receptor genes (DR4/DR5), and the methylation status and promoter activity of the DR4/DR5 gene were tested in T-ALL cell lines. RESULTS: T-ALL cell lines showed higher level of Fas expression and higher sensitivity to rhsFasL than did B-precursor ALL cell lines. Despite comparable expression of components of death-inducing signaling complex, cell lines and patients' samples of T-ALL showed TRAIL-resistance associated with low cell surface expression of DR4/DR5. Gene expression of DR4/DR5 in T-ALL cell lines was significantly lower than that in B-precursor ALL cell lines, and the methylation status of the gene promoter in T-ALL cell lines was associated with the gene expression level at least for DR4. The demethylating agent, 5-aza 2'deoxycytidine, upregulated the gene expression of DR4/DR5, but was insufficient for their surface expression due to low basal promoter activity. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to higher sensitivity to FasL, T-ALL showed resistance to TRAIL, which might be responsible for resistance to TRAIL-mediated cellular immunity.","['Akahane, Koshi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Zhang, Xiaochun', 'Hirose, Kinuko', 'Kuroda, Itaru', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Honna, Hiroko', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Nakazawa, Shinpei', 'Endo, Kazushi', 'Kubota, Takeo', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Koyama-Okazaki, Toshiko', 'Sugita, Kanji']","['Akahane K', 'Inukai T', 'Zhang X', 'Hirose K', 'Kuroda I', 'Goi K', 'Honna H', 'Kagami K', 'Nakazawa S', 'Endo K', 'Kubota T', 'Yagita H', 'Koyama-Okazaki T', 'Sugita K']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100727,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2009/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00289-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.06.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Oct;38(10):885-95. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.06.014.

HBV-DNA positive patients (n=12) commenced lamivudine before the initiation of the CT. In HBV-DNA negative patients HBV reactivation was found in 10 patients (55.5%). HBV reactivation was significantly more frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (P=0.008) and in patients receiving rituximab containing chemotherapy regimens (P=0.06). Eight patients (80.0%) responded to antiviral treatment after HBV reactivation. Two CLL patients experienced a flare-up after the withdrawal of antiviral therapy. In HBV-DNA positive patients, HBV reactivation was observed in four patients (33.3%) during lamivudine treatment and in two patients after lamivudine withdrawal.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs modulate cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. We used a specific anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-21) to sensitize leukemic HL60 cells to arabinosylcytosine (Ara-C) by down-regulating miR-21. AMO-miR-21 alone effectively inhibited HL60 cell viability as measured by MTT assays and induced apoptosis as evaluated by flow cytometry, whereas AMO-miR-21 in combination with Ara-C enhanced HL60 cells to Ara-C-sensitivity and promoted Ara-C-induced apoptosis. Levels of miR-21 and its target PDCD4, quantified by real-time PCR, showed that expression of miR-21 was significantly decreased after AMO-miR-21 treatment. PDCD4 as a direct target of miR-21 in leukemic HL60 cells was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our study suggests that AMO-miR-21 significantly sensitizes HL60 cells to Ara-C by inducing apoptosis and these effects of AMO-miR-21 may be partially due to its up-regulation of PDCD4. Therefore, exploiting synergistic effects between AMO-miR-21 and Ara-C might be an effective clinical strategy for leukemia chemotherapy.","['Li, Yumin', 'Zhu, Xuejiao', 'Gu, Jingyi', 'Hu, Haiyan', 'Dong, Dawei', 'Yao, Junlin', 'Lin, Chunyan', 'Fei, Jia']","['Li Y', 'Zhu X', 'Gu J', 'Hu H', 'Dong D', 'Yao J', 'Lin C', 'Fei J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PDCD4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/drug effects"", 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453310X12647083620840 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2010 Aug;15(4):215-21. doi: 10.1179/102453310X12647083620840.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), an angiogenic cytokine, was recently reported in CLL. However, data regarding prognostic significance of Ang-2 in CLL are limited. Therefore, we quantitated Ang-2 mRNA in purified mononuclear cells of 33 untreated CLL patients and compared the transcript levels to traditional as well as modern prognostic factors in patients with CLL (clinical stage, disease course, IgVH mutation status, CD38, and ZAP-70 expression). Elevated Ang-2 mRNA concentrations were detected in 12 cases; 21 patients had very low or undetectable levels of Ang-2 transcript. There was significant association between high Ang-2 mRNA levels and unmutated IgVH genes (n=27, P=0.010) and with CD38 expression (n=32, P=0.011), but not with ZAP-70 expression (n=32, P=0.784), Rai stage (n=33, P=0.305) or stable versus progressive clinical course (n=33, P=0.443). There was a trend towards shorter progression-free survival in patients with high Ang-2 expression; however, it did not reach statistical significance (P=0.090). Our pilot data show that Ang-2 mRNA is differentially expressed in patients with CLL and its increased expression appears to be associated with poor prognostic features. Further studies are needed to confirm the results in a larger patient cohort.","['Vrbacky, F', 'Smolej, L', 'Vroblova, V', 'Pekova, S', 'Hrudkova, M', 'Cervinka, M', 'Pecka, M', 'Krejsek, J', 'Maly, J']","['Vrbacky F', 'Smolej L', 'Vroblova V', 'Pekova S', 'Hrudkova M', 'Cervinka M', 'Pecka M', 'Krejsek J', 'Maly J']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital, Charles University, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. vrbacky@fnhk.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiopoietin-2/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X12583347113898 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2010 Aug;15(4):210-4. doi: 10.1179/102453309X12583347113898.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cure rate of 75-80% can be anticipated with a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracyclines. In Tunisia, the ATRA era began in 1998 with the use, consecutively, of two regimens of a combination of ATRA with anthracycline and cytarabine (APL93), and without cytarabine (LPA99). From 2004, 39 patients with confirmed APL either by t(15;17) or PML/RARA were treated by the PETHEMA LPA 99 trial. The rationale of this protocol by avoiding cytarabine is to reduce death in complete remission (CR) without increasing the incidence of relapse. Thirty-three patients achieved CR (84.6%). The remaining six patients were considered as failure due to early death: three caused by differentiation syndrome (DS) and three died from central nervous system hemorrhage. Baseline blood cell count (WBC) >10 x 10(9)/l (P=0.26) and creatinine >1.4 mg/dl (P=0.42) were not predictive of mortality. DS was observed in 11 patients (30.5%) with a median onset time of 12 days (range: 3-23 days) and median WBC of 29 x 10(9)/L (range: 1.2 x 10(9)-82.7 x 10(9)/l). DS was severe in seven cases, moderate in four, and fatal in three cases. Body mass index > or =30 (P=0.044) and baseline WBC > or =20 x 10(9)/l (P=0.025) are independent predictors of DS. The median follow-up of this study is 36 months. Thirty patients are alive in continuous complete remission; two patients died in CR from septic shock and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome respectively; one patient died 47 months after achieving two relapses. Event free survival from diagnosis was 80% and overall survival was 82%. Our results are quite acceptable and can be improved by reducing mortality rate.","['Jeddi, Ramzi', 'Ghedira, Hela', 'Menif, Samia', 'Ben Neji, Hend', 'Ben Amor, Ramzi', 'Kacem, Karima', 'Aissaoui, Lamia', 'Bouteraa, Walid', 'Abdennebi, Yosr', 'Raihane, Ben Lakhal', 'Gouider, Emna', 'Raouf, Hafsia', 'Hela, Ben Abid', 'Saad, Ali', 'Zaher, Belhadjali', 'Meddeb, Balkis']","['Jeddi R', 'Ghedira H', 'Menif S', 'Ben Neji H', 'Ben Amor R', 'Kacem K', 'Aissaoui L', 'Bouteraa W', 'Abdennebi Y', 'Raihane BL', 'Gouider E', 'Raouf H', 'Hela BA', 'Saad A', 'Zaher B', 'Meddeb B']","['Department of Hematology, Aziza Othmana University Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. ramzi.jed@voila.fr']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'AIDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Tunisia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X12583347114176 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2010 Aug;15(4):204-9. doi: 10.1179/102453309X12583347114176.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In order to define molecular markers for AML, we performed microarray analysis on peripheral blood cells from two M5 AML patients, and selected four differentially expressed genes to validate their expression by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: We have shown that two downregulated genes in AML, those encoding guanine nucleotide-binding protein gamma11 (GNG11) and amphiregulin (AREG), are also downregulated in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. A second gene, that encoding ceruloplasmin (CP), is upregulated in AML but not in B-ALL and T-ALL. The level of expression of these genes varies from one patient to another. CONCLUSION: Since the number of patients studied is limited, further studies are needed with a larger series of patients to evaluate the potential utility of GNG11, AREG and CP as molecular markers for AML subtype classification. Our study is the first to analyze these genes in AML, B-ALL, T-ALL and chronic leukemia (myeloid and lymphoid) patients by RT-PCR.

Univariate analysis showed significant thrombotic risks to be JAK2 V617F (P=0.006), hemoglobin >13 g/dl (P=0.015), and age >55 years (P=0.011). However, in multivariate analysis, only age and hemoglobin were independent risk factors. JAK2 V617F was unrelated to survival or leukemic/myelofibrotic transformation.

There are four main subcategories, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-negative (aCML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U), which also includes the provisional entity, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T). Notably, the morphological features typical of MDS/MPNs are not specific and can be seen in other myeloid neoplasms at presentation or as part of disease progression or transformation. METHODS AND RESULTS: This review presents a laboratory approach to diagnosing MDS/MPNs in adults that allows for the exclusion of other disorders that may be otherwise indistinguishable. Ancillary studies including cytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genetic testing are discussed. CONCLUSION: The most appropriate classification of myeloid neoplasms presenting with hybrid myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative features requires a comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment with careful integration of the morphological, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical characteristics.","['Hall, J', 'Foucar, Kathryn']","['Hall J', 'Foucar K']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87102, USA. kfoucar@salud.unm.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/diagnosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/analysis', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1251 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01251.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Dec;32(6 Pt 2):559-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01251.x.,['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies have shown that cellular metabolism of anthracyclines could play a role in drug resistance. Currently, it is not known what enzyme is responsible for anthracycline metabolism in leukemic cells. AIMS: To study C-13 reduction of DNR to daunorubicinol (DOL) in leukemic cells isolated from patients with AML and to determine the most important enzyme involved. METHODS: Mononuclear blood cells from 25 AML patients were isolated at diagnosis and used in a metabolic assay to determine the % DOL formed. mRNA and western blot analysis were performed on the 2 most likely candidates for anthracycline metabolism; carbonyl reductase 1 (CR1) and aldoketoreductase 1A1 (AKR1A1). DNR and DOL concentrations were determined by HPLC. RESULTS: We found a large interindividual variation (up to 47-fold) in leukemic cell DNR metabolism. The specific CR1 inhibitor zeraleone analogue 5 significantly inhibited DNR metabolism with a mean inhibitory effect of 68 %. No correlation between mRNA levels of the enzymes and metabolism were found. Cellular DNR metabolism correlated significantly with CR1 protein expression, determined by western blot, (p < 0.05, R2 = 0,229) while no significant correlation was found with AKR1A1 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: DNR metabolism in AML cells shows a pronounced interindividual variability. Our results support that CR1 is the most important enzyme for conversion of DNR to DOL in AML cells. This information could in the future be used to genotype CR1 and possibly help to individualise dosing.","['Bogason, Alex', 'Masquelier, Michele', 'Lafolie, Pierre', 'Skogastierna, Cristine', 'Paul, Christer', 'Gruber, Astrid', 'Vitols, Sigurd']","['Bogason A', 'Masquelier M', 'Lafolie P', 'Skogastierna C', 'Paul C', 'Gruber A', 'Vitols S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute/Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Drug Metab Lett,Drug metabolism letters,101313587,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.184 (CBR1 protein, human)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biotransformation', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/DML/E-Pub/00048 [pii]', '10.2174/187231210792928260 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Lett. 2010 Dec;4(4):228-32. doi: 10.2174/187231210792928260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the authors first determined whether genotypes of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters--glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, GSTM1 positive/null, GSTT1 positive/null and GSTP1 A313G, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) G80A, and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) C421A--were associated with hepatotoxicity for 24 patients, no significant difference was detected for genotype and allelic frequencies between the patients with and those without severe treatment-related hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the authors explored potential candidate polymorphisms associated with hepatotoxicity using the Illumina Infinium HumanHap300, encompassing more than 318,000 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for 8 of 24 patients with or without severe hepatotoxicity. Genome-wide genotyping uncovered a total of 28 candidate SNPs. rs1966862, in Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), was the most significant of the candidates, and the genotypes of rs13424027 (PARD3B), rs1156304 (KCNIP4), rs10255262 (SLC13A1), rs7403531 (RASGRP1), and rs381423 (unidentified gene) were also significantly associated with severe hepatotoxicity.

The FLT3 mutation status may differ at diagnosis and relapse, suggesting a potential role in chemoresistance, yet few reports have addressed the cytogenetic and pathologic correlates of FLT3 mutations in relapsed AML. OBJECTIVES: To determine FLT3 mutations at diagnosis and relapse in a cohort of adult patients with chemoresistant AML and to correlate mutation status with multiple variables. DESIGN: We retrospectively determined FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations in 50 diagnosis/relapse pairs. We correlated FLT3 status with karyotype, World Health Organization 2008 subtype, white blood cell count, biopsy cellularity, blast percentage, and the presence of invaginated (""cuplike"") blast nuclei. RESULTS: In 11 of 50 patients (22%) the FLT3 mutation status differed at relapse and diagnosis, with a trend toward gain of FLT3/ITD (n = 7) and loss of FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (n = 5) mutations. FLT3-mutated AMLs correlated with the World Health Organization 2008 subtype, AML, not otherwise specified, hyperproliferative features at diagnosis and relapse, and cytogenetic evolution. FLT3-wild type AMLs correlated with the subtype AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and frequently had adverse presentation karyotypes. Cuplike blast morphology was associated with FLT3/ITD+ status and with high mutation levels. Four of 7 patients with relapse-only FLT3/ITD mutations exhibited cuplike blasts at relapse after being noncuplike at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to well-known correlates in pretreatment specimens, FLT3 mutation status has pathologic and cytogenetic significance at relapse. A shift to cuplike blast morphology at relapse may herald emergence of a previously undetected FLT3/ITD mutation.","['McCormick, Stanley R', 'McCormick, Matthew J', 'Grutkoski, Patricia S', 'Ducker, Gregory S', 'Banerji, Nilanjana', 'Higgins, Rodney R', 'Mendiola, John R', 'Reinartz, John J']","['McCormick SR', 'McCormick MJ', 'Grutkoski PS', 'Ducker GS', 'Banerji N', 'Higgins RR', 'Mendiola JR', 'Reinartz JJ']","['Department of Pathology, United Hospital, St Paul, MN 55102, USA. stan.mccormick@allina.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2010/07/31 06:00,2010/08/27 06:00,['2010/07/31 06:00'],"['2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1043/2009-0292-OA.1 [pii]', '10.5858/2009-0292-OA.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2010 Aug;134(8):1143-51. doi: 10.5858/2009-0292-OA.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to explore the cytoprotection of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) against hypoxia and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and the possible mechanisms in rat MSCs. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining and flow cytometric analysis with annexin V/PI staining. The gene expression of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, total-ERK, phospho-ERK, total-Akt, phospho-Akt, and Hsp90 were detected by Western blot. The production of nitric oxide was measured by spectrophotometric assay. Hsp90 improves MSC viability and protects MSCs against apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and hypoxia. The protective role of Hsp90 not only elevates Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xL/Bax expression and attenuates cleaved caspase-3 expression via down-regulating membrane TLR-4 and ErbB2 receptors and then activating their downstream PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, but also enhances the paracrine effect of MSCs. These findings demonstrated a novel and effective treatment strategy against MSC apoptosis in cell transplantation.","['Gao, Feng', 'Hu, Xin-yang', 'Xie, Xiao-jie', 'Xu, Qi-yuan', 'Wang, Ya-ping', 'Liu, Xian-bao', 'Xiang, Mei-xiang', 'Sun, Yong', 'Wang, Jian-an']","['Gao F', 'Hu XY', 'Xie XJ', 'Xu QY', 'Wang YP', 'Liu XB', 'Xiang MX', 'Sun Y', 'Wang JA']","['Department of Cardiology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,Journal of Zhejiang University.

NFkappaB-dependent genes are involved in antiapoptosis, cell proliferation and metastasis and are responsible for survival and proliferation of tumors. However, the mechanisms of NFkappaB activity in CLL still need to be elucidated. Previously, we identified translocations in a region on chromosome 6q that encodes tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3, which is a key player in negative feedback loop regulation of NFkappaB. Inactivation of this ubiquitin-editing enzyme is involved in immunopathologies and in tumorigenesis. Frequent mutations in the A20 locus--leading to sustained NFkappaB activity--could be shown to play a dominant role in development of different B-cell malignancies. To check if A20 is involved in upregulation of NFkappaB activity in CLL, we sequenced Exons 2-9 of the A20 gene in 55 CLL DNA samples. Furthermore, we determined the methylation status of the promoter region in 63 CLL DNA samples and compared to 10 control DNAs of B cells from healthy donors. Contrary to reports from other B-cell malignancies, the A20 region showed neither mutations nor aberrant DNA methylation. Moreover, its expression could be confirmed by immunoblotting and showing comparable results to healthy B cells. These results indicate that malignant development in CLL differs from most of other B-cell malignancies, which show frequent inactivation of A20.","['Frenzel, Lukas P', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Plume, Nadine', 'Schwamb, Janine', 'Konermann, Carolin', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Claasen, Julia', 'Brinker, Reinhild', 'Wollnik, Bernd', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Frenzel LP', 'Claus R', 'Plume N', 'Schwamb J', 'Konermann C', 'Pallasch CP', 'Claasen J', 'Brinker R', 'Wollnik B', 'Plass C', 'Wendtner CM']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

Complete records from 1037 CLL patients were retrospectively collected to estimate OS and time to treatment (TTT). Cox models were used to test the independence of age, beta-2-microglobulin, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), sex, Rai stage and number of involved lymph node regions (LNR). Accuracy of prognostic models was tested with the concordance index (c-index). Median follow-up was 5.5 years, with 151 deaths and 475 treated patients. Median OS was not reached (65% survival rate at 13.9 years), median TTT was 6 years. We confirmed the ability of the prognostic score to predict OS and TTT in three risk groups, with results comparable with those reported in the original report. However, ALC and Rai stage were not independent predictors, whereas the Binet staging system, which incorporates LNR variable, showed independent predictive power; furthermore, both 5- and 10-year OS estimates from nomogram were lower compared to real data. When separately analysed, the impact of therapy on OS was not selected as independent predictor of OS in our series. According to these results, we proposed a simpler four-variable model (age, sex, Binet staging, beta-2-microglobulin) and a new nomogram. This model had a c-index of 0.78 versus 0.76 of the six-variable model (p = 0.043), showing better predictive accuracy.

In the present investigation, we compared the cytotoxicity of the chalcone flavonoide, isoliquiritigenin (ISL), with that of doxorubicin (DOX) and methotrexate (MTX) in five T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cell lines (Jurkat, J-Jhan, J16, HUT78 and Karpas 45). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms which determine the response of T-ALL cells towards ISL, DOX and MTX, we applied array-based matrix comparative genomic hybridisation and microarray-based mRNA expression profiling and compared the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of the cell lines with their 50% inhibition (IC(50)) values for these three drugs. The IC(50) values for ISL did not correlate with those for DOX or MTX, indicating that ISL was still active in DOX- or MTX-unresponsive cell lines. Likewise, the genomic imbalances of chromosomal clones and mRNA expression profile significantly correlating with IC(50) values for ISL were different from thoses correlating with IC(50) values for DOX and MTX. In conclusion, ISL represents a cytotoxic natural product with activity towards T-ALL cell lines. There was no cross-resistance between ISL and DOX or MTX, and the genomic and transcriptomic profiles pointed to different molecular modes of action of ISL as compared to DOX and MTX, indicating that ISL may be a valuable adjunct for cancer therapy to treat otherwise drug-resistant tumours.","['Youns, Mahmoud', 'Fu, Yu-Jie', 'Zu, Yuan-Gang', 'Kramer, Anne', 'Konkimalla, V Badireenath', 'Radlwimmer, Bernhard', 'Sultmann, Holger', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Youns M', 'Fu YJ', 'Zu YG', 'Kramer A', 'Konkimalla VB', 'Radlwimmer B', 'Sultmann H', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100729,Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'B9CTI9GB8F (isoliquiritigenin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Pharmacogenetics/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,,2010/07/30 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00210-010-0541-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2010 Sep;382(3):221-34. doi: 10.1007/s00210-010-0541-6.

IFN induces CCR in part by increasing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for PR1, the HLA-A2-restricted 9-mer peptide from proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase, but it is unknown how CCR persists after IFN is stopped. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We reasoned that PR1-CTL persist and mediate CML-specific immunity in patients that maintain CCR after IFN withdrawal. We found that PR1-CTL were increased in peripheral blood of 7/7 HLA-A2+ patients during unmaintained CCR from 3 to 88 months after IFN withdrawal, as compared to no detectable PR1-CTL in 2/2 IFN-treated CML patients not in CCR. Unprimed PR1-CTL secreted IFNgamma and were predominantly CD45RA+/-CD28+CCR7+CD57-, consistent with functional naive and central memory (CM) T cells. Similarly, following stimulation, proliferation occurred predominantly in CM PR1-CTL, consistent with long-term immunity sustained by self-renewing CM T cells. PR1-CTL were functionally anergic in one patient 6 months prior to cytogenetic relapse at 26 months after IFN withdrawal, and in three relapsed patients PR1-CTL were undetectable but re-emerged 3-6 months after starting imatinib. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that IFN elicits CML-specific CM CTL that may contribute to continuous CCR after IFN withdrawal and suggest a role for T cell immune therapy with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a strategy to prolong CR in CML.","['Kanodia, Shreya', 'Wieder, Eric', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Kanodia S', 'Wieder E', 'Lu S', 'Talpaz M', 'Alatrash G', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas M.

Unlike many western studies that have targeted survivors of ALL, we aimed to bring out the cognitive outcome after initiation of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cognitive functions of 19 patients diagnosed to have ALL were assessed using standardized tests after induction chemotherapy, and periodically thereafter following the second course of treatment comprising central nervous system-directed radiotherapy, and chemotherapy using intrathecal methotrexate. RESULTS: The study found a statistically significant decline in the intelligence quotient and a deficit in the cognitive function of analytical reasoning. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study supports findings of an earlier Indian study and many studies conducted in the west. Since the life expectancy of these children has increased and most of them have long-term survival, and even cure, we suggest that identifying and managing children with cognitive difficulties are important in the rehabilitation of these children.","['Abraham, Anna', 'Appaji, L']","['Abraham A', 'Appaji L']","['Clinical Psychology Unit, Kidwai Memorial, Institute of Oncology (KMIO), Bangalore, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,PMC2902209,,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2010/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4103/0971-5851.56330 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2009 Jan;30(1):14-9. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.56330.,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'cognitive functions']",,,

The present study addresses this problem from a transcriptional standpoint, analyzing the expression of membrane protein genes--the Membranome--in primary tumors and immortalized in-vitro cultured tumor cells. 409 human samples, deriving from ten independent studies, were analyzed. These comprise normal tissues, primary tumors and tumor derived cell lines deriving from eight different tissues: brain, breast, colon, kidney, leukemia, lung, melanoma, and ovary. We demonstrated that the Membranome has greater power than the remainder of the transcriptome when used as input for the automatic classification of tumor samples. This feature is maintained in tumor derived cell lines. In most cases primary tumors show maximal similarity in Membranome expression with cell lines of same tissue origin. Differences in Membranome expression between tumors and cell lines were analyzed also at the pathway level and biological themes were identified that were differentially regulated in the two settings. Moreover, by including normal samples in the analysis, we quantified the degree to which cell lines retain the Membranome up- and down-regulations observed in primary tumors with respect to their normal counterparts. We showed that most of the Membranome up-regulations observed in primary tumors are lost in the in-vitro cultured cells. Conversely, the majority of Membranome genes down-regulated upon tumor transformation maintain lower expression levels also in the cell lines. This study points towards a central role of Membranome genes in the definition of the tumor phenotype. The comparative analysis of primary tumors and cell lines identifies the limits of cell lines as a model for the study of cancer-related processes mediated by the cell surface. Results presented allow for a more rational use of the cell lines as a model of cancer.","['Uva, Paolo', 'Lahm, Armin', 'Sbardellati, Andrea', 'Grigoriadis, Anita', 'Tutt, Andrew', 'de Rinaldis, Emanuele']","['Uva P', 'Lahm A', 'Sbardellati A', 'Grigoriadis A', 'Tutt A', 'de Rinaldis E']","['CRS4 Bioinformatics Laboratory, Parco Scientifico e Tecnologico POLARIS, Pula, Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100723,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",PMC2909215,,2010/07/30 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0011742 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jul 23;5(7):e11742. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011742.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As aberrant responses to microenvironmental signals are a feature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), O-GlcNAcylated protein levels were measured in primary CLL cells. In contrast to normal circulating and tonsillar B cells, CLL cells expressed high levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins, including p53, c-myc and Akt. O-GlcNAcylation in CLL cells increased following activation with cytokines and through toll-like receptors (TLRs), or after loading with hexosamine pathway substrates. However, high baseline O-GlcNAc levels were associated with impaired signaling responses to TLR agonists, chemotherapeutic agents, B cell receptor crosslinking and mitogens. Indolent and aggressive clinical behavior of CLL cells were found to correlate with higher and lower O-GlcNAc levels, respectively. These findings suggest that intracellular O-GlcNAcylation is associated with the pathogenesis of CLL, which could potentially have therapeutic implications.","['Shi, Y', 'Tomic, J', 'Wen, F', 'Shaha, S', 'Bahlo, A', 'Harrison, R', 'Dennis, J W', 'Williams, R', 'Gross, B J', 'Walker, S', 'Zuccolo, J', 'Deans, J P', 'Hart, G W', 'Spaner, D E']","['Shi Y', 'Tomic J', 'Wen F', 'Shaha S', 'Bahlo A', 'Harrison R', 'Dennis JW', 'Williams R', 'Gross BJ', 'Walker S', 'Zuccolo J', 'Deans JP', 'Hart GW', 'Spaner DE']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['MOP-43938/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'R01 DK61671/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '15095/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'R01 DK061671/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP-79405/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'R01CA42486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '190633/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'R03 MH076518/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100729,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/*metabolism', 'Acylation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4361888,['NIHMS656046'],2010/07/30 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010152 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.152 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1588-98. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.152.

An aberrant immunophenotype could be detected in 94% of patients. MRD levels after the first course of chemotherapy predicted for clinical outcome: 3-year relapse-free survival was 85%+/-8% (s.e.) for MRD-negative patients (MRD<0.1%), 64%+/-10% for MRD-low-positive patients (0.1%<or=MRD<0.5%) and only 14+/-9% for MRD-high-positive patients (MRD>or=0.5%; P<0.001), whereas overall survival was 95%+/-5%, 70%+/-10% and 40%+/-13%, respectively, (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis allowing for age, karyotype, FLT3-internal tandem duplications and white blood cell count at diagnosis showed that MRD after the first course of chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor. Although comparison of paired diagnosis-relapse samples (n=23) showed immunophenotypic shifts in 91% of cases, this did not hamper MRD analysis. In conclusion, flowcytometric MRD detection is possible in children with AML.

We show in our current study that the LKB1/AMPK/TSC tumor suppressor axis is functional in AML and can be activated by the biguanide molecule metformin, resulting in a specific inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) catalytic activity. This induces a multisite dephosphorylation of the key translation regulator, 4E-BP1, which markedly inhibits the initiation step of mRNA translation. Consequently, metformin reduces the recruitment of mRNA molecules encoding oncogenic proteins to the polysomes, resulting in a strong antileukemic activity against primary AML cells while sparing normal hematopoiesis ex vivo and significantly reducing the growth of AML cells in nude mice. The induction of the LKB1/AMPK tumor-suppressor pathway thus represents a promising new strategy for AML therapy.","['Green, Alexa S', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Maciel, Thiago Trovati', 'Willems, Lise', 'Lambert, Mireille', 'Arnoult, Christophe', 'Boyer, Olivier', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Park, Sophie', 'Foretz, Marc', 'Viollet, Benoit', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Moura, Ivan Cruz', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Tamburini, Jerome']","['Green AS', 'Chapuis N', 'Maciel TT', 'Willems L', 'Lambert M', 'Arnoult C', 'Boyer O', 'Bardet V', 'Park S', 'Foretz M', 'Viollet B', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Hermine O', 'Moura IC', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D', 'Tamburini J']","['Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS (UMR8104), Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100728,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK11 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biocatalysis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Metformin/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polyribosomes/drug effects/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,,2010/07/30 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31066-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-269837 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 18;116(20):4262-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-269837.

However, animal models have been missing that allow evaluation of donor-patient-specific graft-versus-leukemia effects. Thus, we sought to establish a patient-tailored humanized mouse model that would result in long-term engraftment of various lymphocytic lineages and would serve as a donor-specific surrogate. Following transfer of donor-derived peripheral blood stem cells into NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice with supplementation of human IL-7, we could demonstrate robust engraftment and multilineage differentiation comparable to earlier studies using cord blood stem cells. Phenotypical and functional analyses of lymphoid lineages revealed that >20 wk posthematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the majority of T lymphocytes consisted of memory-type CD4(+) T cells capable of inducing specific immune functions, whereas CD8(+) T cells were only present in low numbers. Analysis of NSG-derived NK cells revealed the expression of constitutively activated CD56(bright)CD16(-) killer Ig-like receptor(negative) NK cells that exhibited functional impairments. Thus, the data presented in this study demonstrate that humanized NSG mice can be successfully used to develop a xenotransplantation model that might allow patient-tailored treatment strategies in the future, but also highlight the need to improve this model, for example, by coadministration of differentiation-promoting cytokines and induction of human MHC molecules to complement existing deficiencies in NK and CD8(+) T cell development.","['Andre, Maya C', 'Erbacher, Annika', 'Gille, Christian', 'Schmauke, Vanessa', 'Goecke, Barbara', 'Hohberger, Alexander', 'Mang, Philippa', 'Wilhelm, Ayline', 'Mueller, Ingo', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Lang, Peter', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Hartwig, Udo F']","['Andre MC', 'Erbacher A', 'Gille C', 'Schmauke V', 'Goecke B', 'Hohberger A', 'Mang P', 'Wilhelm A', 'Mueller I', 'Herr W', 'Lang P', 'Handgretinger R', 'Hartwig UF']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100728,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Death/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/*deficiency/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*immunology/methods/pathology']",,,2010/07/30 06:00,2010/10/27 06:00,['2010/07/30 06:00'],"['2010/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000583 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000583 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Sep 1;185(5):2710-20. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000583.

Several diagnostic methods have been proposed using flow cytometry to identify BCR/ABL1(+) B-ALL. METHODS: We evaluated expression of the myeloid antigen CD66c by flow cytometry in B-ALL. We studied 94 patients with B-ALL. The t(9;22)(q34;q11) or BCR/ABL1 rearrangement was detected by cytogenetic analysis or RT/PCR. Myeloid antigens CD66c, CD13, CD33, CD117, Myeloperoxidase, CD15 and CD65 were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Of these 94 cases, 17 (18%) cases displayed BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangements and 38 (40%) cases were CD66c positive. CD66c was the most common myeloid antigen expressed on malignant lymphoblasts. Its expression was correlated with BCR/ABL1 rearrangements (P = 0.0001): sensitivity 82%, specificity 69%, positive predictive value 37% and negative predictive value 95%. Co-expression of CD66c(+) CD13(+) was more frequent in BCR/ABL1(+) B-ALL (29%) than BCR/ABL1(-) cases (4%) (P = 0.0044). Some BCR/ABL1(-) B-ALL cases (including hyperdiploid or cases with normal karyotype) were CD66c positive (31%). CONCLUSION: CD66c expression is correlated, but not specifically, with BCR/ABL1 rearrangement. It would seem better to interpret the absence of CD66c expression with a lack of BCR/ABL1 rearrangement.

METHODS: A total of 13,203 NHL patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were diagnosed from 1992 through 2002. Patients were followed from their initial chemotherapy date until the date they were diagnosed with t-MDS/AML, death, or last follow-up (October 31, 2006), whichever occurred first. RESULTS: Overall, 40% (n = 5266) of patients received CSF. During the follow-up period (median follow-up, 2.9 years [range, 1-14.7 years]), 272 (5.2%) patients who were treated with CSF developed t-MDS/AML, compared with 230 (2.9%) patients who did not (P < .0001, log-rank test). The 5-year incidence of t-MDS/AML for patients receiving CSF was 14.1 per 1000 person-years compared with 8.3 per 1000 person-years for patients not receiving CSF. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for gender, histology, stage, comorbidities, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy agent, CSF use was found to be independently associated with a 53% increased risk of t-MDS/AML (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.26-1.84). The observed association between CSF use and t-MDS/AML persisted across histologic subgroups (ie, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and others). Patients who received both CSF and antimetabolite chemotherapy were found to have a 2.5-fold increased risk of t-MDS/AML (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.91-3.26) compared with patients who received neither agent. CONCLUSIONS: The current study, which to our knowledge is the first large population-based study published to date, demonstrated that the administration of CSF among elderly NHL patients receiving chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of t-MDS/AML, although the absolute risk was low.","['Gruschkus, Stephen K', 'Lairson, David', 'Dunn, J Kay', 'Risser, Jan', 'Du, Xianglin L']","['Gruschkus SK', 'Lairson D', 'Dunn JK', 'Risser J', 'Du XL']","['University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HS016743/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', 'R01-HS016743/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*adverse effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk', 'SEER Program']",PMC6300149,['NIHMS218171'],2010/07/29 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25525 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Nov 15;116(22):5279-89. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25525.,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early intensification of treatment for AML using timed sequential therapy (TST) has been proposed as a means of improving the survival outcome in children. The Children's Cancer Group demonstrated that children with AML who were randomized to receive 2 courses of daunorubicin, cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and dexamethasone (the DCTER regimen) given 10 days apart had an improved event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (42% +/- 7% and 55% +/- 9%, respectively, at 2 years). Reports have suggested an improved outcome in adult patients with AML using TST (at the cost of increased toxicity). The current study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the intensively timed DCTER regimen for non-core-binding factor AML in adult patients aged <50 years. METHODS: Between February 2004 and August 2005, 61 patients received this timed sequential induction regimen. Their outcomes were compared with matched historical patients treated with the combination of idarubicin and cytarabine (IA). RESULTS: The median follow-up for surviving patients was 67 months (range, 35-85 months). The timed sequential DCTER regimen had a lower complete remission (CR) rate when compared with the IA combination,, (71% vs 80%, respectively), but this appeared to be counterbalanced by a higher long-term leukemia-free survival rate using the intensified regimen (48% vs 30%, respectively) in patients who achieved a CR (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: The intensively timed regimen of DCTER was found to induce durable remissions in adult patients with AML, including those patients with high-risk disease. The identification of patients who would potentially benefit from such an intensive regimen may justify the higher early risk of early treatment failure that was found to accompany the intensified DCTER regimen in selected patients.","['Rytting, Michael', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Ouzounian, Souzanne', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Rytting M', 'Ravandi F', 'Estey E', 'Cortes J', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jeha S', 'Ouzounian S', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: A 30-item multiple-choice questionnaire was administered to 435 hematologists and oncohematologists in 16 Latin American countries. Physicians self-reported their diagnostic, therapeutic, and disease management strategies. RESULTS: Imatinib is available as initial therapy to 92% of physicians, and 42% of physicians have access to both second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Standard-dose imatinib is the preferred initial therapy for most patients, but 20% would manage a young patient initially with an allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor, and 10% would only offer hydroxyurea to an elderly patient. Seventy-two percent of responders perform routine cytogenetic analysis for monitoring patients on therapy, and 59% routinely use quantitative polymerase chain reaction. For patients who fail imatinib therapy, 61% would increase the dose of imatinib before considering change to a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, except for patients aged 60 years, for whom a switch to a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor was the preferred choice. CONCLUSIONS: The answers to this survey provide insight into the management of patients with CML in Latin America. Some deviations from current recommendations were identified. Understanding the treatment patterns of patients with CML in broad population studies is important to identify needs and improve patient care.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'De Souza, Carmino', 'Ayala-Sanchez, Manuel', 'Bendit, Israel', 'Best-Aguilera, Carlos', 'Enrico, Alicia', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Pagnano, Katia', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Meillon, Luis']","['Cortes J', 'De Souza C', 'Ayala-Sanchez M', 'Bendit I', 'Best-Aguilera C', 'Enrico A', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Pagnano K', 'Pasquini R', 'Meillon L']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

There are few previous descriptions that this cell population can be qualitatively or quantitatively deficient in CLL patients. In the present study we investigated the clinical value of CD3+/CD16+ CD56+ cells as predictors of disease progression. We assessed the frequencies of CD3+/CD16+CD56+ cells by the flow cytometry in a group of 300 CLL patients. The percentage of CD3+/CD16+CD56+ cell population expressed as the percentage of CD3+ lymphocyte compartment showed an inverse correlation with ZAP-70 and CD38. Additionally, the CD3+/CD16+CD56+ showed an inverse correlation with LPL/ADAM29 ratio. Likewise, the ability of these cells to cytokine expression correlated with ZAP-70 expression. A positive correlation between percentage CD3+/CD16+CD56+ cells and TFS was found. The decreased percentage of these cells was associated with higher death risk in CLL patients. Furthermore, the percentage of CD3+/CD16+CD56+ cells was significantly decreased in patients who showed progression of disease.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a family of retinoids, is an internal ligand of RAR and well known as a useful differentiation inducer to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA therapy is now established as an initial treatment for APL. Recently, to improve therapeutic potency and reduce adverse effects of ATRA, a novel synthetic selective agonist for RARalpha and beta, Am80, was developed and applied to APL treatment. In this study, we tested whether Am80 was capable of inducing neuronal differentiation in a human neuroblastoma cell line, NH-12 and compared the differentiation effects between Am80 and ATRA. Morphological studies demonstrated that Am80 induced more potent neurite outgrowth and also proved lesser cell toxicity than ATRA. Am80 up-regulated the expression of tropomyosin-related kinase B as well as ATRA. Moreover, Am80 increased the expression of the neuronal marker, growth-associated protein 43. These findings suggest that Am80 induces neuronal differentiation to a greater extent than ATRA and thus may help establishing therapeutic strategies against neuronal degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.","['Shiohira, Hideo', 'Kitaoka, Akira', 'Shirasawa, Hiromi', 'Enjoji, Munechika', 'Nakashima, Manabu']","['Shiohira H', 'Kitaoka A', 'Shirasawa H', 'Enjoji M', 'Nakashima M']","['Department of Immunological and Molecular Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Fukuoka University, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects', 'GAP-43 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2010 Sep;26(3):393-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN gained the distinction of being the first recombinant cytokine to be licensed in the USA for the treatment of a malignancy in 1986, with the approval of IFN-alpha2a (Hoffman-La Roche) and IFN-alpha2b (Schering-Plough) for the treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia. In addition to this application, other approved antitumor applications for IFN-alpha2a are AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and other approved antitumor applications for IFN-alpha2b are Malignant Melanoma, Follicular Lymphoma, and AIDS-related Kapoisi's Sarcoma. In the ensuing years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted to establish the mechanisms of the induction and action of IFN's anti-tumor activity. These include identifying the role of Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) as a key factor in eliciting the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha as well as identifying genes induced by IFN that are involved in recognition of tumor cells. Recent studies also show that IFN-activated human monocytes can be used to achieve >95% eradication of select tumor cells. The signaling pathways by which IFN induces apoptosis can vary. IFN treatment induces the tumor suppressor gene p53, which plays a role in apoptosis for some tumors, but it is not essential for the apoptotic response. IFN-alpha also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is associated with cell survival. Downstream of PI3K is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which, in conjunction with PI3K, may act in signaling induced by growth factors after IFN treatment. This paper will explore the mechanisms by which IFN acts to elicit its antiproliferative effects and more closely examine the clinical applications for the anti-tumor potential of IFN.","['Bekisz, Joseph', 'Baron, Samuel', 'Balinsky, Corey', 'Morrow, Angel', 'Zoon, Kathryn C']","['Bekisz J', 'Baron S', 'Balinsky C', 'Morrow A', 'Zoon KC']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Z99 AI999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,PMC2907165,['NIHMS199733'],2010/07/29 06:00,2010/07/29 06:01,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3390/ph3040994 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2010 Mar 30;3(4):994-1015. doi: 10.3390/ph3040994.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improved experimental models are beginning to uncover a less rigid structure to CSC biology, in which the concepts of functional plasticity and clonal evolution must be incorporated into the traditional models. Slowly the genetic programmes and biological processes underlying stem cell biology are being elucidated, opening the door to the development of drugs targeting the CSC. The aim of ongoing research to understand CSCs is to develop novel stem cell-directed treatments, which will reduce therapy resistance, relapse and the toxicity associated with current, non-selective agents.","['Bomken, S', 'Fiser, K', 'Heidenreich, O', 'Vormoor, J']","['Bomken S', 'Fiser K', 'Heidenreich O', 'Vormoor J']","[""Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Paul O'Gorman Building, Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK.""]",['eng'],['G0802259/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100727,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Research']",PMC2939794,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['6605821 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605821 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Aug 10;103(4):439-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605821.

Cord blood (CB) is another potentially rich source of NK cells for adoptive immune therapy after stem cell transplantation. Tightly regulated receptor signaling between NK cells and susceptible tumor cells is essential for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, despite expressing normal surface activating and inhibitory NK receptors, CB-derived NK cells have poor cytolytic activity. In this study, we investigate the cellular mechanism and demonstrate that unmanipulated CB-NK cells exhibit an impaired ability to form F-actin immunologic synapses with target leukemia cells compared with peripheral blood-derived NK cells. In addition, there was reduced recruitment of the activating receptor CD2, integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1, and the cytolytic molecule perforin to the CB-NK synapse site. Exvivo interleukin (IL)-2 expansion of CB-NK cells enhanced lytic synapse formation including CD2 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 polarization and activity. Furthermore, the acquired antileukemic function of IL-2-expanded CB-NK cells was validated using a nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient IL-2 receptor common gamma-chain null mouse model. We believe our results provide important mechanistic insights for the potential use of IL-2-expanded CB-derived NK cells for adoptive immune therapy in leukemia.","['Xing, Dongxia', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Gribben, John G', 'Decker, William K', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Li, Sufang', 'Robinson, Simon N', 'Yang, Hong', 'Steiner, David', 'Shah, Nina', 'McMannis, John D', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Bollard, Catherine M']","['Xing D', 'Ramsay AG', 'Gribben JG', 'Decker WK', 'Burks JK', 'Munsell M', 'Li S', 'Robinson SN', 'Yang H', 'Steiner D', 'Shah N', 'McMannis JD', 'Champlin RE', 'Hosing C', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Shpall EJ', 'Bollard CM']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA061508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA061508-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL108945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL108945-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CD2 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses/drug effects/genetics/immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Perforin/metabolism', 'Receptor Aggregation/drug effects/genetics/immunology']",PMC3530422,['NIHMS319314'],2010/07/29 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181e475e9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2010 Sep;33(7):684-96. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181e475e9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mature sperm contains isoform II; however, oocyte contains transcript isoforms I, II, and possibly other unknown isoforms of PML. This indicates that the mature gametes may carry the transcripts to the newly created embryo. We also show that sperm and oocyte cells do not contain PML nuclear bodies. We find that the first appearance of PML nuclear bodies is in the 2-cell-stage mouse embryo. Appearance of PML nuclear bodies in the 2-cell-stage embryo may correspond to the major transcriptional activity of the embryonic genome.

METHODS: Micafungin was administered for sustained fever (>38.4 degrees C) on days 3-5 following the initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy. The overall success rate and side effects were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and lymphoma were enrolled in the study. The overall success rate of micafungin was 61.7% (29/47). A total of 3 patients (6.4%) experienced grade 3/4 elevations in their aspartate aminotransferase levels, and 10 patients (21%) experienced grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia, 9 of which resolved. Four patients died of septic shock. Younger patients (<50 years) and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia exhibited a better response to micafungin than other patients. Patients that were less profoundly neutropenic (>/=0.05 x 10(9)/l) also had a better response to micafungin, as did the patients who recovered from their fever or neutropenia.

Among patients transplanted in CR1, relapse rates were significantly higher in related allo-SCT compared with unrelated allo-SCT, and multivariate analysis demonstrated that less than 6 months from diagnosis to allo-SCT alone was associated with relapse. On the other hand, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was significantly higher in unrelated allo-SCT compared with related allo-SCT, and multivariate analysis demonstrated that 10 months or longer from diagnosis to allo-SCT, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, and abnormal karyotype were associated with NRM. In conclusion, our study showed comparable survival rates but different relapse rates, NRM rates, and risk factors between related and unrelated allo-SCTs. After a close consideration of these factors, the outcome of allo-SCT for adult Ph(-) ALL in CR1 could be improved.","['Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Iida, Hiroatsu', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Kobayashi, Naoki', 'Kasai, Masanobu', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Yoshida, Takashi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Kawa, Keisei', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Miyamura, Koichi']","['Nishiwaki S', 'Inamoto Y', 'Sakamaki H', 'Kurokawa M', 'Iida H', 'Ogawa H', 'Fukuda T', 'Ozawa Y', 'Kobayashi N', 'Kasai M', 'Mori T', 'Iwato K', 'Yoshida T', 'Onizuka M', 'Kawa K', 'Morishima Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Atsuta Y', 'Miyamura K']","['Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan. n-3104@tf7.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100727,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31078-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-269571 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 18;116(20):4368-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-269571.

HAEMACARE classified HMs into groupings consistent with the latest World Health Organization classification and useful for epidemiologic and public health purposes. We present crude, age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates for European HMs according to these groupings, estimated from 66,371 lymphoid malignancies (LMs) and 21,796 myeloid malignancies (MMs) registered in 2000-2002 by 44 European cancer registries, grouped into 5 regions. Age-standardized incidence rates were 24.5 (per 100,000) for LMs and 7.55 for MMs. The commonest LMs were plasma cell neoplasms (4.62), small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphatic leukemia (3.79), diffuse B-cell lymphoma (3.13), and Hodgkin lymphoma (2.41). The commonest MMs were acute myeloid leukemia (2.96), other myeloproliferative neoplasms (1.76), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.24). Unknown morphology LMs were commonest in Northern Europe (7.53); unknown morphology MMs were commonest in Southern Europe (0.73). Overall incidence was lowest in Eastern Europe and lower in women than in men. For most LMs, incidence was highest in Southern Europe; for MMs incidence was highest in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Differences in diagnostic and registration criteria are an important cause of incidence variation; however, different distribution of HM risk factors also contributes.

A clinical study of AICAR is currently being performed in patients with this disease. Here, we have analyzed the mechanisms involved in AICAR-induced apoptosis in CLL cells in which it activates its only well-known molecular target, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, AMPK activation with phenformin or A-769662 failed to induce apoptosis in CLL cells and AICAR also potently induced apoptosis in B lymphocytes from Ampkalpha1(-/-) mice, demonstrating an AMPK-independent mechanism of cell death. Importantly, AICAR induced apoptosis irrespective of the tumor suppressor TP53 or ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) status via induction of the mitochondrial pathway. Apoptosis was preceded by an increase in mRNA and protein levels of proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins of the BH3-only subgroup, including BIM, NOXA, and PUMA in CLL cells. Strikingly, B lymphocytes from Noxa(-/-) or Bim(-/-) mice were partially protected from the cytotoxic effects of AICAR. Consistently, B cells from Noxa(-/-)/Bim(-/-) mice resisted induction of apoptosis by AICAR as potently as B lymphocytes overexpressing transgenic BCL-2. These findings support the notion that AICAR is an interesting alternative therapeutic option for CLL patients with impaired p53 function and resistance to conventional chemotherapy.","['Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'de Frias, Merce', 'Campas, Clara', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Labi, Verena', 'Viollet, Benoit', 'Benito, Adalberto', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Villunger, Andreas', 'Gil, Joan']","['Santidrian AF', 'Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'Cosialls AM', 'de Frias M', 'Campas C', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Alonso E', 'Labi V', 'Viollet B', 'Benito A', 'Pons G', 'Villunger A', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100727,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31230-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-283960 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):3023-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-283960.

We determined the effects of chemotherapy (cytarabine) on the activation status of Mnk in AML cells and its role in the generation of antileukemic responses. A variety of experimental approaches were used, including immunoblotting, apoptosis assays, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of proteins, and clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor assays in methylcellulose. Cytarabine induced phosphorylation/activation of Mnk and Mnk-mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser209, as evidenced by studies involving pharmacological inhibition of Mnk or experiments using cells with targeted disruption of Mnk1 and Mnk2 genes. To assess the functional relevance of cytarabine-inducible engagement of Mnk/eIF4E pathway, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of Mnk on cytarabine-mediated suppression of primitive leukemic progenitors [leukemic colony forming unit (CFU-L)] were examined. Concomitant treatment of cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of Mnk or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mnk1/2 strongly enhanced the suppressive effects of low cytarabine concentrations on CFU-L. It is noteworthy that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin also induced phosphorylation of eIF4E in a Mnk-dependent manner, whereas inhibition strongly enhanced its antileukemic effects. These data demonstrate that Mnk kinases are activated in a negative-feedback regulatory manner in response to chemotherapy and impair the generation of antileukemic responses. They also identify this pathway as a novel target for the design of new approaches to enhance the antileukemic effects of chemotherapy or mTOR inhibitors in AML.","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Glaser, Heather', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Joshi, Sonali', 'Ueda, Takeshi', 'Watanabe-Fukunaga, Rie', 'Fukunaga, Rikiro', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Altman JK', 'Glaser H', 'Sassano A', 'Joshi S', 'Ueda T', 'Watanabe-Fukunaga R', 'Fukunaga R', 'Tallman MS', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the pathological and clinical findings of nine cases of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm presenting in patients under the age of 18 years who were reviewed at our institution. We also identified 20 well-documented additional pediatric cases in the literature. RESULTS: In the combined analysis, the overall survival rate among the 25 patients with available follow-up, all having received chemotherapy, was 72% (follow-up ranging from 9 months to 13 years, with a median of 30 months). The event-free survival rate was 64%. Nine patients were alive 5 years after the original diagnosis, although only three of them had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation--one in first complete remission and two in second remission. Of the seven patients who lacked cutaneous disease at presentation, 100% survived, including five who were alive more than 5 years after diagnosis, although only two had undergone stem cell transplantation. Among the 18 patients who presented with cutaneous disease and for whom follow-up data were available, only 11 survived (61%). Detailed immunophenotypic characterization and clinical features of all cases are presented. Unexpectedly, three of four cases of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm tested showed focal positivity for S-100. S-100 was negative in 28 cases of acute myeloid leukemia evaluated for this marker. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to adult cases, in which long-term survival depends on stem cell transplantation in first complete remission, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms in children are clinically less aggressive.

Overexpression or activating mutation of TrkA has been described in human acute myeloid leukemia cells. In the present study, we show the chaperone association of TrkA with heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and the inhibitory effect of the hsp90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, on TrkA levels and signaling in cultured and primary myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment with 17-DMAG disrupted the binding of TrkA with hsp90 and the cochaperone cdc37, resulting in polyubiquitylation, proteasomal degradation, and depletion of TrkA. Exposure to 17-DMAG inhibited NGF-induced p-TrkA, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 levels, as well as induced apoptosis of K562, 32D cells with ectopic expression of wild-type TrkA or the constitutively active mutant Delta TrkA, and of primary myeloid leukemia cells. Additionally, 17-DMAG treatment inhibited NGF-induced neurite formation in the rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells. Cotreatment with 17-DMAG and K-252a, an inhibitor of TrkA-mediated signaling, induced synergistic loss of viability of cultured and primary myeloid leukemia cells. These findings show that TrkA is an hsp90 client protein, and inhibition of hsp90 depletes TrkA and its progrowth and prosurvival signaling in myeloid leukemia cells. These findings also support further evaluation of the combined activity of an hsp90 inhibitor and TrkA antagonist against myeloid leukemia cells.","['Rao, Rekha', 'Nalluri, Srilatha', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Balusu, Ramesh', 'Joshi, Atul', 'Mudunuru, Uma', 'Buckley, Kathleen M', 'Robbins, Kelly', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Reuther, Gary W', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Rao R', 'Nalluri S', 'Fiskus W', 'Balusu R', 'Joshi A', 'Mudunuru U', 'Buckley KM', 'Robbins K', 'Ustun C', 'Reuther GW', 'Bhalla KN']","['Medical College of Georgia Cancer Center, 1120 15th Street CN 2133, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA116629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129962-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100727,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Nerve Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'PC12 Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polyubiquitin/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, trkA/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",PMC3008427,['NIHMS231526'],2010/07/29 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0336 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0336 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Aug;9(8):2232-42. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0336.

Our studies in indolent primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells showed that SNS-032 inhibited transcription, diminished the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, and induced apoptosis. The present study focuses on evaluating this compound in four proliferating mantle cell lymphoma lines (Jeko-1, Granta 519, Mino, and SP-53). Consistent with its action against Cdk9 and Cdk7, SNS-032 inhibited the phosphorylation of RNA pol II in all four lines and blocked RNA synthesis. The transcripts and protein levels of short-lived proteins decreased, including cyclin D1 and Mcl-1. Cell growth was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner in all lines. Apoptosis was induced in JeKo-1, Mino, and SP-53 cells without disrupting cell cycle distribution. However, apoptosis was limited in Granta cells; rather, there was a significant reduction of clonogenic survival. Small interfering RNA was used to specifically knock down Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 in JeKo-1 and Granta cells. Knocking down Mcl-1 induced significant apoptosis in Jeko-1 cells but not Granta cells. Reducing cyclin D1, rather than Mcl-1, was associated with loss of clonogenic survival in Granta cells. Thus, these results indicated that mantle cell lymphoma cell lines have distinct mechanisms sustaining their survival, and the mechanism of action of SNS-032 is dependent on the biological context of an individual line.","['Chen, Rong', 'Chubb, Sherri', 'Cheng, Tiewei', 'Hawtin, Rachael E', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William']","['Chen R', 'Chubb S', 'Cheng T', 'Hawtin RE', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Houston Health Science Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16772/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-010003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534-040005/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100727,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0', '(N-(5-(((5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-oxazolyl)methyl)thio)-2-thiazolyl)-4-piperidinec', 'arboxamide)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",PMC2929954,['NIHMS219784'],2010/07/29 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-3578 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3578 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 15;70(16):6587-97. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3578.

In CML patients, although myeloid cells are remarkably proliferating, erythroid cells are rather decreased and anemia is commonly observed. This phenotype is quite different from that observed in polycythemia vera (PV) caused by JAK2 V617F, whereas both oncogenic TKs activate common downstream molecules at the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To clarify this mechanism, we investigated the effects of BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F on erythropoiesis. Enforced expression of BCR-ABL but not of JAK2 V617F in murine LSK (Lineage(-)Sca-1(hi)CD117(hi)) cells inhibited the development of erythroid cells. Among several signaling molecules downstream of BCR-ABL, an active mutant of N-Ras (N-RasE12) but not of STAT5 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibited erythropoiesis, while N-RasE12 enhanced the development of myeloid cells. BCR-ABL activated Ras signal more intensely than JAK2 V617F, and inhibition of Ras by manumycin A, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, ameliorated erythroid colony formation of CML cells. As for the mechanisms of Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis, we found that GATA-1, an erythroid-specific transcription factor, blocked Ras-mediated mitogenic signaling at the level of MEK through the direct interaction. Furthermore, enforced expression of N-RasE12 in LSK cells derived from p53-, p16(INK4a)/p19(ARF)-, and p21(CIP1/WAF1)-null/wild-type mice revealed that suppressed erythroid cell growth by N-RasE12 was restored only by p21(CIP1/WAF1) deficiency, indicating that a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21(CIP1/WAF1), plays crucial roles in Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis. These data would, at least partly, explain why respective oncogenic TKs cause different disease phenotypes.","['Tokunaga, Masahiro', 'Ezoe, Sachiko', 'Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Satoh, Yusuke', 'Fukushima, Kentaro', 'Matsui, Keiko', 'Shibata, Masaru', 'Tanimura, Akira', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Tokunaga M', 'Ezoe S', 'Tanaka H', 'Satoh Y', 'Fukushima K', 'Matsui K', 'Shibata M', 'Tanimura A', 'Oritani K', 'Matsumura I', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100727,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'OIQ298X4XD (manumycin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Polyenes/pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC2951249,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)88908-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.118653 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Oct 8;285(41):31774-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.118653.

For some women, however, oocyte, embryo or ovarian tissue cryopreservation were not proposed at the time. For three such women, orthotopic allotransplantation of fresh ovarian tissue from their genetically non-identical sister was performed. METHODS: Three women, aged 20, 15 and 12 years, respectively, underwent chemotherapy and total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the donor in each case being their HLA-compatible sister. Years later, HLA group analysis revealed complete chimerism, and ovarian allografting was performed, with the ovarian tissue donor being the sister who had already donated bone marrow. No immunosuppressive therapy was administered. No sign of rejection was observed. RESULTS: Restoration of ovarian function occurred in all three cases, respectively, 6, 3.5 and 3.5 months after transplantation. The timing of the first estradiol peaks and the persistence of ovarian function were probably related to the primordial follicle density of donor ovarian tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy, ovarian allografting between genetically non-identical sisters allowed restoration of ovarian function in cases where previous BMT from the HLA-compatible sister resulted in full chimerism, avoiding the threat of rejection.","['Donnez, Jacques', 'Squifflet, Jean', 'Pirard, Celine', 'Jadoul, Pascale', 'Dolmans, Marie-Madeleine']","['Donnez J', 'Squifflet J', 'Pirard C', 'Jadoul P', 'Dolmans MM']","['Department of Gynecology, Cliniques Universitaires St Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Avenue Hippocrate, 10, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100727,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chimerism', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Estradiol/biosynthesis/blood', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/agonists', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Ovary/*physiology/*transplantation', 'Siblings', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'beta-Thalassemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy']",,,2010/07/29 06:00,2011/01/11 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['deq186 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/deq186 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2010 Oct;25(10):2489-95. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deq186.

A growing body of evidence suggests that deficiency of the transcription factor Fli1 (Friend leukemia integration-1) has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SSc. Fli1 is expressed in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells, and has important roles in the activation, differentiation, development, and survival of these cells. Previous studies demonstrated that Fli1 is downregulated in SSc fibroblasts by an epigenetic mechanism and a series of experiments with Fli1-deficient animal models revealed that Fli1 deficiency in fibroblasts and endothelial cells reproduces the histopathologic features of fibrosis and vasculopathy in SSc, respectively. In this article, we review the impact of Fli1 deficiency on the pathogenesis of SSc and discuss a new therapeutic strategy for SSc by targeting the transcription factor Fli1.","['Asano, Yoshihide', 'Bujor, Andreea M', 'Trojanowska, Maria']","['Asano Y', 'Bujor AM', 'Trojanowska M']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. yasano-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],['R01 AR042334/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100703,Netherlands,J Dermatol Sci,Journal of dermatological science,9011485,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Collagen Type I/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology/physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",PMC3826615,['NIHMS525829'],2010/07/29 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-1811(10)00200-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jdermsci.2010.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dermatol Sci. 2010 Sep;59(3):153-62. doi: 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2010.06.008.

PQQ induced apoptosis in human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells and this was accompanied by depletion of the major cellular antioxidant glutathione and increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with glutathione (GSH) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) did not spare PQQ toxicity but resulted in a 2-5-fold increase in PQQ-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Cellular GSH levels increased following treatment by NAC alone but were severely depleted by co-treatment with NAC and PQQ. This was accompanied by an increase in intracellular ROS. Alternatively, depletion of glutathione also resulted in increased PQQ cytotoxicity. However, the cells underwent necrosis as evidenced by dual labeling with annexin V and propidium iodide. PQQ-induced cytotoxicity is thus critically regulated by the cellular redox status. An increase in GSH can augment apoptosis and its depletion can switch the mode of cell death to necrosis in the presence of PQQ. Our data suggest that modulation of intracellular GSH can be used as an effective strategy to potentiate cytotoxicity of quinones like PQQ.","['Shankar, Bhavani S', 'Pandey, Ruchi', 'Amin, Prayag', 'Misra, Hari S', 'Sainis, Krishna B']","['Shankar BS', 'Pandey R', 'Amin P', 'Misra HS', 'Sainis KB']","['Radiation Biology and Health Sciences Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Redox Rep,Redox report : communications in free radical research,9511366,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '72909-34-3 (PQQ Cofactor)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'PQQ Cofactor/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",PMC7067314,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/174329210X12650506623762 [doi]'],ppublish,Redox Rep. 2010;15(4):146-54. doi: 10.1179/174329210X12650506623762.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we suggest a new molecular mechanism that TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) down-regulates P-glycoprotein (P-gp) through inhibition of DNA-PKcs/Akt/GSK-3beta pathway and activation of caspases and thereby sensitize MDR cells to MDR-related drugs. RESULTS: MDR variants, CEM/VLB10-2, CEM/VLB55-8 and CEM/VLB100 cells, with gradually increased levels of P-gp derived from human lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells, were gradually more susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity than parental CEM cells. The P-gp level of MDR variants was positively correlated with the levels of DNA-PKcs, pAkt, pGSK-3beta and c-Myc as well as DR5 and negatively correlated with the level of c-FLIPs. Hypersensitivity of CEM/VLB100 cells to TRAIL was accompanied by the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as well as the activation of initiator caspases. In addition, TRAIL-induced down-regulation of DNA-PKcs/Akt/GSK-3beta pathway and c-FLIP and up-regulation of cell surface expression of death receptors were associated with the increased susceptibility to TRAIL of MDR cells. Moreover, TRAIL inhibited P-gp efflux function via caspase-3-dependent degradation of P-gp as well as DNA-PKcs and subsequently sensitized MDR cells to MDR-related drugs such as vinblastine and doxorubicin. We also found that suppression of DNA-PKcs by siRNA enhanced the susceptibility of MDR cells to vincristine as well as TRAIL via down-regulation of c-FLIP and P-gp expression and up-regulation of DR5. CONCLUSION: This study showed for the first time that the MDR variant of CEM cells was hypersensitive to TRAIL due to up-regulation of DR5 and concomitant down-regulation of c-FLIP, and degradation of P-gp and DNA-PKcs by activation of caspase-3 might be important determinants of TRAIL-induced sensitization of MDR cells to MDR-related drugs. Therefore, combination of TRAIL and chemotherapeutic drugs may be a good strategy for treatment of cancer with multidrug resistance.","['Seo, Suk-Bin', 'Hur, Jung-Gu', 'Kim, Mi-Ju', 'Lee, Jae-Won', 'Kim, Hak-Bong', 'Bae, Jae-Ho', 'Kim, Dong-Wan', 'Kang, Chi-Dug', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Seo SB', 'Hur JG', 'Kim MJ', 'Lee JW', 'Kim HB', 'Bae JH', 'Kim DW', 'Kang CD', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100728,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology']",PMC2918570,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-199 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-199 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jul 28;9:199. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-199.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether HDAC inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined the acetylation of histone H4 by immunohistochemistry in newly diagnosed ALL patients and evaluated the impact of acetylation on complete remission (CR) rate, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Patients > or = 18 years of age and an available diagnostic bone marrow biopsy were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify univariate and multivariate correlates of CR, RFS, and OS. The variables histone H4 acetylation (positive or negative), white blood count, cytogenetic (CG) risk group (CALGB criteria), and age were used in multivariate analysis. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, histone acetylation was associated with a trend towards an improved OS (for all CG risk groups) (HR = 0.51, p = 0.09). In patients without poor risk CG, there was an impressive association between the presence of histone acetylation and an improved CR rate (OR 3.43, p = 0.035), RFS (HR 0.07, p = 0.005), and OS (HR 0.24, p = 0.007). This association remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis.

In addition to the BCR-ABL target oncoprotein, they also inhibit off-target kinases (e.g. c-KIT, TEC, SRC), some of which have physiological functions in immune responses. In vitro studies have implied immunosuppressive effects of TKI treatment. As comprehensive in vivo data are missing, we aimed at analyzing the detailed immunoprofile of patients with CML at diagnosis and during therapy. We collected 88 peripheral blood (PB) and 73 bone marrow (BM) samples from 54 patients with CML at diagnosis, during imatinib and dasatinib therapies. Leukocytes and lymphocyte subclasses were analyzed with an extensive flow cytometry panel including markers for activation, differentiation and memory status. At diagnosis, a lower proportion of B cells and dendritic cells and an increased amount of NKT-like cells were detected in the BM. During imatinib therapy, all these changes normalized and the immunoprofile resembled healthy controls. However, dasatinib patients were clearly divided into two distinct groups: one similar to healthy controls and the other showing immunoactivation characterized by significant elevations of CD8+, NK- and NKT-like cells in PB. T cells of the latter group strongly expressed CD57+, HLA-DR and CD45RO and had low CD62L antigen levels characteristic of late memory cytotoxic lymphocytes. Our results indicate that while both TKIs show immunosuppressive effects in vitro, they have a significant and differential effect on the numbers and proportions of immune effector cells in vivo. In particular, in a distinct subgroup of dasatinib-treated patients, immune reactivity is markedly enhanced warranting careful follow-up.","['Rohon, Peter', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Rohon P', 'Porkka K', 'Mustjoki S']","['Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immune System/immunology/pathology', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/29 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1501 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01501.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Nov;85(5):387-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01501.x.,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have showed that contrasting normal stem cells, AML stem cells express CD96 and CD123, but lack of CD90, although both of them reside within the CD34(+)CD38(-) population. So far, little is known about expression of the markers on MDS HSC. In this study, we analyzed the immunophenotypic characteristics of CD34(+)CD38(-) bone marrow (BM) cells by multicolor flow cytometry in 38 patients with MDS and 10 control patients. We found that CD34(+)CD38(-) BM cells coexpressed CD13, CD33, CD117, CD133, and HLA-DR almost in all patients, but in MDS they expressed higher amounts of CD13 (79% +/- 16% vs. 36% +/- 13%, P < 0.05) and CD133 (66% +/- 20% vs. 25% +/- 13%, P < 0.05). CD90 was expressed in all control patients but just in 63% of patients with MDS. No control patients had an expression of CD2, CD5, CD7, CD44, CD96, and CD123, which expressed variable amounts in 17-53% of patients with MDS. The level of CD13 in RCMD (89% +/- 7%), RAEB-1 (88% +/- 11%), and RAEB-2 (81% +/- 13%) were obviously higher than that of RA (63% +/- 16%, P < 0.05). CD2, CD5, and CD7 were more frequently observed in RAEB or INT and HIGH-R cases. Taken together, we demonstrate MDS stem cells display deranged phenotypic abnormalities that may make them particularly difficult to eradicate using therapies targeted against surface antigens, and the percentage of cells expressing CD13 is notably higher in patients with high-grade MDS that may be a potential prognostic indicator of MDS in the future.","['Xie, Wei', 'Wang, Xuhua', 'Du, Wen', 'Liu, Wei', 'Qin, Xiaoming', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Xie W', 'Wang X', 'Du W', 'Liu W', 'Qin X', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Here we demonstrate that combinations of the dietary plant polyphenols--curcumin and carnosic acid--at noncytotoxic concentrations of each agent, produced a synergistic antiproliferative effect and a massive apoptotic cell death in HL-60 and KG-1a human AML cells. In contrast, combinations of curcumin and another plant polyphenol silibinin had a predominantly additive cytostatic effect, without pronounced cytotoxicity. Neither polyphenol combination affected viability of normal human fibroblasts or proliferating and nonproliferating blood cells. Early stage of curcumin/carnosic acid-induced apoptosis was associated with cleavage (activation) of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and the proapoptotic protein Bid, but not with oxidative stress or altered levels of other Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, Bax, and Bak). Inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-9 markedly attenuated apoptosis, indicating the involvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Caspase-8 inhibition abrogated Bid cleavage and strongly reduced caspase-9 activation, suggesting that the cross-talk mechanism mediated by caspase-8-dependent Bid cleavage can contribute to the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by curcumin + carnosic acid. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanistic basis for the potential use of dietary plant polyphenol combinations in the treatment and prevention of AML.","['Pesakhov, Stella', 'Khanin, Marina', 'Studzinski, George P', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Pesakhov S', 'Khanin M', 'Studzinski GP', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA117942-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",PMC2911976,['NIHMS170299'],2010/07/28 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['924626370 [pii]', '10.1080/01635581003693082 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2010;62(6):811-24. doi: 10.1080/01635581003693082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This occurs normally during fetal development but is abnormal postpartum. The most common sites of EMH are the spleen and liver. The phenomenon occurs in a number of disease states, notably in myelofibrosis, thalassemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, sickle cell anemia, polycythemia vera, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Affected patients often develop symptoms related to the location of the EMH. Reported treatments include red blood cell transfusions, surgical excision, decompressive laminectomy in cases of cord compression, chemotherapy, and irradiation. Radiation therapy is highly effective for treating hematopoietic tissue because such tissues are extremely radiosensitive. Megavoltage helical tomotherapy is a technical advance in the delivery of radiation therapy, allowing more conformal and precise treatments. The present case report describes a patient with the diagnosis of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis who subsequently developed EMH of the pericardium with effusion and tamponade. By utilizing tomotherapy we were able to treat the pericardium while sparing much of the myocardium. The patient tolerated treatment well without acute adverse effects.

As a result, when the shRNA plasmid was stably introduced into the cell line, the mRNA and protein of BMI-1 were specifically down-regulated, and the cells increased in the phase of G1 and cells in S phase significantly decreased by flow cytometric analysis; the knockdown of BMI-1 expression could lead to significant up-regulation of p16INK4a, HOXA9 and HOXC13 mRNA expression, but hTERT and HOXB4 mRNA expression did not change significantly.

Although normally associated with cell migration, the chemokine, CXCL12, is one of the factors known to support the survival of CLL cells. Thus, the signaling pathways activated by CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, were investigated as components of these pathways and may represent targets that if inhibited, could render resistant CLL cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the downstream signaling targets that contribute to the survival effects of CXCL12 in CLL, we took a phosphoproteomics approach to identify and compare phosphopeptides in unstimulated and CXCL12-stimulated primary CLL cells. While some of the survival pathways activated by CXCL12 in CLL are known, including Akt and ERK1/2, this approach enabled the identification of additional signaling targets and novel phosphoproteins that could have implications in CLL disease and therapy. In addition to the phosphoproteomics results, we provide evidence from western blot validation that the tumor suppressor, programmed cell death factor 4 (PDCD4), is a previously unidentified phosphorylation target of CXCL12 signaling in all CLL cells probed. Additionally, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which mediates anti-apoptotic signaling and has previously been linked to chemotherapeutic resistance, was detected in a subset (approximately 25%) of CLL patients cells examined. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Since PDCD4 and HSP27 have previously been associated with cancer and regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, these proteins may have novel implications in CLL cell survival and represent potential therapeutic targets. PDCD4 also represents a previously unknown signaling target of chemokine receptors; therefore, these observations increase our understanding of alternative pathways to migration that may be activated or inhibited by chemokines in the context of cancer cell survival.","[""O'Hayre, Morgan"", 'Salanga, Catherina L', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Messmer, Davorka', 'Dorrestein, Pieter C', 'Handel, Tracy M']","[""O'Hayre M"", 'Salanga CL', 'Kipps TJ', 'Messmer D', 'Dorrestein PC', 'Handel TM']","['Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI037113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI37113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100722,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",PMC2908618,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0011716 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jul 22;5(7):e11716. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011716.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this paper is to summarize the new proposals from ECIL 3, based on the results of studies published after the ECIL 2 meeting: (1) the prophylactic recommendations for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were formulated differently, by splitting the neutropenic and the GVHD phases and taking into account recent data on voriconazole; (2) micafungin was introduced as an alternative drug for empirical antifungal therapy; (3) although several studies were published on preemptive antifungal approaches in neutropenic patients, the group decided not to propose any recommendation, as the only randomized study comparing an empirical versus a preemptive approach showed a significant excess of fungal disease in the preemptive group.","['Maertens, J', 'Marchetti, O', 'Herbrecht, R', 'Cornely, O A', 'Fluckiger, U', 'Frere, P', 'Gachot, B', 'Heinz, W J', 'Lass-Florl, C', 'Ribaud, P', 'Thiebaut, A', 'Cordonnier, C']","['Maertens J', 'Marchetti O', 'Herbrecht R', 'Cornely OA', 'Fluckiger U', 'Frere P', 'Gachot B', 'Heinz WJ', 'Lass-Florl C', 'Ribaud P', 'Thiebaut A', 'Cordonnier C']","['Department of Hematology, Leukemia and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University Hospitals Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['090532/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",20100726,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy', 'Caspofungin', 'Echinocandins/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lipopeptides/therapeutic use', 'Micafungin', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/prevention & control', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2010175 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2010.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 May;46(5):709-18. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2010.175.

The abnormal granules are readily seen in blood and marrow granulocytes. About 50% to 85% of patients eventually enter an accelerated phase, manifested by fever, lymphadenopathy, anemia, jaundice, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and widespread lymphohistiocytic organ infiltrates. The first accelerated phase of CHS may occur shortly after birth or several years later. Most patients undergo a variable period of recurrent infections before going into the accelerated phase. Therefore, primary presentation in the accelerated phase is unusual. This case was referred to our institution that is a tertiary care cancer centre, with a clinical diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia. Hence this interesting case of CHS in accelerated phase at presentation is described. The child had 1-month history of fever, bilateral neck swellings, and loss of appetite. On the basis of the clinical presentation, hematologic, and histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of accelerated phase of CHS was made. The child was treated with antipyretics, antibiotics, and stem cell transplantation was suggested to him. When the child presents to a hospital with oculocutaneous albinism and recurrent infections, careful examination of the peripheral blood smear by an experienced morphologist cannot be overemphasized. A high degree of awareness and early recognition of the syndrome, could lead to the institution of the only possible curative treatment, bone marrow transplant, before the accelerated phase supervenes.","['Nargund, Ashwini R', 'Madhumathi, Davanam S', 'Premalatha, Chennagiri S', 'Rao, Clementina Rama', 'Appaji, Lingappa', 'Lakshmidevi, Vishweshvaraih']","['Nargund AR', 'Madhumathi DS', 'Premalatha CS', 'Rao CR', 'Appaji L', 'Lakshmidevi V']","['Department of Hematopathology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. dr_ashwini@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Chediak-Higashi Syndrome/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e62663 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Aug;32(6):e223-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e62663.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PAX-5, a transcription factor expressed throughout B-cell maturation, is detected in most B-cell neoplasms including those that lack expression of mature B-cell markers, such as classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), B-lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell lymphomas following rituximab therapy. The lack of PAX-5 expression in most CD30-positive non-hematopoietic malignancies (embryonal carcinoma and seminoma) and T-cell lymphomas, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), suggests that the absence of PAX-5 may be used to confirm non-B-cell lineage. The goal of this study was to retrospectively assess PAX-5 immunoreactivity in diagnostic samples of hematolymphoid and other non-hematopoietic malignancies. DESIGN: Diagnostic lymph node, decalcified core bone marrow biopsies and tissue sections from 111 archived paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and a tissue lymphoma microarray were immunostained using a monoclonal antibody to PAX-5. The corresponding hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections and additional immunostains were simultaneously evaluated. PAX-5 immunoreactivity in neoplastic cells was scored as positive or negative. This study was exempted by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research. RESULTS: Nuclear PAX-5 immunoreactivity was detected in 88% (36/41) of Hodgkin lymphoma, all cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=72), small B-cell lymphomas (n=5), B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and mixed phenotype acute leukemia with B-cell lineage (n=5). PAX-5 was not detected in ALCL (n=22), T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, mixed phenotype acute leukemia with T-cell lineage (n=5), acute myeloid leukemia (n=4), carcinoid tumors with typical morphology (n=5), melanoma (n=3), and undifferentiated/metastatic tumors (n=8). Non-neoplastic bone marrow sections showed scattered nuclear staining in small B-cell lymphocytes/hematogones. The detection of PAX-5 immunoreactivity resulted in the reclassification of two cases of ALCL to cHL. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results demonstrate that including PAX-5 in a panel with other immunomarkers helps establish B-cell lineage and increases diagnostic yield.","['Desouki, Mohamed M', 'Post, Ginell R', 'Cherry, Daniel', 'Lazarchick, John']","['Desouki MM', 'Post GR', 'Cherry D', 'Lazarchick J']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA. lazarj@musc.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Med Res,Clinical medicine & research,101175887,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/diagnosis', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*analysis']",PMC2910102,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/11/09 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['8/2/84 [pii]', '10.3121/cmr.2010.891 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Med Res. 2010 Jul;8(2):84-8. doi: 10.3121/cmr.2010.891.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk assignment and clinical and genetic characterization of AML with chromosome 3q abnormalities other than inv(3)/t(3;3) remain largely unresolved. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetics, molecular genetics, therapy response, and outcome analysis were performed in 6,515 newly diagnosed adult AML patients. Patients were treated on Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group/Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (HOVON/SAKK; n = 3,501) and German-Austrian Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group (AMLSG; n = 3,014) protocols. EVI1 and MDS1/EVI1 expression was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: 3q abnormalities were detected in 4.4% of AML patients (288 of 6,515). Four distinct groups were defined: A: inv(3)/t(3;3), 32%; B: balanced t(3q26), 18%; C: balanced t(3q21), 7%; and D: other 3q abnormalities, 43%. Monosomy 7 was the most common additional aberration in groups (A), 66%; (B), 31%; and (D), 37%. N-RAS mutations and dissociate EVI1 versus MDS1/EVI1 overexpression were associated with inv(3)/t(3;3). Patients with inv(3)/t(3;3) and balanced t(3q21) at diagnosis presented with higher WBC and platelet counts. In multivariable analysis, only inv(3)/t(3;3), but not t(3q26) and t(3q21), predicted reduced relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99; P < .001) and overall survival (HR, 1.4; P = .006). This adverse prognostic impact of inv(3)/t(3;3) was enhanced by additional monosomy 7. Group D 3q aberrant AML also had a poor outcome related to the coexistence of complex and/or monosomal karyotypes and cryptic inv(3)/t(3;3). CONCLUSION: Various categories of 3q abnormalities in AML can be distinguished according to their clinical, hematologic, and genetic features. AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) represents a distinctive subgroup with unfavorable prognosis.","['Lugthart, Sanne', 'Groschel, Stefan', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'van Zelderen-Bhola, Shama Lydia', 'Jan Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'van den Berg-de Ruiter, Eva', 'Schanz, Urs', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Kohne, Claus-Henning', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Horst, Heinz A', 'Koller, Elisabeth', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Bentz, Martin', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Theobald, Matthias', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Lugthart S', 'Groschel S', 'Beverloo HB', 'Kayser S', 'Valk PJ', 'van Zelderen-Bhola SL', 'Jan Ossenkoppele G', 'Vellenga E', 'van den Berg-de Ruiter E', 'Schanz U', 'Verhoef G', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Ferrant A', 'Kohne CH', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Horst HA', 'Koller E', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Bentz M', 'Ganser A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Jotterand M', 'Krauter J', 'Pabst T', 'Theobald M', 'Schlenk RF', 'Delwel R', 'Dohner K', 'Lowenberg B', 'Dohner H']","['Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100726,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EVL protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Odds Ratio', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.29.2771 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.29.2771 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 20;28(24):3890-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.29.2771.

Other modifications (irrespective of CD20 expression) included early anthracycline intensification, alterations in number of risk-adapted intrathecal chemotherapy treatments for CNS prophylaxis, additional early and late intensifications, and extension of maintenance phase chemotherapy by 6 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-two adolescents and adults with de novo Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative precursor B-lineage ALL were treated with standard or modified hyper-CVAD regimens. The latter incorporated standard-dose rituximab if CD20 expression > or = 20%. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate was 95% with 3-year rates of CR duration (CRD) and survival (OS) of 60% and 50%, respectively. In the younger (age < 60 years) CD20-positive subset, rates of CRD and OS were superior with the modified hyper-CVAD and rituximab regimens compared with standard hyper-CVAD (70% v 38%; P < .001% and 75% v 47%, P = .003). In contrast, rates of CRD and OS for CD20-negative counterparts treated with modified versus standard hyper-CVAD regimens were similar (72% v 68%, P = not significant [NS] and 64% v 65%, P = NS, respectively). Older patients with CD20-positive ALL did not benefit from rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (rates of CRD 45% v 50%, P = NS and OS 28% v 32%, P = NS, respectively), related in part to deaths in CR. CONCLUSION: The incorporation of rituximab into the hyper-CVAD regimen appears to improve outcome for younger patients with CD20-positive Ph-negative precursor B-lineage ALL.","['Thomas, Deborah A', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Thomas DA', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda W', 'Ravandi F', 'Verstovsek S', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Andreeff M', 'Pierce S', 'Garris R', 'Keating MJ', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian HM']","['University of Texas M.

Survival of CLL cells depends on microenvironmental factors. Even though long-lived in vivo, CLL cells rapidly die by spontaneous apoptosis in vitro unless cocultured with stromal cells or their conditioned medium. In the present study, we show that survival of CLL cells is maintained in high cell density cultures, where the main prosurvival activity is delivered by monocytes. Cytokine array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies revealed increased expression of soluble CD14 by monocytes in the presence of CLL cells. The addition of recombinant soluble CD14 to primary CLL cells resulted in significantly increased cell survival rates, which were associated with higher activity nuclear factor kappaB. Quantification of serum levels of soluble CD14 revealed abnormally high levels of this protein in CLL patients, indicating a potential role of soluble CD14 in vivo. In summary, the presented data show that monocytes help in the survival of CLL cells by secreting soluble CD14, which induces nuclear factor kappaB activation in these cells, and that CLL cells actively shape their microenvironment by inducing CD14 secretion in accessory monocytes.","['Seiffert, Martina', 'Schulz, Angela', 'Ohl, Sibylle', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Lichter, Peter']","['Seiffert M', 'Schulz A', 'Ohl S', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P']","['German Cancer Research Center, Department for Molecular Genetics, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100726,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*blood/genetics', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Solubility']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31062-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-284505 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 18;116(20):4223-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-284505.

Hemangioblasts, which have a differentiation potential for both endothelial and hematopoietic lineages, arise in the primitive streak and migrate into the yolk sac to form blood islands, where primitive hematopoiesis occurs. ZFAT (a zinc-finger gene in autoimmune thyroid disease susceptibility region/an immune-related transcriptional regulator containing 18 C(2)H(2)-type zinc-finger domains and one AT-hook) was originally identified as an immune-related transcriptional regulator containing 18 C(2)H(2)-type zinc-finger domains and one AT-hook, and is highly conserved among species. ZFAT is thought to be a critical transcription factor involved in immune-regulation and apoptosis; however, developmental roles for ZFAT remain unknown. Here we show that Zfat-deficient (Zfat(-/-)) mice are embryonic-lethal, with impaired differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in blood islands, where ZFAT is exactly expressed. Expression levels of Tal1, Lmo2, and Gata1 in Zfat(-/-) yolk sacs are much reduced compared with those of wild-type mice, and ChIP-PCR analysis revealed that ZFAT binds promoter regions for these genes in vivo. Furthermore, profound reduction in TAL1, LMO2, and GATA1 protein expressions are observed in Zfat(-/-) blood islands. Taken together, these results suggest that ZFAT is indispensable for mouse embryonic development and functions as a critical transcription factor for primitive hematopoiesis through direct-regulation of Tal1, Lmo2, and Gata1. Elucidation of ZFAT functions in hematopoiesis might lead to a better understanding of transcriptional networks in differentiation and cellular programs of hematopoietic lineage and provide useful information for applied medicine in stem cell therapy.","['Tsunoda, Toshiyuki', 'Takashima, Yasuo', 'Tanaka, Yoko', 'Fujimoto, Takahiro', 'Doi, Keiko', 'Hirose, Yumiko', 'Koyanagi, Midori', 'Yoshida, Yasuhiro', 'Okamura, Tadashi', 'Kuroki, Masahide', 'Sasazuki, Takehiko', 'Shirasawa, Senji']","['Tsunoda T', 'Takashima Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fujimoto T', 'Doi K', 'Hirose Y', 'Koyanagi M', 'Yoshida Y', 'Okamura T', 'Kuroki M', 'Sasazuki T', 'Shirasawa S']","['Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, and Center for Advanced Molecular Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100726,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZFAT protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Yolk Sac/blood supply', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",PMC2922575,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1002494107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1002494107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Aug 10;107(32):14199-204. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1002494107.

Overexpression of the most advantageous miRNA, miR-125b, caused a dose-dependent myeloproliferative disorder that progressed to a lethal myeloid leukemia in mice and also enhanced hematopoietic engraftment in human immune system mice.

Many potent PBDs contain a C2-endo-exo unsaturated motif associated with the pyrrolo C-ring. The novel compound SG2202 is a PBD dimer containing this motif. SG2285 is a water-soluble prodrug of SG2202 in which two bisulfite groups inactivate the PBD N10-C11 imines. Once the bisulfites are eliminated, the imine moieties can bind covalently in the DNA minor groove, forming an interstrand cross-link. The mean in vitro cytotoxic potency of SG2285 against human tumor cell lines is GI(50) 20 pmol/L. SG2285 is highly efficient at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in cells, but they form more slowly than those produced by SG2202. Cellular sensitivity to SG2285 was primarily dependent on ERCC1 and homologous recombination repair. In primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, the mean LD(50) was significantly lower than in normal age-matched B and T lymphocytes. Antitumor activity was shown in several human tumor xenograft models, including ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma, with cures obtained in the latter model with a single dose. Further, in an advanced-stage colon model, SG2285 administered either as a single dose, or in two repeat dose schedules, was superior to irinotecan. Our findings define SG2285 as a highly active cytotoxic compound with antitumor properties desirable for further development.","['Hartley, John A', 'Hamaguchi, Anzu', 'Coffils, Marissa', 'Martin, Christopher R H', 'Suggitt, Marie', 'Chen, Zhizhi', 'Gregson, Stephen J', 'Masterson, Luke A', 'Tiberghien, Arnaud C', 'Hartley, Janet M', 'Pepper, Christopher', 'Lin, Thet Thet', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'Thurston, David E', 'Howard, Philip W']","['Hartley JA', 'Hamaguchi A', 'Coffils M', 'Martin CR', 'Suggitt M', 'Chen Z', 'Gregson SJ', 'Masterson LA', 'Tiberghien AC', 'Hartley JM', 'Pepper C', 'Lin TT', 'Fegan C', 'Thurston DE', 'Howard PW']","['Spirogen Ltd., UCL Cancer Institute, UK. john.hartley@ucl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['9994/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A9994/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C2259/A9994/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100726,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (SG 2285)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Benzodiazepinones/pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3533126,['EMS31575'],2010/07/28 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-0790 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0790 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 1;70(17):6849-58. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0790.

We reviewed long-term outcomes after gene therapy in nine patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), which is characterized by the absence of the cytokine receptor common gamma chain. METHODS: The nine patients, who lacked an HLA-identical donor, underwent ex vivo retrovirus-mediated transfer of gamma chain to autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells between 1999 and 2002. We assessed clinical events and immune function on long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Eight patients were alive after a median follow-up period of 9 years (range, 8 to 11). Gene therapy was initially successful at correcting immune dysfunction in eight of the nine patients. However, acute leukemia developed in four patients, and one died. Transduced T cells were detected for up to 10.7 years after gene therapy. Seven patients, including the three survivors of leukemia, had sustained immune reconstitution; three patients required immunoglobulin-replacement therapy. Sustained thymopoiesis was established by the persistent presence of naive T cells, even after chemotherapy in three patients. The T-cell-receptor repertoire was diverse in all patients. Transduced B cells were not detected. Correction of the immunodeficiency improved the patients' health. CONCLUSIONS: After nearly 10 years of follow-up, gene therapy was shown to have corrected the immunodeficiency associated with SCID-X1. Gene therapy may be an option for patients who do not have an HLA-identical donor for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and for whom the risks are deemed acceptable. This treatment is associated with a risk of acute leukemia.

Replication stress creates genomic instability in mammals. Using a well-defined multistep leukemia model driven by Spi-1/PU.1 overexpression in the mouse and Spi-1/PU.1-overexpressing human leukemic cells, we investigated the relationship between DNA replication and cancer progression. Here, using DNA molecular combing and flow cytometry methods, we show that Spi-1 increases the speed of replication by acting specifically on elongation rather than enhancing origin firing. This shortens the S-phase duration. Combining data from Spi-1 knockdown in murine cells with Spi-1 overexpression in human cells, we provide evidence that inappropriate Spi-1 expression is directly responsible for the replication alteration observed. Importantly, the acceleration of replication progression coincides with an increase in the frequency of genomic mutations without inducing DNA breakage.

Here, we show that CK2 is overexpressed and hyperactivated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Inhibition of CK2 induces apoptosis of CLL cells without significantly affecting normal B and T lymphocytes. Importantly, this effect is not reversed by coculture with OP9 stromal cells, which are otherwise capable of rescuing CLL cells from in vitro spontaneous apoptosis. CLL cell death upon CK2 inhibition is mediated by inactivation of PKC, a PI3K downstream target, and correlates with increased PTEN activity, indicating that CK2 promotes CLL cell survival at least in part via PI3K-dependent signaling. Although CK2 antagonists induce significant apoptosis of CLL cells in all patient samples analyzed, sensitivity to CK2 blockade positively correlates with the percentage of CLL cells in the peripheral blood, beta2 microglobulin serum levels and clinical stage. These data suggest that subsets of patients with aggressive and advanced stage disease may especially benefit from therapeutic strategies targeting CK2 function. Overall, our study indicates that CK2 plays a critical role in CLL cell survival, laying the groundwork for the inclusion of CK2 inhibitors into future therapeutic strategies.","['Martins, Leila R', 'Lucio, Paulo', 'Silva, Milene C', 'Anderes, Kenna L', 'Gameiro, Paula', 'Silva, Maria G', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Martins LR', 'Lucio P', 'Silva MC', 'Anderes KL', 'Gameiro P', 'Silva MG', 'Barata JT']","['Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Lisbon University Medical School, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100721,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31258-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-277947 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 14;116(15):2724-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-277947.

We found that LycoC, but not Lyco, was able to trigger apoptosis in HL60 cells, as documented by subdiploid DNA content and phosphatidylserine exposure. LycoC-induced apoptosis was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, suggesting that LycoC triggered apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. We also verified the redox state of cells by measuring glutathione (GSH) content, but only a small percentage of cells showed GSH depletion, suggesting that the loss of GSH may be a secondary consequence of ROS generation. Moreover, LycoC pretreatment effectively increased apoptosis induced by photodynamic therapy (PDT), a mode of cancer treatment using a photosensitizer and visible light. LycoC pretreatment was even more potent in improving PDT than pretreatment with ascorbic acid or alpha-tocopherol (or the two combined). Our results demonstrate that LycoC has a stronger cytotoxic effect than Lyco and is a better source of agents able to trigger apoptosis in HL60 cells and improve the efficacy of PDT in vitro.","['Ettorre, Anna', 'Frosali, Simona', 'Andreassi, Marco', 'Di Stefano, Anna']","['Ettorre A', 'Frosali S', 'Andreassi M', 'Di Stefano A']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Hammersmith Campus, Imperial College, London W12 0NN, UK. a.ettorre@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100721,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'SB0N2N0WV6 (Lycopene)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carotenoids', 'Glutathione/metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lycopene', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism/pharmacology', 'alpha-Tocopherol/metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ebm.2010.009386 [pii]', '10.1258/ebm.2010.009386 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2010 Sep;235(9):1114-25. doi: 10.1258/ebm.2010.009386.

At the inner level, the set of multipurpose global features was computed on each spectral plane by the same feature bank. All computed features were fused into a single feature vector.

Keratinocytes isolated from biopsy sites of GVHD but not from normal tissue showed even greater numbers of tetraploid cells (mean = 78%, range: 15%-85%; N = 9) after culture. To mimic the inflammatory process in GVHD, allogeneic HLA-mismatched lymphocytes were mixed with normal keratinocytes.

We were able to detect pre-existing mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 in four patients, particularly in patients with high BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. Most mutations disappeared with dasatinib, however, in five patients a clone with T315I appeared during dasatinib treatment. We conclude that sensitive molecular monitoring with real-time PCR for BCR-ABL1 transcripts and mutation screening of the ABL1 kinase domain of patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias are valuable for patient management, however, mutation findings should be interpreted with caution, as mutant clones not always behave in vivo as predicted by in vitro assays.","['Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Hermansson, Monica', 'Lundan, Tuija', 'Ohm, Anne-Charlotte', 'Engdahl, Ida', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Barbany, Gisela']","['Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Hermansson M', 'Lundan T', 'Ohm AC', 'Engdahl I', 'Hoglund M', 'Simonsson B', 'Porkka K', 'Barbany G']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. ulla.olsson.stromberg@akademiska.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Clone Cells/pathology', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/28 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/28 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1506 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01506.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Nov;85(5):399-404. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01506.x.,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 75% of patients achieve complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) after treatment with imatinib, which provides an opportunity to collect minimally involved hematopoietic progenitor stem cell (HPC) products. In order to assess the feasibility of HPC collection in patients with CML, we prospectively enrolled 24 patients who achieved CCR on therapy with imatinib. Two patients could not undergo HPC collection because of coagulopathy. A CD34+ cell yield of > or =2.0 x 10(6)/kg body weight was obtained in 16/22 (73%) patients. Patients who stopped imatinib for at least 3 weeks prior to HPC collection had significantly higher CD34+ cell yields (median: 6.52 x 10(6)/kg body weight) when compared with patients who continued imatinib through the collection (median: 3.74 x 10(6)/kg body weight). Mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) did not increase the levels of BCR-ABL transcript. With a mean follow-up of 46 months, all patients but one were in CCR. In conclusion, a significant number of CD34+ cells can be safely collected in patients with CML who are on imatinib therapy, but CD34+ cell yields improve when imatinib is temporarily withheld.","['Bashir, Qaiser', 'De Lima, Marcos J', 'McMannis, John D', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge E', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Jones, Dan', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar', 'Wei, Wei', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Hosing, Chitra']","['Bashir Q', 'De Lima MJ', 'McMannis JD', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Shpall E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes JE', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Jones D', 'Qazilbash M', 'Wei W', 'Giralt SA', 'Champlin RE', 'Hosing C']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.

METHODS: The study included 29 untreated B-CLL patients in stage A, and 21 in stages B and C, classified according to the Binet system; 31 healthy volunteers formed the control group. After centrifugation of heparinized peripheral blood, plasma levels of all investigated parameters were determined using spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: Plasma CAT activity was increased in B-CLL patients compared with control subjects; also, progression of disease was related with significantly higher plasma activity of CAT. Also, B-CLL patients showed significantly higher plasma concentration of MDA compared with controls. No statistically significant differences of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide as well as plasma activity of SOD and GPx between the tested groups were noted. CONCLUSION: Increase of CAT activity in B-CLL patients indicates that there is stimulation of the antioxidant enzyme system, while the increase of MDA concentration shows increased lipid peroxidation level. According to these results it could be concluded that an imbalance exists between oxidants and antioxidants in the plasma of B-CLL patients.","['Zelen, I', 'Djurdjevic, P', 'Popovic, S', 'Stojanovic, M', 'Jakovljevic, V', 'Radivojevic, S', 'Baskic, D', 'Arsenijevic, N']","['Zelen I', 'Djurdjevic P', 'Popovic S', 'Stojanovic M', 'Jakovljevic V', 'Radivojevic S', 'Baskic D', 'Arsenijevic N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kragujevac, S.

While hepatitis is a well-known complication during the treatment phase of ALL, the association of abnormal liver biochemistries at initial presentation of leukemia is poorly described. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence and assess the clinical impact of hepatitis at diagnosis in children with ALL. PROCEDURE: All children diagnosed with ALL at BC Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006 were included. Charts were reviewed and data recorded to a computerized spreadsheet. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven ALL patients were identified. Over one third of patients had abnormal liver transaminase values (AST and/or ALT). Of the patients with abnormal transaminases, (52%) had ALT elevations twice the upper limit of normal. Risk factors for elevated transaminases included a high WBC count at diagnosis, older age, bulky disease, and T-cell leukemia. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 3.4% of subjects. Of these cases, 60% received steroids prior to induction chemotherapy and all had rapid resolution of their hyperbilirubinemia to normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated transaminases are common at initial presentation of ALL and are likely due to hepatic injury from leukemic infiltrates. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia at presentation may require treatment modification and dose reduction. A short course of steroids prior to initiation of induction chemotherapy appears to result in rapid resolution of the hyperbilirubinemia with subsequent ability to provide full dosing of induction chemotherapy.","['Segal, Idit', 'Rassekh, S Rod', 'Bond, Mason C', 'Senger, Christof', 'Schreiber, Richard A']","['Segal I', 'Rassekh SR', 'Bond MC', 'Senger C', 'Schreiber RA']","[""Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia's Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alanine Transaminase/*blood', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/*blood', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hepatitis/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/*complications', 'Infant', 'Liver/enzymology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications/therapy']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22549 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Sep;55(3):434-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22549.,"['2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Among 433 Taiwanese children with ALL diagnosed at our hospitals between 1997 and 2007, the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion was found in 15.8%, and hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) in 14.1% of the patients. These frequencies were lower than those reported in the West, leading us to conduct a meta-analysis of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and hyperdiploidy frequencies in childhood ALL based on published reports. RESULTS: The frequency of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in the Far East (Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Chinese in Singapore, and Taiwan) was 13.4% (177/1,321, range: 9-23%, median 13%), significantly lower than the 22.8% (1,664/7,291, range: 19-26%, median 23%) in the West (West Europe and the United States) (P < 0.001, odds ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.7-2.4). Similarly, the frequency of hyperdiploidy in Japan and Taiwan was 14.3% (333/2,334, range: 12-20%, median 16%), significantly lower than the 25.2% in the West (5,173/20,510, range: 18-34%, median 23.5%; P < 0.001, odds ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.8-2.3).

The integral relationship of these genetic features with a favorable outcome in childhood ALL warrants further study of potentially important epidemiologic factors, including placental exposure to leukemogenic agents, and host pharmacogenetics.","['Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Liang, Sung-Tzu', 'Chang, Chia-Ling', 'Lee, En-Hui', 'Lai, Chung Liang', 'Chang, Wan-Hui']","['Liang DC', 'Shih LY', 'Yang CP', 'Hung IJ', 'Liu HC', 'Jaing TH', 'Yeh TC', 'Liang ST', 'Chang CL', 'Lee EH', 'Lai CL', 'Chang WH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. dcliang@ms2.mmh.org.tw']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asians/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*Diploidy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Far East', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'United States', 'Whites/genetics']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22628 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Sep;55(3):430-3. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22628.,"['2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that further improvements in survival are unlikely to be achieved with traditional approaches such as dose intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, since these therapies have been rigorously explored in clinical trials. This report highlights efforts to assess the response rates and survival outcomes after first or greater relapse in children with AML. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective cohort review of pediatric patients with relapsed and refractory AML (rAML) previously treated at TACL institutions between the years of 1995 and 2004. Data regarding disease characteristics at diagnosis and relapse, treatment response, and survival was collected on 99 patients and 164 medullary relapses or treatment failures. RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate following the second therapeutic attempt was 56 +/- 5%. CR rates following a third treatment attempt was 25 +/- 8% while 17 +/- 7% achieved CR following the fourth through sixth treatments. The 5-year disease-free survival in patients achieving CR following a second therapeutic attempt was 43 +/- 7%. The 5-year EFS and overall survival (OS) rates for all patients receiving a second treatment attempt was 24 +/- 5% and 29 +/- 5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This CR rate following a second therapeutic attempt and OS rate in patients with rAML is consistent with the literature. There are limited published data of CR rates for subsequent relapses. Our data can serve as a historical benchmark to compare outcomes of future therapeutic trials in rAML against traditional chemotherapy regimens.","['Gorman, Matthew F', 'Ji, Lingyun', 'Ko, Richard H', 'Barnette, Phillip', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Hutchinson, Raymond', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Twist, Clare J', 'Eckroth, Elena', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Loh, Mignon L']","['Gorman MF', 'Ji L', 'Ko RH', 'Barnette P', 'Bostrom B', 'Hutchinson R', 'Raetz E', 'Seibel NL', 'Twist CJ', 'Eckroth E', 'Sposto R', 'Gaynon PS', 'Loh ML']","['Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia Consortium, USC-CHLA Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],['K22 CA113557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22612 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Sep;55(3):421-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22612.,"['2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the outcome of children with AML who had CNS disease at diagnosis. METHODS: Patients enrolled on Children's Cancer Group protocols 2861, 2891, 2941, and 2961 being treated for de novo AML were classified for the presence of CNS disease at diagnosis as CNS1 (<5 WBC in the CSF without blasts), CNS2 (<5 WBC in the CSF with blasts), or CNS3 (> or =5 WBC in the CSF with blasts). CNS disease at diagnosis was then analyzed regarding patient characteristics and outcome. RESULTS: There was an incidence of CNS disease (i.e., CNS3 status) of 11% in the 1,459 patients analyzed in this study. The risk factors found are young age, high white cell count, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly at diagnosis, M4 subtype, chromosome 16 abnormalities, and hyperdiploid cytogenetics. There were no significant differences in overall survival, event free survival, or remission rates between the groups; however, a significant difference was seen between the CNS1 and CNS3 groups in disease free survival and isolated CNS relapse risk. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis have similar survival to those without CNS disease, although they have an increased incidence of isolated CNS relapse. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis may warrant more aggressive CNS directed therapy.","['Johnston, Donna L', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Woods, William G']","['Johnston DL', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Lange BJ', 'Woods WG']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. djohnston@cheo.on.ca""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC2990693,['NIHMS218661'],2010/07/27 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22511 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Sep;55(3):414-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22511.,"['2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Sep;55(3):399-400.

The aim of this analysis was to investigate whether exposure to house painting or floor treatments before birth or during childhood increased the risk of childhood ALL. Data from 389 cases and 876 frequency-matched controls were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for study matching variables and potential confounders. Overall, there was little evidence of an increased risk with painting inside the house in the year before the pregnancy, during the pregnancy, or after the child's birth; however, the risk appeared to be increased in certain circumstances. The odds ratio (OR) for more than three rooms being painted during pregnancy was 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 2.80]. The OR for someone other than the parents painting inside the house in the year before the pregnancy was 2.37 (95% CI 1.30, 4.30) and 3.07 (95% CI 1.46, 6.46) when more than three rooms were painted. The OR for the mother painting the outside of the house with oil-based paint in the year before the pregnancy was 2.97 (95% CI 1.06, 8.33). No association was found with having floor treatments in any time period. We found some evidence of an increased risk of ALL associated with house painting. An apparently increased risk associated with someone other than the parents painting inside the house may be related to the amount of paint used and the intensity of the dose received.","['Bailey, Helen D', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Attia, John', 'Cole, Catherine', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Bailey HD', 'Milne E', 'de Klerk NH', 'Fritschi L', 'Attia J', 'Cole C', 'Armstrong BK']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia. helenb@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', '*Floors and Floorcoverings', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Paint/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25572 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 May 15;128(10):2405-14. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25572.,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,,['Aus-ALL Consortium'],,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic and immunogenetic analyses were performed in a series of 105 HCL patients to estimate prevalence of multiple IG light chain expression by the tumour cells. By phenotype, 3/105 HCL (2.9%) expressed double tumour-related Ig kappa (K) and L light chain proteins. By immunogenetic analysis, functional mutated double IGK(I) /IGK(II) , IGK(I) /IGL(I) and IGL(I) /IGL(II) transcripts were cloned and sequenced in 3/71 (4.2%) HCL. These latter three HCL expressed multiple IGH isotypes with mutated IGHVDJ rearrangements at the time of AID transcript expression. Most interestingly, the three cases had reinduced RAG1 transcript.

The main focus of cancer genetics is the study of mutations that are causally implicated in tumorigenesis. The identification of such causal mutations does not only provide insight into cancer biology but also presents anticancer therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. In this study, we evaluated the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that can alter the expression and the function in MLL gene through computational methods. We applied an evolutionary perspective to screen the SNPs using a sequence homologybased SIFT tool, suggested that 10 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) (50%) were found to be deleterious. Structure based approach PolyPhen server suggested that 5 nsSNPS (25%) may disrupt protein function and structure. PupaSuite tool predicted the phenotypic effect of SNPs on the structure and function of the affected protein. Structure analysis was carried out with the major mutations that occurred in the native protein coded by MLL gene is at amino acid positions Q1198P and K1203Q. The solvent accessibility results showed that 7 residues changed from exposed state in the native type protein to buried state in Q1198P mutant protein and remained unchanged in the case of K1203Q. From the overall results obtained, nsSNP with id (rs1784246) at the amino acid position Q1198P could be considered as deleterious mutation in the acute leukemia caused by MLL gene.","['George Priya Doss, C', 'Rajasekaran, R', 'Sethumadhavan, Rao']","['George Priya Doss C', 'Rajasekaran R', 'Sethumadhavan R']","['Bioinformatics Division, School of BioSciences and Technology, VIT University, Vellore, 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100725,Germany,Interdiscip Sci,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",101515919,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acids/*analysis', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Software', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2009/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12539-010-0007-z [doi]'],ppublish,Interdiscip Sci. 2010 Sep;2(3):247-55. doi: 10.1007/s12539-010-0007-z.

The routine histology was not typical in both patients, with features of liquefaction degeneration of the basal cell layer and subbasilar lymphocytic infiltration. Important differential diagnoses for the two cases include lichenoid eruption secondary to chemotherapy, pemphigus, and pemphigoid. Immunohistologic testing played an essential role in the diagnoses. Direct immunofluorescence shows both intercellular and basement membrane deposition of immunoreactants.

However, attempts to implement this approach in clinical flow cytometry laboratories have been problematic; many commercially available antibodies give unreliable results. Assessment of ZAP70 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in chronic lymphocytic leukemia tissue sections is an easy, alternative approach, although lack of quantitation and subjective interpretation of results are potential pitfalls. In this study, we correlated ZAP70 protein expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry, with ZAP70 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript expression, assessed by semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, with the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Expression of ZAP70 protein and mRNA transcripts correlated strongly (P=8.238 x 10(-12)). Expression of ZAP70 protein and mRNA transcripts also correlated strongly with the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes (P=0.000071 and P=0.00076, respectively). Further, ZAP70 positivity by immunohistochemistry was associated with an increased risk of progression to therapy requirement (3-year risk 83% vs 31% for ZAP70 negative by immunohistochemistry, P=0.03). These results show that ZAP70 expression assessed by immunohistochemistry is a reliable surrogate marker of the somatic mutation status of the IGHV genes, and predicts time to progression.","['Admirand, Joan H', 'Knoblock, Ronald J', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Schlette, Ellen J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Keating, Michael J', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['Admirand JH', 'Knoblock RJ', 'Coombes KR', 'Tam C', 'Schlette EJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Ferrajoli A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating MJ', 'Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA123252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123252-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA123252-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100723,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Texas', 'Time Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*analysis/genetics']",PMC2966512,['NIHMS217756'],2010/07/27 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2010131 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2010.131 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2010 Nov;23(11):1518-23. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2010.131.

The data suggesting poor median survival of these patients may indicate that they should be primary candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, evidence on efficiency of this treatment modality in CML with T315I mutation is lacking. CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old patient was diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in accelerated phase. As he did not have an HLA-identical sibling or fully-matched unrelated bone marrow donor, treatment with low dose tyrosine kinase inhibitor - imatinib was initiated. Despite satisfactory hematological remission, he failed to achieve complete cytogenetic remission within the first year of treatment. Moreover, despite escalation of imatinib dosage, the disease relapsed after further 3 months of treatment. Molecular studies revealed T315I mutation of BCR/ABL gene. He responded poorly to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and we decided to perform alloSCT from a partially mismatched (8/10 HLA allele match) unrelated donor. The course of transplantation was complicated by staphylococcal sepsis, grade I skin acute GvHD and limited chronic skin GVHD. However, the goal of alloSCT was achieved and the patient remains in complete molecular remission at week +68 post-transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of this case supports the idea that allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation is a viable treatment option for patients with CML bearing T315I mutation.","['Basak, Grzegorz', 'Torosian, Tigran', 'Snarski, Emilian', 'Niesiobedzka, Joanna', 'Majewski, Miroslaw', 'Gronkowska, Anna', 'Urbanowska, Elzbieta', 'Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw']","['Basak G', 'Torosian T', 'Snarski E', 'Niesiobedzka J', 'Majewski M', 'Gronkowska A', 'Urbanowska E', 'Jedrzejczak W']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. gbasak@ib.amwaw.edu.pl']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Transplant,Annals of transplantation,9802544,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*Genes, abl', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['880943 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Transplant. 2010 Apr-Jun;15(2):68-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a modified culture medium containing human recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor and human basic fibroblast growth factor that significantly increases the number of human blastocysts formed and their quality, as well as the efficiency of HESC derivation from poor-quality embryos. Culturing poor-quality embryos in modified medium resulted in a two-fold increase in the blastocyst formation rate and a seven-fold increase over the derivation efficiency in conventional medium. We derived 15 HESC lines from poor-quality embryos cultured in modified culture medium and two HESC lines from quality embryos cultured in conventional culture medium. All cell lines shared typical human pluripotent stem cell features including similar morphology, normal karyotypes, expression of alkaline phosphatase, pluripotency genes, such as Oct4, and cell surface markers (SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81), the ability to form teratomas in SCID mice, and the ability to differentiate into cells of three embryonic germ layers in vitro.

NG2 reactivity correlated with FAB-M5 (50% positive cases, with an average of 32% NG2(+) cells), as well as with 11q23 aberrations. We detected NG2(+) cells in AML cases with normal karyotype, however, not in healthy BM cells. This means that NG2 qualifies as a reliable AML blast tumor marker, enabling monitoring of the course of AML independently of, although often associated with, 11q23-aberrations. Patients with more than 10% NG2(+) cells showed a tendency to have a shorter progression-free survival (mean: 7 months) than patients with fewer than 10% NG2(+) cells (mean survival: 17 months; p=0.08). While 31% of the patients with NG2(+) cells responded to chemotherapy, 58% of the group with NG2(+) cells did not respond (p=0.047). In conclusion, NG2 detects many, but not all 11q23 aberrations and other cases without 11q23 aberrations.

Such induction of autophagy by As(2)O(3) appears to require activation of the MEK/ERK pathway but not the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin or JNK pathways. In efforts to understand the functional relevance of arsenic-induced autophagy, we found that pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy or molecular targeting of beclin 1 or Atg7 results in reversal of the suppressive effects of As(2)O(3) on leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic progenitors from acute myelogenous leukemia patients. Altogether, our data provide direct evidence that autophagic cell death is critical for the generation of the effects of As(2)O(3) on acute myelogenous leukemia cells and raise the potential of modulation of elements of the autophagic machinery as an approach to enhance the antitumor properties of As(2)O(3) and possibly other heavy metal derivatives.","['Goussetis, Dennis J', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Glaser, Heather', 'McNeer, Jennifer L', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Goussetis DJ', 'Altman JK', 'Glaser H', 'McNeer JL', 'Tallman MS', 'Platanias LC']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University Medical School and Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA070085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA070085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA77816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100723,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Atg7 protein, mouse)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Beclin-1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism']",PMC2943259,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)89035-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.090530 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Sep 24;285(39):29989-97. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.090530.

Discouraging treatment outcomes may be related to perineural spread, loco regional invasion, and an unusually high incidence of metastatic potential. It presents a number of challenges related to facial nerve management and disease extension into surrounding soft tissue and bony compartments. ACC mostly occurring in the major and minor salivary glands, has some unique characteristics such as slow growth, diffuse invasion, and high incidence of distant metastasis. It is a high malignant carcinoma characterized by intensive local invasion and insidious distant metastasis to the lung at an early stage, which is responsible for a poor long-term survival rate. The main clinical treatment to adenoid cystic carcinoma depended on surgical operation in the past. However, it was not so easy to completely excise adenoid cystic carcinoma which resulting in the residual of tumor cells. Therefore, radiotherapy was often used after the operation. Radiotherapy alone cannot achieve the goal of radical cure, but operation combined with radiotherapy can evidently reduce the post-operative recurrence rate and increase the survival rate. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is not sensitive to conventional chemotherapeutics, so it is necessary to explore a new kind of drug which possesses inhibition and killing effects to this tumor. Arsenic trioxide (A(S2)O(3), ATO), a trivalent inorganic arsenite, has been proved to be an effective therapeutic agent against acute promyelocytic leukemia. Numerous reports have revealed that arsenite exerts its therapeutic activity by induction of apoptosis. It also induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells over a wide dose range. A(S2)O(3) may become a treatment option for adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland.","['Fu, Zhao-Chen', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Fu, Zhao-Jun']","['Fu ZC', 'Zhang B', 'Fu ZJ']","['The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Second Hospital Affiliated to Harbin Medical University, 246 Xue Fu Road, Nangang District, Harbin 150086, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100724,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic/*drug therapy', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(10)00229-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2010 Dec;75(6):490-1. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.07.001.

Because TIM-4 is expressed by macrophages and dendritic cells in human tissue, we examined its expression in a range of histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms and found moderate to strong immunohistochemical staining in cases of juvenile xanthogranuloma and histiocytic sarcoma, and lower level staining in interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, acute monocytic leukemia (leukemia cutis), and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (hematodermic tumor). TIM-3 was first described on activated T(H)1 cells but was recently shown to also be a phosphatidylserine receptor and mediate phagocytosis. We found TIM-3 was expressed by peritoneal macrophages, monocytes and splenic dendritic cells. We found that it, like TIM-4, is expressed in a range of histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms, typically with strong immunohistochemical staining. Cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, metastatic malignant melanoma, and metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma generally exhibited negative to minimal heterogenous staining for TIM-4 and TIM-3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EphA and ephrin A gene expression by mouse hematopoietic stem cells and the progenitor cell line FDCP-1 was determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. The effect of ephrin A activation on adhesion of hematopoietic progenitors was determined by in vitro adhesion assays in which cells were exposed to fibronectin or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and an increasing gradient of immobilized EphA3-Fc. Adhesion to fibronectin and VCAM-1 was further investigated using soluble preclustered EphA3-Fc. We used soluble unclustered EphA3-Fc as an antagonist to block endogenous EphA-ephrin A interactions in vivo. The effect of injecting soluble EphA3-Fc on the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells was examined. We determined the effect on short-term homing by pretreating bone marrow cells with EphA3-Fc or the control IgG before infusion into lethally irradiated mice. RESULTS: Preclustered and immobilized EphA3-Fc increased adhesion of progenitor cells and FDCP-1 to fibronectin and VCAM-1 (1.6- to 2-fold higher adhesion; p < 0.05) relative to control (0 mu/cm(2) EphA3-Fc extracellular molecule alone). Injection of the antagonist soluble EphA3-Fc increased progenitor cell and colony-forming unit-spleen cells in the peripheral blood (42% greater colony-forming unit in culture; p < 0.05, 3.8-fold higher colony-forming unit-spleen) relative to control. CONCLUSION: Treating bone marrow cells with EphA3-Fc resulted in a reduction by 31% in donor stem cells homing to the bone marrow and accumulation of donor cells in recipient spleens (50% greater than control) and greater recovery of donor stem cells from the peripheral blood.","['Ting, Michael J', 'Day, Bryan W', 'Spanevello, Mark D', 'Boyd, Andrew W']","['Ting MJ', 'Day BW', 'Spanevello MD', 'Boyd AW']","['Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland Research Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia. m.ting@uq.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100723,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ephrin-A3)', '0 (Ephrins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Eph Family)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Ephrin-A3/genetics/metabolism', 'Ephrins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptor, EphA3/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Eph Family/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2009/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00288-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Nov;38(11):1087-98. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.07.007.

Juglone, a major chemical constituent of Juglans mandshurica Maxim, possesses several bioactivities including anti-tumor. Here, for the first time, we studied the molecular mechanism of Juglone-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In the present study, HL-60 cells were incubated with Juglone at various concentrations. Occurrence of apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry. Expression of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results showed that Juglone inhibits the growth of human leukemia HL-60 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. Topical morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after Juglone treatment were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. The percentages of Annexin V-FITC-positive/PI negative cells were 7.81%, 35.46%, 49.11% and 66.02% with the concentrations of Juglone (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 microg/ml). Juglone could induce the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) loss, which preceded release of cytochrome c (Cyt c), Smac and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) to cell cytoplasm. A marked increased of Bax mRNA and protein appeared with Juglone treatment, while an evidently decreased of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein appeared at the same time. These events paralleled with activation of caspase-9, -3 and PARP cleavage. And the apoptosis induced by Juglone was blocked by z-LEHD-fmk, a caspase-9 inhibitor. Those results of our studies demonstrated that Juglone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HL-60 cells trigger events responsible for mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathways and the elevated ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was also probably involved in this effect.","['Xu, Hua-Li', 'Yu, Xiao-Feng', 'Qu, Shao-Chun', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Qu, Xiang-Ru', 'Chen, Yan-Ping', 'Ma, Xing-Yuan', 'Sui, Da-Yuan']","['Xu HL', 'Yu XF', 'Qu SC', 'Zhang R', 'Qu XR', 'Chen YP', 'Ma XY', 'Sui DY']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin Province, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100723,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'W6Q80SK9L6 (juglone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', '*Juglans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(10)00686-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.072 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Oct 25;645(1-3):14-22. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.072.

Methylation of key promoter regions, induced by cytotoxic therapy together with complex genetic changes, is important in the biology of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). We were interested in the characterization of the methylation pattern of AML and MDS de novo and therapy-related. We studied 385 patients (179 females, 206 males), of a median age of 66 years (range 16-98 years). There were 105 MDS, 208 de novo AML and 72 t-MN (45 MDS and 27 AML). Using a methylation-specific PCR, we studied the promoter methylation status of E-cadherin (CDH1), TSP1 and DAP-Kinase 1. These genes have been shown to be involved in the malignant transformation, interfering with angiogenesis, interaction with micro-environment, apoptosis and xenobiotic detoxification. We found no associations between promoter hypermethylation and gender or age at the time of initial diagnosis. In patients with MDS, there were no associations between hypermethylation and clinical characteristics, including IPSS score, WHO classification and cytogenetics. DAPK1 was more frequently methylated in t-MDS/AML when compared to de novo MDS and AML (39% vs 15.3% and 24.4%, p=0.0001), while methylation of CDH1 was similar in t-MDS/AML and AML (51% and 53.4%), but less frequent in de novo MDS (29%) (p=0.003). In the t-MDS/AML group, we found that the methylation pattern appeared to be related to the primary tumor, with DAPK1 more frequently methylated in patients with a previous lymphoproliferative disease (75% vs 32%, p=0.006). On the other hand, methylation of CDH1 was associated to radiotherapy for the primary malignancy (84.5% vs 38%, p=0.003). TSP1 hypermethylation was rare and not characteristic of t-MDS/AML. In 177 patients studied for concurrent methylation of several promoters, t-MN and AML de novo were significantly more frequently hypermethylated in 2 or more promoter regions than de novo MDS (20% vs 12.4%, p<0.001). Chemotherapy and individual genetic predisposition have a role in t-MDS/AML development, the identification of specific epigenetic modifications may explain complexity and genomic instability of these diseases and give the basis for targeted-therapy. The significant association with previous malignancy subtypes may underlie a likely susceptibility to methylation of specific targets and a role for constitutional epimutations as predisposing factors for the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm.","['Greco, Mariangela', ""D'Alo, Francesco"", 'Scardocci, Alessandra', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Fabiani, Emiliano', 'Guidi, Francesco', 'Di Ruscio, Annalisa', 'Migliara, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Hohaus, Stefan', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Voso, Maria Teresa']","['Greco M', ""D'Alo F"", 'Scardocci A', 'Criscuolo M', 'Fabiani E', 'Guidi F', 'Di Ruscio A', 'Migliara G', 'Pagano L', 'Fianchi L', 'Chiusolo P', 'Hohaus S', 'Leone G', 'Voso MT']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100724,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Thrombospondin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD', '*Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Cadherins', '*Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', '*DNA Methylation', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Thrombospondin 1']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(10)00150-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2010 Oct 15;45(3):181-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.05.008.

Investigating the aggregation of cancer in couples might provide valuable insights into cancer development. METHODS: The 2008 update of the Swedish Family-Cancer Database includes over 2 million couples with at least one child in common with one single partner. We quantified the contribution of shared adulthood environment by standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs). Estimated SIRs were used to build an etiological map reflecting the similarity of cancers by adult environmental exposures. RESULTS: Increased risks of concordant types amongst spouses were found for lung, upper aerodigestive tract and skin cancers (SIRs from 1.24 to 1.97),which are probably related to shared exposure to smoking and UV radiation. PAFs were low with the highest value of 1.46% for uterus cancer in wives of men affected by prostate cancer. Further analysis, based on all non-sex-specific concordant and discordant types, revealed a clustering of lung, stomach, pancreas and bladder cancers sharing smoking as a risk factor. This aggregation was used as a cut-point to identify further ""novel"" clusters. CONCLUSION: Shared lifestyles including smoking and drinking habits as well as human papilloma virus infection (HPV) might be associated with an excess of cancer incidence amongst spouses. We observed significantly an increased risk for smoking-related cancers such as lung, upper aerodigestive tract and oesophageal cancers. The present population-based study confirms that the lifestyle shared by spouses plays a minor role in cancer causation. Only strong environmental risk factors such as smoking seem to influence cancer development in adulthood. The proposed etiological map based on 24 cancer types identifies novel clusters--for example, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukaemia, bone cancer and myeloma--that are not completely explained by established risk factors. Some of the identified clusters relied on reproduced associations between cancer risks amongst husband and wives; however, the role of chance cannot be excluded.","['Weires, Marianne', 'Bermejo, Justo Lorenzo', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Weires M', 'Bermejo JL', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. m.weires@dkfz.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100723,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Spouses/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)00641-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.06.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 Jan;47(1):98-106. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.06.125.

We generated a panel of murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env mutants and analyzed their ability to be recruited to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) assembly sites. Surprisingly, the entire CTD was dispensable for recruitment to assembly sites, but a mutation that disrupted the furin cleavage site in Env abolished recruitment. To determine if MLV Env can show selectivity for homologous assembly sites, cells were co-transfected with both HIV-1 and MLV assembly components along with each MLV Env construct and assayed for infectious particle production. MLV Env selectively formed infectious particles with the MLV components at the expense of infectious HIV-1 infectious particle production, but truncation of the CTD progressively reduced this selectivity. Collectively these data suggest that there are two separable mechanisms that govern MLV Env recruitment to viral assembly sites.","['Lucas, Tiffany M', 'Lyddon, Terri D', 'Grosse, Sarah A', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Lucas TM', 'Lyddon TD', 'Grosse SA', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Christopher S.

A normal serum albumin level generally denotes healthiness. We evaluated the prognostic significance of day 90 hypoalbuminemia (and other clinical, pharmacologic, and laboratory variables) in 163 patients, median age 48 years (range, 19-69 years), who underwent allo-HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 124) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 39). Day 90 hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL) was associated with worse nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and poor overall survival (OS). The estimated 1- and 2-year cumulative incidence rates of NRM were 48% and 52%, respectively, and the corresponding OS rates were 7% and 3%. Serum albumin level <3.0 g/dL and Karnofsky score <80 at day 90 were strong independent predictors of worse NRM and OS in multivariate analysis.

The detection technology is based on atomic mass spectrometry. It offers quantitation, specificity and dynamic range of mass spectrometry in a format that is familiar to flow cytometry practitioners. The mass cytometer does not require compensation, allowing the application of statistical techniques; this has been impossible given the constraints of fluorescence noise with traditional cytometry instruments. Instead of ""colors"" the mass cytometer ""reads"" the stable isotope tags attached to antibodies using metal-chelating labeling reagents. Because there are many available stable isotopes, and the mass spectrometer provides exquisite resolution between detection channels, many parameters can be measured as easily as one. For example, in a single tube the technique allows for the ready detection and characterization of the major cell subsets in blood or bone marrow. Here we describe mass cytometric immunophenotyping of human leukemia cell lines and leukemia patient samples, differential cell analysis of normal peripheral and umbilical cord blood; intracellular protein identification and metal-encoded bead arrays.","['Ornatsky, Olga', 'Bandura, Dmitry', 'Baranov, Vladimir', 'Nitz, Mark', 'Winnik, Mitchell A', 'Tanner, Scott']","['Ornatsky O', 'Bandura D', 'Baranov V', 'Nitz M', 'Winnik MA', 'Tanner S']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George St., Toronto ON, Canada M5S 3H6; DVS Sviences Inc., 70 Peninsula Cr., Richmond Hill, ON L4S1Z5, Canada. olga.ornatsky@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],['R01-GM076127/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100721,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Lanthanoid Series Elements)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Chelating Agents/*chemistry', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/instrumentation/*methods', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mass Spectrometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Microspheres']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-1759(10)00198-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2010.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2010 Sep 30;361(1-2):1-20. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2010.07.002.

In this method, a cell lysis agent was combined with a fluorescent probe for nucleic acid which exclusively passes through the disrupted membranes of dead cells but not intact membranes of viable cells. The distinctive feature of this probe is to possess a large fluorescence enhancement (460-fold) on binding to nucleic acid despite very low intrinsic fluorescence. In this fluorometric assay based on cell lysis and staining (FACLS), the fluorescence intensity was linearly related to total tumour cell number. This FACLS was also used to evaluate the chemosensitivity of MOLT-4 human leukaemia cells and to measure cell viability. The results were similar to those obtained by MTT colorimetric and trypan blue exclusion assays. The main advantage of this assay is its ability to measure simultaneously both cell viability and cell growth rapidly (within about 5min) and simply (two steps) with validation of cell culture conditions in each microplate. This method could be widely applicable to cytotoxic evaluation of anticancer drugs and other chemicals.","['Kato, F', 'Tanaka, M', 'Nakamura, K']","['Kato F', 'Tanaka M', 'Nakamura K']","['Medicinal Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd, 2-3-1, Nishi-shibukawa, Kusatsu, Shiga 5250025, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,,,,,1999/12/01 00:00,1999/12/01 00:01,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['1999/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1999/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(99)00078-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(99)00078-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 1999 Dec;13(6):923-9. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(99)00078-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon withdrawal of LIF, these cells differentiate into various cell types under appropriate conditions. This property of ES cells allowed us to develop an in vitro embryotoxicity test, the Embryonic Stem Cell Test (EST; In Vitro Toxicology 1997, 10, 119-127), which does not require taking embryonic cells or tissues from pregnant animals. In the EST, the effect of test chemicals on three endpoints is assessed: inhibition of the differentiation of ES cells into contracting myocard, cytotoxicity in ES cells and cytotoxicity in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, which are serving as differentiated cells in the test. The results of a prevalidation study of the EST are described, which was conducted according to the ECVAM prevalidation scheme. In the first stage of the study (Phase I), a standard operating procedure (SOP) was elaborated. In the second phase (Phase II), the interlaboratory transferability of the EST was assessed using three test chemicals representing three classes of embryotoxicity (a strong, a weak and a non-embryotoxic chemical) in two European laboratories (ZEBET at the BgVV in Berlin, Germany; ECVAM at the JRC in Ispra, Italy) and one US laboratory (Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS) in Gaithersburgh, MA, USA). In the final stage of prevalidation (Phase III), nine test chemicals and a positive control were tested under blind conditions at ZEBET and ECVAM. The statistical evaluation of the results led to the development of an improved prediction model for the EST.","['Scholz, G', 'Genschow, E', 'Pohl, I', 'Bremer, S', 'Paparella, M', 'Raabe, H', 'Southee, J', 'Spielmann, H']","['Scholz G', 'Genschow E', 'Pohl I', 'Bremer S', 'Paparella M', 'Raabe H', 'Southee J', 'Spielmann H']","['Center for Documentation and Evaluation of Alternative Methods to Animal Experiments (ZEBET), Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veterinary Medicine (BgVV), Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,,,,,1999/08/01 00:00,1999/08/01 00:01,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1999/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/08/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(99)00046-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(99)00046-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 1999 Aug-Oct;13(4-5):675-81. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(99)00046-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Routine histological examination was performed on hematoxylin-eosin stained sections of 24 bone marrow biopsies and available 6 concurrent lymph node specimens. Immunohistochemistry study was performed using EliVision methods. RESULTS: Among 24 cases, the male-to-female ratio was 2.4:1 and the median age was 59.5 years (42 - 75). The most common symptom was weakness (83.3%, 20/24). Hyperviscosity and ""B"" symptoms occurred in 20.8% (5/24) and 8.3% (2/24) respectively. 41.7% (10/24) patients presented with lymphadenopathy. Anemia, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were seen in 79.2% (19/24), 8.3% (2/24) and 37.5% (9/24) respectively. Monoclonal Ig light chain expression was detected by serum immunofixation electrophoresis in 23 cases (95.8%), including IgM (20 cases), IgG (2 cases) and IgA (1 case). Basing on the histology and immunohistochemistry findings, the diagnosis was made in 22 bone marrow and 2 lymph node biopsies, respectively. Histologically, the bone marrow and lymph node specimens composed of small lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most frequent pattern of bone marrow involvement was diffuse in appearance (63.6%, 14/22), while nodular and interstitial patterns were less common (22.7%, 5/22 and 13.6%, 3/22, respectively). Lymph node involvement was also to be diffuse in pattern. The proliferative cells expressed Pax5, CD20, CD38 and CD138, but were negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, CyclinD1, CD3, CD7 and MPO. CONCLUSIONS: LPL has distinct clinicopathological features. Histological and immunohistochemistry findings are important for its differential diagnosis with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.

METHODS: Retrospective case series. Twenty nine patients (40 eyes) with retinoblastoma were accepted customized combined therapy between Jan. 2005 and Dec. 2007 in our hospital. The combined therapy included chemoreduction using vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin (VEC) combined with local cryotherapy and/or transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT). The average follow-up duration was 38 months and ranging from 12 to 50 months. RESULTS: Twenty five patients had bilateral retinoblastoma, 4 patients had unilateral retinoblastoma. The stages of 40 eyes were classified according to the International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification, 14 eyes (35%) were group A, 9 eyes (22.5%) were group B, 4 eyes (10%) were group C, 10 eyes (25%) were group D, and 3 eyes (7.5%) were group E. Seventeen eyes had vitreous and/or subretinal seeds. The overall globe preservation rate was 75% (30/40); and was 100% (14/14) in group A, 100% (9/9) in group B, 75% (3/4) in group C, 40% (4/10) in group D and 0% (0/3) in group E. A progressive decrease of globe preservation rate was observed in eyes with advanced stages. Tumor recurrence was detected in 4 eyes after chemoreduction, leading to the enucleation. Ten eyes were enucleated in the present series, with 1 eye in group C, 6 eyes in group D and 3 eyes in group E. None of 29 patients died during the follow-up.

The aim of this study was to investigate the tolerability of 6-MP and to optimize thiopurine use. METHODS: The authors evaluated in a prospective manner the tolerance of 6-MP in ALL children from Oct. 1, 2004 to Sept. 30, 2007 who were newly diagnosed in Beijing Children's Hospital, using BCH-ALL-2003 protocols, during the maintenance therapy and followed up to Sept. 30, 2008. All children had a treatment period of at least 3 months for maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Totally 133 children including 81 boys and 52 girls at median age of 67 months (18 - 188 months), 100% of the patients went into complete remission (CR) on day 33 of induction chemotherapy, and the median time to CR was 26 months (6 - 47 months). All the children had maintenance therapy from 3 to 25 months (mean 13.5 +/- 7.4) and 72(54%) received 6-MP standard doses continuously for total courses, the median daily dose of 6-MP was 46 mg/(m(2).d) 6-MP, their WBC was (3 - 4) x 10(9)/L, ANC (1.5 - 2) x 10(9)/L, they had no severe liver toxicity. In 4 children the dose of 6-MP was increased to 125% because WBC was higher than 6 x 10(9)/L, ANC higher than 3 x 10(9)/L. Sixty one children (46%) had poor tolerability to 6-MP, they experienced adverse events that led to discontinuation (n = 19) or dose reduction (n = 42) of 6-MP, the actual mean dose for the 42 cases was 25 - 30 mg/(m(2).d) and the time to occurrence of toxic effects was 2.5 weeks. Reasons for discontinuation or dose reduction were severe myelotoxicity occurred in 48 children, hepatotoxicity in 12, and skin rash in one. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of ALL children, the difference of tolerance to oral 6-MP was obvious, 54% of the children well tolerated 6-MP during the whole course at oral standard dose, and severe granulocytopenia did not occur. However, 46% developed severe granulopenia or hepatotoxicity, the dosage had to be reduced in order to decrease the probability of severe toxicity. It is suggested that standard dose of 6-MP is not always the maximum tolerant dose in some children and inadequate dose may be the cause of therapy failure.","['Ma, Xiao-li', 'Wang, Bin', 'Guo, Hai-ying', 'Zhang, Yong-hong', 'Zhu, Guang-hua', 'Duan, Yan-long', 'Yang, Jing', 'Zhang, Da-wei', 'Jin, Ling', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Zhang, Li', 'Xie, Jin', 'Wu, Min-yuan']","['Ma XL', 'Wang B', 'Guo HY', 'Zhang YH', 'Zhu GH', 'Duan YL', 'Yang J', 'Zhang DW', 'Jin L', 'Zhang R', 'Zhang L', 'Xie J', 'Wu MY']","[""Hematology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['chi'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2010 Apr;48(4):289-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) In this group, there were no significant differences in treatment phases when the death occurred among patients with leukemia (56 cases), lymphoma (9 cases) and other non-hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumors (7 cases, chi(2) = 4.784, P = 0.310). (3) The infection related death increased significantly when WBC count was lower than 1.0 x 10(9)/L, which is totally different from those whose WBC was higher than or equal to 1.0 x 10(9)/L (chi(2) = 25.486, P < 0.001). (4) Twenty-six cases were detected to be infected with definite pathogens; different pathogens were identified 36 times in the 26 patients. Gram-negative bacteria (15/36, 41.7%) were the most common pathogens, followed by fungal organisms (14/36, 38.9%) and gram-positive bacteria (7/36, 19.4%). CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of cancer therapy related complications in children with malignant tumors. Infection was the leading cause of death, gram-negative bacteria and fungi were predominating pathogens. Application of effective antibiotics and combined antifungal drugs timely, especially in the remission induction or first chemotherapy period as well as in the period of neutropenia, may reduce mortality of children with malignant tumors significantly.","['Wang, Xiao-xia', 'Tang, Jing-yan', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Xue, Hui-liang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Shen, Shu-hong', 'Dong, Lu', 'Zhou, Min', 'Ye, Qi-dong', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Luo, Chang-ying']","['Wang XX', 'Tang JY', 'Gu LJ', 'Xue HL', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Shen SH', 'Dong L', 'Zhou M', 'Ye QD', 'Jiang H', 'Luo CY']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*mortality']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2010 Apr;48(4):284-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the end-replication problem, telomere repeats are lost with each cell division, eventually leading to genetic instability and cellular senescence when telomeres become critically short. Stabilization of the telomeric DNA through telomerase activation, unique reverse transcriptase, or activation of the alternative mechanism of telomere maintenance is essential if the cells are to survive and proliferate indefinitely. Telomerase is expressed during early development and remains fully active in specific germline cells, but is undetectable in most normal somatic cells. High level of telomerase activity is detected in almost 90% of human tumours and immortalized cell lines. The hematopoietic compartment may develop genetic instability as a consequence of telomere erosion, resulting in aplastic anaemia (AA) and increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Genetic instability associated with telomere dysfunction (i.e. short telomeres) is an early event in carcinogenesis. The molecular cytogenetic method telomere/centromere fluorescence in situ hybridization (T/C-FISH) can be used to characterize the telomere length of hematopoietic cells. This review describes recent advances in the molecular characterization of telomere system, the regulation of telomerase activity in cancer pathogenesis and shows that the telomeric length could be a potential clinical marker of hematologic neoplasia and prognosis of disease.","['Gancarcikova, M', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Brezinova, J', 'Berkova, A', 'Vcelikova, S', 'Smigova, J', 'Michalova, K']","['Gancarcikova M', 'Zemanova Z', 'Brezinova J', 'Berkova A', 'Vcelikova S', 'Smigova J', 'Michalova K']","['Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Center of Oncocytogenetics, Prague, Czech Republic. marketa.z@centrum.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Prague Med Rep,Prague medical report,101227436,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Telomerase/genetics/*physiology', 'Telomere/genetics/*physiology']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/08/27 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['PMR2010A0010 [pii]'],ppublish,Prague Med Rep. 2010;111(2):91-105.,,,,,,,,,,88,,,,,,

The action of diplacone was also compared with that of conventional drug indomethacin. Human monocyte-derived macrophages of the human monocytic leukaemia cell line were pretreated with diplacone or indomethacin. Subsequently, inflammatory reaction was induced by lipopolysaccharide, and changes of tumour necrosis factor alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and zinc finger protein 36 gene expression at the transcriptional level were measured. In this model, diplacone significantly down-regulated the expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and up-regulated the zinc finger protein 36 expression. This makes diplacone a promising molecule for treatment of the inflammatory stage of diseases.

Hypercalcemia and bone lesions due to osteoclast-mediated bone resorption are frequently associated with more aggressive forms of the disease. The HTLV-1 provirus contains a unique antisense gene that expresses HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ). HBZ is localized to the nucleus where it regulates levels of transcription by binding to certain cellular transcriptional regulators. Among its protein targets, HBZ forms a stable complex with the homologous cellular coactivators, p300 and CBP, which is modulated through two N-terminal LXXLL motifs in the viral protein and the conserved KIX domain in the coactivators. RESULTS: To determine the effects of these interactions on transcription, we performed a preliminary microarray analysis, comparing levels of gene expression in cells with wild-type HBZ versus cells with HBZ mutated in its LXXLL motifs. DKK1, which encodes the secreted Wnt signaling inhibitor, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), was confirmed to be transcriptionally activated by HBZ, but not its mutant. Dkk1 plays a major role in the development of bone lesions caused by multiple myeloma. In parallel with the initial findings, activation of Dkk1 expression by HBZ was abrogated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of p300/CBP or by a truncated form of p300 containing the KIX domain. Among HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines tested, the detection of Dkk1 mRNA partially correlated with a threshold level of HBZ mRNA. In addition, an uninfected and an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line transfected with an HBZ expression vector exhibited de novo and increased DKK1 transcription, respectively. In contrast to HBZ, The HTLV-1 Tax protein repressed Dkk1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that HBZ activates Dkk1 expression through its interaction with p300/CBP. However, this effect is limited in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, which in part, may be due to suppression of Dkk1 expression by Tax. Consequently, the ability of HBZ to regulate expression of Dkk1 and possibly other cellular genes may only be significant during late stages of ATL, when Tax expression is repressed.","['Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Gregory, Heather', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Polakowski N', 'Gregory H', 'Mesnard JM', 'Lemasson I']","['East Carolina University, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27834, USA. polakowskin@ecu.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA128800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA128800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100723,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DKK1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Resorption', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC2918529,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-61 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-61 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Jul 23;7:61. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, emerging evidence from various laboratories, including ours, suggests that protein misfolding may also play a fundamental role in some malignancies, particularly those caused by fusion oncoprotein generated from chromosomal translocation. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) fused to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a fusion oncoprotein linked to the transformation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and is not only a misfolded protein itself, but also promotes misfolding of nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) protein, a corepressor essential for the growth-suppressive function of several tumor-suppressor proteins. PML-RAR promotes misfolding of N-CoR by inducing aberrant post-translational modification, which destabilizes its core and promotes instability. Misfolded N-CoR, thus, contributes to differentiation arrest and survival of APL cells through loss-of-function and aberrant gain-of-function properties. Therapeutic restoration of N-CoR conformation and function with conformation-modifying agents not only releases this differentiation arrest but also sensitizes APL cells to programmed cell death. These findings illustrate the potential of the misfolded N-CoR protein as a conformation-based drugable molecular target for APL, and highlights the promise of various conformation-modifying agents as novel therapeutics for APL. Protein conformational rearrangement, resulting from an inherited or acquired genetic alteration, could be a common pathological phenomenon contributing to transformation in different types of leukemias and solid tumors and, therefore, could serve as a common ground for designing a unifying diagnostic as well as therapeutic approach for a widely diverse disease such as cancer. To that end, APL could serve as a model for the development of a novel conformation-based therapeutic approach for other malignant diseases.","['Khan, Matiullah']",['Khan M'],"['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI) and Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Center for Life Sciences, Block MD11, Singapore. csimmk@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,"['0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1/*chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry', 'Protein Folding']",,,2010/07/27 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/epr.10.38 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2010 Aug;7(4):591-600. doi: 10.1586/epr.10.38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proper formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is dependent on, and highly regulated by, a large number of clathrin assembly proteins.

In this study, we focus on two closely related clathrin assembly proteins, AP180 and CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein), in the developing embryonic rat brain. We find that AP180 begins to be expressed at embryonic day 14 (E14), but only in postmitotic cells that have acquired a neuronal fate. CALM, on the other hand, is expressed as early as E12, by both neural stem cells and postmitotic neurons. In vitro loss-of-function studies using RNA interference (RNAi) indicate that AP180 and CALM are dispensable for some aspects of embryonic neurogenesis but are required for the growth of postmitotic neurons. These results identify the developmental stage of AP180 and CALM expression and suggest that each protein has distinct functions in neural development.","['Schwartz, Catherine M', 'Cheng, Aiwu', 'Mughal, Mohamed R', 'Mattson, Mark P', 'Yao, Pamela J']","['Schwartz CM', 'Cheng A', 'Mughal MR', 'Mattson MP', 'Yao PJ']","['Laboratory of Neurosciences, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, USA.']",['eng'],['Z99 AG999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,J Comp Neurol,The Journal of comparative neurology,0406041,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Picalm protein, rat)', '0 (clathrin assembly protein AP180)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Brain/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Clathrin/metabolism', 'Clathrin-Coated Vesicles/metabolism', '*Embryo, Mammalian/anatomy & histology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism']",PMC2909614,['NIHMS215726'],2010/07/24 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cne.22425 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comp Neurol. 2010 Sep 15;518(18):3803-18. doi: 10.1002/cne.22425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, complete remission (CR) was achieved in 20/30 patients (67%), while eight patients (27%) were refractory and two died of infectious complications. All refractory patients had unfavorable cytogenetics. All patients achieving CR were programmed to receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), which was actually performed in 11 patients. Our study suggest that D15 driven DI represents a feasible and effective therapeutic strategy in young adult AML patients, improving therapeutic results and not compromising feasibility of allo-SCT. When compared with conventional DI, it offers the potential to avoid unnecessary toxicity in a consistent proportion of patients.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Izzo, Tiziana', 'Criscuolo, Clelia', 'Riccardi, Cira', 'Celentano, Maria', 'Mele, Giuseppina']","['Ferrara F', 'Izzo T', 'Criscuolo C', 'Riccardi C', 'Celentano M', 'Mele G']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Via Nicolo Piccinni 6, Naples, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/24 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21791 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Sep;85(9):687-90. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21791.,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was to investigate the effect of IL-13 on the expression of glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb), a megakaryocytic gene, in Dami cells (human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line) and HEL cells (human erythroleukemic cell line, which has both erythroid and megakaryocytic markers). Furthermore, it addresses the mechanisms governing the regulation of GPIIb expression by IL-13. The molecular responses of Dami cells and HEL cells to IL-13 treatment were analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and flow cytometry analysis. We show that IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-4Ralpha are expressed in Dami cells and HEL cells. The expression of GPIIb was significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels by treatment with IL-13. Moreover, IL-13 induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6(STAT6). By using a STAT6-specific antibody and PCR primers designed to yield a product, which encompasses the STAT6 binding site of the GPIIb promoter, we have shown the binding of the IL-13-mediated activation of STAT6 to the promoter of GPIIb gene. These results broaden the involvement of IL-13 into megakaryocyte differentiation by STAT6 pathway.","['Shi, Xiaoyu', 'Cai, Wei', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Zhang, Xuejun', 'Xiong, Lixia', 'Li, Rong', 'Yu, Xuemei', 'Li, Wenlin']","['Shi X', 'Cai W', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang X', 'Xiong L', 'Li R', 'Yu X', 'Li W']","[""Department of Histology and Embryology, Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anat Rec (Hoboken),"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)",101292775,"['0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2010/07/24 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ar.21144 [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Rec (Hoboken). 2010 Sep;293(9):1470-6. doi: 10.1002/ar.21144.,"['2010.

In this study, we compared the rates of cataracts, diabetes, renal failure, vascular events, lymphoma, and leukemia among patients with and without persistent or chronic ITP. Using administrative data, adult patients with medical claims for ITP from January, 2000 through September, 2006 were identified. An age- and gender-matched comparison cohort without evidence of ITP was randomly selected. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of each comorbidity among ITP patients relative to the comparison group was estimated using Poisson regression, adjusting for baseline covariates. A total of 3,131 patients with persistent or chronic ITP were identified, and 9,392 were selected for the comparison cohort. The adjusted IRRs were as follows: diabetes 1.73 (95% CI 1.36-2.20), renal failure 2.05 (95% CI 1.67-2.51), any vascular event 1.70 (95% CI 1.41-2.05), lymphoma 5.91 (95% CI 2.61-13.37), leukemia 19.83 (95% CI 5.84-67.34), and mortality 4.21 (95% CI 3.06-5.79). There was no increased risk for cataract or myocardial infarction in the ITP cohort. Patients with persistent or chronic ITP are at increased risk for several comorbidities including hematologic malignancies, relative to a matched comparison cohort.","['Enger, Cheryl', 'Bennett, Dimitri', 'Forssen, Ulla', 'Fogarty, Patrick F', 'McAfee, Andrew T']","['Enger C', 'Bennett D', 'Forssen U', 'Fogarty PF', 'McAfee AT']","['i3 Drug Safety, 5430 Data Court, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, USA. cheryl.enger@i3drugsafety.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100724,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",,,2010/07/24 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0636-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Sep;92(2):289-95. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0636-3.
