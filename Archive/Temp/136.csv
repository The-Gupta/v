MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients receiving radiotherapy for head/neck cancer were included in this study. Patients were examined before radiotherapy. Oral mucositis was recorded weekly during radiotherapy. Cytologic smears from the oral cavity were taken with a brush. Immunocytochemical staining was performed by the use of p53, BCl-2, MCl-1 TNF and IL-1beta monoclonal antibodies. MAIN RESULTS: P53 was expressed in 1 of 15 smears before the initiation of radiotherapy (6.5%) compared to 3 of 7 smears from patients with grade III mucositis (43%) during radiotherapy. BCl-2 was expressed in 15 of 15 smears before radiotherapy (100%) and in three of seven patients with grade III mucositis (43%) during radiotherapy. MCl-1 was expressed in 10 of 14 samples before radiotherapy (71.5%) and in two of seven patients with grade III (28.5%) mucositis during radiotherapy. TNF was expressed in 9 of 14 patients before radiotherapy (64%) and in six of seven patients with grade III mucositis during radiotherapy (86%). IL-1beta was detected in 7 of 14 patients before radiotherapy (50%) compared to 6 of 7 patients with grade III mucositis during radiotherapy (86%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results indicate an induction of apoptosis and inflammation in the oral mucosa in patients developing mucositis during radiotherapy for head/neck cancer.","['Xanthinaki, Arsinoi', 'Nicolatou-Galitis, Ourania', 'Athanassiadou, Pavlina', 'Gonidi, Maria', 'Kouloulias, Vassilis', 'Sotiropoulou-Lontou, Anastasia', 'Pissakas, George', 'Kyprianou, Konstantinos', 'Kouvaris, John', 'Patsouris, Efstratios']","['Xanthinaki A', 'Nicolatou-Galitis O', 'Athanassiadou P', 'Gonidi M', 'Kouloulias V', 'Sotiropoulou-Lontou A', 'Pissakas G', 'Kyprianou K', 'Kouvaris J', 'Patsouris E']","['Dental Oncology Unit, Clinic of Hospital Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Athens, Athens, Greece. xanthinaki@yahoo.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080116,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*chemistry/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/*physiopathology', 'Interleukin-1beta/analysis', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stomatitis/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-007-0379-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2008 Sep;16(9):1025-33. doi: 10.1007/s00520-007-0379-8.

Current pediatric protocols for CD20+ B-cell lymphoma/leukemia significantly improve survival, but with major morbidity. To assess whether rituximab has efficacy in very high-grade pediatric disease, all published data on rituximab therapy for Burkitt's lymphoma/B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma were reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Three trials in adult Burkitt's/B-ALL showed a significant survival advantage when rituximab was added to standard chemotherapy. Minimal pediatric data have been published, but 19 children with mature B-cell lymphoma/B-ALL received rituximab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, as salvage therapy, after failure of intensive chemotherapy. Fifteen of 19 (79%) responded, 12 (63%) remained alive in continuous complete remission at 5+ to 48+ months of follow-up. Two patients were alive in partial remission. Five patients died, four of progressive disease. Only one patient had no response to rituximab. SUMMARY: Rituximab has demonstrated efficacy in Burkitt's disease in adults. Although positive reporting bias is suspected, it appears that rituximab, even as monotherapy, has efficacy in heavily pretreated pediatric patients with high-grade B-lymphoma/B-ALL. Rituximab use can be justified in a prospective controlled chemotherapy dose-reduction study.","['Attias, Dina', 'Weitzman, Sheila']","['Attias D', 'Weitzman S']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Bruce Rappoport Faculty of Medicine, Technion Institute, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOP.0b013e3282f424b0 [doi]', '00008480-200802000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2008 Feb;20(1):17-22. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3282f424b0.,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if CRP could be used to detect different remission states in dogs with lymphoma. ANIMALS: Twenty-two dogs with untreated multicentric lymphoma. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, before each chemotherapy session, and at follow-up visits, resulting in 287 serum samples. RESULTS: Before therapy, a statistically significant majority of the dogs (P = .0019) had CRP concentrations above the reference range (68%, 15/22). After achieving complete remission 90% (18/20) of the dogs had CRP concentrations within the reference range, and the difference in values before and after treatment was statistically significant (P < .001). CRP concentrations of dogs in complete remission (median, 1.91; range, 0.2-103) were significantly different (P = .031) from those of dogs with partial remission (median, 2.48; range, 0-89), stable disease (median, 1.77; range, 1.03-42.65), or progressive disease (median, 8.7; range, 0-82.5). There was profound variation of CRP measurements within each dog. CONCLUSIONS: CRP is useful in determining complete remission status after treatment with cytotoxic drugs. However, the individual variation between dogs means CRP concentration is not sufficiently different in other remission states to permit its use in monitoring progression of the disease. Greater reliability in determining remission status might be achieved by combining CRP concentration with other serum markers.","['Nielsen, Lise', 'Toft, Nils', 'Eckersall, P David', 'Mellor, Dominic J', 'Morris, Joanna S']","['Nielsen L', 'Toft N', 'Eckersall PD', 'Mellor DJ', 'Morris JS']","['University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Glasgow, United Kingdom. lini@life.ku.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Dog Diseases/*blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/metabolism/*veterinary']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1892/07-058.1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2007 Nov-Dec;21(6):1231-6. doi: 10.1892/07-058.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combined incidence of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) reaches 10 to 12 new cases a year per million children under the age of 16 years, representing about 10% of all pediatric cancers. HD makes up to 40% and NHL 60% of pediatric lymphomas. During the last 20 years, cure rates raised dramatically so that currently over 90% of children and adolescents with HD and about 80% of those with NHL can be cured. As cure can be achieved in a large majority of patients, long-term effects and quality of life of the survivors are nowadays the principal challenges to pediatric oncologists. DISCUSSION: Like survivors from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, young adults cured from NHL may present with neurocognitive deficits, especially if treated at a young age and with cranial irradiation. Intrathecal or high-dose intravenous chemotherapy with methotrexate may induce the same problems, although in a lesser extent and severity. Large enough prospective cohort studies like the CCSS in the USA were able to show an increased risk of second malignant neoplasms, especially brain tumors in patients formerly treated with cranial irradiation. Reduced fertility can follow exposure to cyclophosphamide, especially in the male. Cardiac function must be serially evaluated over the long to very long-term because of potential cardiomyopathy after high anthracycline doses and/or mediastinal irradiation. Survivors from HD are at high risk of late complications. Radiation therapy to the neck and mediastinum (mantle field) induces a 50% risk of developing hypothyroidism and a 20% risk of developing thyroid nodules at 20 years. The risk of thyroid cancer is 18 times higher the expected rate for the general population. Secondary aggressive breast cancer shows a cumulative risk of 30% at 30 years after radiotherapy. Other structures affected by mediastinal irradiation are the heart (pericardial, myocardial and endocardial structures), the great arteries (fibrosis, stenosis, aneurysms) and the central portion of the lungs (diffusion troubles, restrictive pneumopathy). Cardiac toxicity can be enhanced by the concomitant therapy with adriamycin and lung toxicity by bleomycin. Radiotherapy to the paraaortic and iliacal lymph nodes can affect gonadal function both in males and females; concomitant chemotherapy with alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide and especially procarbazine have a synergistic action and can lead to premature menopause as well as infertility. Although the vast majority of survivors from pediatric lymphomas fare well, a minority present with extreme symptoms of depression and psychosomatic distress; female sex, low socio-economic status and treatment with intensive chemotherapy are important risk factors for a poor psychosocial outcome. CONCLUSION: It is therefore crucial, but not always easy, to inform patients and families about potential late effects and organize follow-up after the pediatric age. A well functioning network of pediatric oncologists, GP's, adult oncologists and other specialists of adult medicine must be developed in order to prevent, early detect and treat expected long-term toxicities.","['von der Weid, Nicolas X']",['von der Weid NX'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, 1011 Lausanne-CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland.

Vector insertion, resulting in transcriptional activation of proto-oncogenes, played a role in the development of lymphoid leukemia in an X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency trial, and caused myeloid clonal dominance in a trial for chronic granulomatous disease. These events have raised the question of whether gene therapy for other disorders such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease may hold a similar risk. In this study, we prospectively evaluated whether gamma-globin lentiviral vectors containing enhancer elements from the beta-globin locus control region could alter the expression of genes near the vector insertion. We studied this question in primary, clonal murine beta-thalassemic erythroid cells, where globin regulatory elements are highly active. We found an overall incidence of perturbed expression in 28% of the transduced clones, with 11% of all genes contained within a 600-kilobase region surrounding the vector-insertion site demonstrating altered expression. This rate was higher than that observed for a lentiviral vector containing a viral long-terminal repeat (LTR). This is the first direct evidence that lentiviral vectors can cause insertional dysregulation of cellular genes at a frequent rate.","['Hargrove, Phillip W', 'Kepes, Steven', 'Hanawa, Hideki', 'Obenauer, John C', 'Pei, Deiqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Gray, John T', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Persons, Derek A']","['Hargrove PW', 'Kepes S', 'Hanawa H', 'Obenauer JC', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Gray JT', 'Neale G', 'Persons DA']","[""Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080115,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'beta-Thalassemia/*blood/pathology']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31426-5 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300394 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Mar;16(3):525-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300394.

Reciprocal genomic breakpoint junctions and fusion transcripts joined MLL with FRYL, the Drosophila melanogaster protein homologue of which regulates cell fate. Etoposide metabolites induced topoisomerase II cleavage complexes that could form both breakpoint junctions. Cells harboring the translocation replaced the marrow without clinical evidence of leukemia and differentiation appeared unaffected for 37 months. Subsequent bilineage dysplasia and increased blasts in addition to the translocation fulfilled criteria for MDS. The MEIS1 target gene of typical MLL fusion oncoproteins was underexpressed before and at MDS diagnosis. These results are consistent with repair of topoisomerase II cleavage from etoposide metabolites as the translocation mechanism, whereas other agents in the regimen may have contributed to progression of the clone with the translocation to MDS. MLL-FRYL did not increase MEIS1 expression, conferred a proliferative advantage without altering differentiation, and had protracted latency to disease.","['Robinson, Blaine W', 'Cheung, Nai-Kong V', 'Kolaris, Christos P', 'Jhanwar, Suresh C', 'Choi, John K', 'Osheroff, Neil', 'Felix, Carolyn A']","['Robinson BW', 'Cheung NK', 'Kolaris CP', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Choi JK', 'Osheroff N', 'Felix CA']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/complications/diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43104-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-096065 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3802-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-096065.

Here, quantitative assays were used to analyze the alternative splicing of human c-myb transcripts. We identified an array of variant transcripts, expressed in highly regulated, lineage-specific patterns, that were formed through the use of alternate exons 8A, 9A, 9B, 10A, 13A, and 14A. Expression levels of the different splice variant transcripts were regulated independently of one another during human hematopoietic cell differentiation, and the alternative splicing of c-myb mRNAs was increased in primary leukemia samples. The alternatively spliced c-myb transcripts were associated with polysomes and encoded a series of c-Myb proteins with identical DNA binding domains but unique C-terminal domains. In several types of assays, the variant c-Myb proteins exhibited quantitative and qualitative differences in transcriptional activities and specificities. The results suggest that the human c-myb gene encodes a family of related proteins with different transcriptional activities. Enhanced alternative splicing may be a mechanism for unmasking the transforming activity of c-myb in human leukemias.","[""O'Rourke, John P"", 'Ness, Scott A']","[""O'Rourke JP"", 'Ness SA']","['Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, MSC08 4660, 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131-0001, USA. jorourkejr@salud.unm.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080114,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, myb', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01870-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01870-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Mar;28(6):2091-101. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01870-07.

ICSBP-deficient mice develop a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by cytokine hypersensitivity and apoptosis resistance. To identify ICSBP target genes involved in these effects, we screened a CpG island microarray with chromatin that co-immunoprecipitated with ICSBP from myeloid cells. Using this technique, we identified PTPN13 as an ICSBP target gene. PTPN13 encodes Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap-1), a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase. This was of interest because interaction of Fap-1 with Fas results in Fas dephosphorylation and inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis. In this study, we found that ICSBP influenced Fas-induced apoptosis in a Fap-1-dependent manner. We also found that ICSBP interacted with a cis element in the proximal PTPN13 promoter and repressed transcription. This interaction increased during myeloid differentiation and was regulated by phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the interferon regulatory factor domain of ICSBP. ICSBP deficiency was present in human myeloid malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia. Therefore, these studies identified a mechanism for increased survival of mature myeloid cells in the ICSBP-deficient murine model and in human myeloid malignancies with decreased ICSBP expression.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Zhu, Chunliu', 'Wang, Hao', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Zhu C', 'Wang H', 'Horvath E', 'Eklund EA']","['The Feinberg School of Medicine and The Robert H.

Very few reports have explored the clinicopathologic features and treatment outcome of HCL in Taiwan. METHODS: Of 33 patients with malignant lymphoma who underwent splenectomy over a 10-year period (1996-2005), 5 cases of HCL were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: All cases presented with various degrees of splenomegaly. Pancytopenia was noted in 3 cases, and lymphadenopathy in 1. Typical hairy cells with positive tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase stain were noted in 2 cases. Only 3 cases could be diagnosed with HCL based solely on bone marrow findings. In contrast, all spleen specimens had characteristic pathologic features. All patients underwent splenectomy uneventfully, and cladribine was given at a median time of 2 months after splenectomy without significant side effects. Complete remission with durable response was documented in 4 patients (80%) with a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 4-96 months). The last patient experienced partial remission but was only followed up for 4 months. CONCLUSION: For the HCL patients in this study, splenectomy had a role not only in improving cytopenia but in aiding diagnosis. Cladribine is safe and highly effective for Taiwanese patients and should be considered as first-line treatment for HCL.","['Yu, Yuan-Bin', 'Li, Chun-Yi', 'Chen, Chih-Cheng', 'You, Jie-Yu', 'Chau, Wing-Keung', 'Hsu, Hui-Chi', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng', 'Chen, Po-Ming', 'Ho, Chao-Hung']","['Yu YB', 'Li CY', 'Chen CC', 'You JY', 'Chau WK', 'Hsu HC', 'Gau JP', 'Chen PM', 'Ho CH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R O C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenectomy/*methods']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1726-4901(08)70059-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S1726-4901(08)70059-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2007 Dec;70(12):551-5. doi: 10.1016/S1726-4901(08)70059-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In turn, once deregulated as in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) fusion protein Bcr-Abl, PTKs can promote cancer onset and progression. The dramatic success of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib as therapy for CML has inspired interest in other PTKs as targets for cancer drug discovery. Here we report a novel PTK activity and inhibition screening method using hydrogel-immobilized peptide substrates. Using acrylate crosslinkers, we tether peptides via terminal cysteines to thiol-presenting hydrogels in 96-well plates. These surfaces display low background and high reproducibility, allowing semiquantitative detection of peptide phosphorylation by recombinant c-Abl or by Bcr-Abl activity in cell extracts using traditional anti-phosphotyrosine immunodetection and chemifluorescence. The capabilities of this assay are demonstrated by performing model screens for inhibition with several commercially available PTK inhibitors and a collection of pyridopyrimidine Src/Abl dual inhibitors. This assay provides a practical method to measure the activity of a single kinase present in a whole cell lysate with high sensitivity and specificity as a valuable means for efficient small molecule screening.","['Wu, Ding', 'Mand, Michael R', 'Veach, Darren R', 'Parker, Laurie L', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Kron, Stephen J']","['Wu D', 'Mand MR', 'Veach DR', 'Parker LL', 'Clarkson B', 'Kron SJ']","['Ludwig Center for Metastasis Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071225,United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '25852-47-5 (Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biological Assay/*methods', 'Cell Extracts', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/analysis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(07)00819-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2007.12.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2008 Apr 1;375(1):18-26. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2007.12.023.

The studies conducted have weaknesses that have generated a misclassification of such exposure. Occupations and exposures to substances associated with childhood cancer are not very frequently encountered in the general population; thus, the reported risks are both inconsistent and inaccurate. In this study, to assess exposure we used a new method, an exposure index, which took into consideration the industrial branch, specific position, use of protective equipment, substances at work, degree of contact with such substances, and time of exposure. This index allowed us to obtain a grade, which permitted the identification of individuals according to their level of exposure to known or potentially carcinogenic agents that are not necessarily specifically identified as risk factors for leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine the association between a father's occupational exposure to carcinogenic agents and the presence of AL in their offspring. METHODS: From 1999 to 2000, a case-control study was performed with 193 children who reside in Mexico City and had been diagnosed with AL. The initial sample-size calculation was 150 children per group, assessed with an expected odds ratio (OR) of three and a minimum exposure frequency of 15.8%. These children were matched by age, sex, and institution with 193 pediatric surgical patients at secondary-care hospitals. A questionnaire was used to determine each child's background and the characteristics of the father's occupation(s). In order to determine the level of exposure to carcinogenic agents, a previously validated exposure index (occupational exposure index, OEI) was used. The consistency and validity of the index were assessed by a questionnaire comparison, the sensory recognition of the work area, and an expert's opinion. RESULTS: The adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 1.69 (0.98, 2.92) during the preconception period; 1.98 (1.13, 3.45) during the index pregnancy; 2.11 (1.17, 3.78) during breastfeeding period; 2.17 (1.28, 3.66) after birth; and 2.06 (1.24, 3.42) for global exposure. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which an OEI was used to assess a father's occupational exposure to carcinogenic agents as a risk factor for the development of childhood AL in his offspring. From our results, we conclude that children whose fathers have been exposed to a high level of carcinogenic agents seem to have a greater risk of developing acute leukemia. However, confounding factors cannot be disregarded due to an incomplete control for confounding.","['Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Ortega-Alvarez, Manuel Carlos', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, Arturo', 'Bernaldez-Rios, Roberto', 'Del Campo-Martinez, Maria de Los Angeles', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Palomo-Colli, Miguel Angel', 'Paredes-Aguilera, Rogelio', 'Martinez-Avalos, Armando', 'Borja-Aburto, Victor Hugo', 'Rodriguez-Rivera, Maria de Jesus', 'Vargas-Garcia, Victor Manuel', 'Zarco-Contreras, Jesus', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel']","['Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Ortega-Alvarez MC', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Del Campo-Martinez Mde L', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Palomo-Colli MA', 'Paredes-Aguilera R', 'Martinez-Avalos A', 'Borja-Aburto VH', 'Rodriguez-Rivera Mde J', 'Vargas-Garcia VM', 'Zarco-Contreras J', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Mejia-Arangure JM']","['Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), DF, Mexico. maria_luisa_2000_mx@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080114,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)']",IM,"['Acute Disease/epidemiology', 'Adult', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Paternal Exposure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2007/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Jan 14;8:7. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-7.,,PMC2245964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joao, suffered extensive refurbishing intervention in order to adapt for autotransplant patients. Eight new individual rooms with central HEPA filtration system were built. All patients admitted in the department during 14 months prior to and 14 months after renovation works were enrolled. A total of 403 admissions were considered and a detailed analysis of all patients with fungal infections, air quality and antifungal consumption were evaluated in order to study clinical, environmental and economical impact after unit renovation. RESULTS: Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia submitted to induction treatment were the most susceptible to acquisition of fungal infections. Fungal infections were reduced after installation of HEPA filters in individual rooms, particularly proven and probable fungal infections. No patients were diagnosed with proven or probable mould infection in the period after the unit renovation and no deaths were registered among patients with the diagnosis of possible fungal infection. Considering the group of patients diagnosed with fungal infection, the average of hospitalization was reduced 3 d in the latter period. The new high-protected rooms showed a reduction of 50% and 95% of airborne fungi, respectively in the first week and after the second week. The consumption of voriconazole and caspofungin was reduced, respectively, 66% and 59% and the final cost with antifungal therapy was reduced by 17.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Autotransplant patients may be under higher risk of infection, however, the installation of high-protective measures may efficiently prevent fungal infections in these patients. Renovation of haematology unit resulted in major clinical, environmental and economical improvements.

As nilotinib might be used in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation where CD8+ T lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect, we investigated effects of nilotinib on this lymphocyte subpopulation. Nilotinib inhibits phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced proliferation of CD8+T lymphocytes in vitro at therapeutically relevant concentrations (0.5-4 microM). The inhibition of CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for leukaemia or viral antigens through nilotinib was associated with a reduced expansion of antigen peptide specific CD8+ T lymphocytes and with a decreased release of interferon-gamma and granzyme B by these cells as analysed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. The inhibitory effect caused by nilotinib was two times stronger than by imatinib. These effects were mediated through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of ZAP-70, Lck and ERK 1/2 and the NF-kappaB signalling transduction pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in (i) children with ALL diagnosed with asymptomatic DVT using radiographic testing and (ii) an unselected group of ALL survivors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in two populations. Group I comprised children in the Prophylactic Antithrombin Replacement in Kids with ALL treated with L-Asparaginase (PARKAA) study diagnosed with DVT by radiographic tests. Group II consisted of non-selected childhood ALL survivors <21 years. PTS was assessed using a standardized scoring sheet. RESULTS: Group I: 13 PARKAA patients (median age 12 years) were assessed, and 7 had PTS (54%; 95% CI, 25-81). All patients had collaterals, three also had increased arm circumference. Group II: 41 patients (median age 13 years) with a history of ALL were enrolled, and 10 had PTS (24%; 95% CI, 11-38). All patients had collaterals; five also had increased arm circumference. CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of PTS in survivors of childhood ALL with radiographically diagnosed asymptomatic DVT.

Some HES forms have a poor prognosis, either because of end-organ damage (particularly endomyocardial fibrosis), or because of associated myeloid leukemia or malignant T-cell lymphoma. Oral mucosa ulcerations can be early clinical signs in severe forms. They are discrete, round or oval, sometimes confluent ulcers or erosions, located on non-keratinized, unattached oral mucosa. In the last 15 years a better understanding of eosinophil biology has led to a new clinical classification of HES. The lymphocytic form is characterized by T-lymphocyte clonality, IL-5 production, and a possible progression to T-cell lymphoma. Oral lesions are more frequently associated with the myeloproliferative form, characterized by an increased risk of developing myeloid malignancies and a good response to a recent anti-tyrosine kinase therapy (imatinib mesylate). The target of imatinib is a novel kinase resulting from an 800-kb deletion on chromosome 4. Recently, the resulting FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene was characterized as a marker of response to imatinib. Exclusion of other erosive ulcerative oral disease and early recognition of HES in patients with oral ulcerations, and precise characterization of the lymphocytic or myeloproliferative form are therefore important to rapidly initiate an effective therapy.","['Ionescu, M A', 'Murata, H', 'Janin, A']","['Ionescu MA', 'Murata H', 'Janin A']","['Inserm U728, Universite Paris VII, Hopital Saint Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475, Paris Cedex 10, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080110,Denmark,Oral Dis,Oral diseases,9508565,,,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Oral Ulcer/*complications/pathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['ODI1393 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1601-0825.2007.01393.x [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Dis. 2008 Mar;14(2):115-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2007.01393.x.

We evaluated the complications of parvovirus B19 infection, including delays in the scheduled course of chemotherapy, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Consecutive bone marrow samples were collected from 117 children with ALL and were analyzed for parvovirus B19 DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the Nordic Childhood Leukemia Registry and from medical records. RESULTS: Among the 117 children with ALL, 18 (15%) were found to be parvovirus B19 DNA positive. The infection was suspected on clinical grounds in only 1 of these 18 patients. Patients with viremia at diagnosis or during therapy for infection had lower viral loads (median viral load, 7 x 10(4) copies/mL) than did those who became viremic during maintenance therapy (median viral load, 2 x 10(8) copies/mL). The former group also had fewer clinical complications. Indeed, when parvovirus B19 DNA was present during the maintenance treatment, the number of complications (including cytopenia) increased, causing significantly longer periods without chemotherapy (median duration without chemotherapy, 59 days vs. 30 days; P < or = .05) and a higher number of blood transfusions (P = .018) in parvovirus B19 DNA-positive patients than in parvovirus B19 DNA-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL who were infected with parvovirus B19 became cytopenic, leading to reduced treatment intensity and to complications during treatment. Screening for parvovirus B19 DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in pediatric patients with ALL and unexplained cytopenia is suggested.","['Lindblom, Anna', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Gustafsson, Igge', 'Norbeck, Oscar', 'Kaldensjo, Tove', 'Vernby, Asa', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Tolfvenstam, Thomas', 'Broliden, Kristina']","['Lindblom A', 'Heyman M', 'Gustafsson I', 'Norbeck O', 'Kaldensjo T', 'Vernby A', 'Henter JI', 'Tolfvenstam T', 'Broliden K']","['Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Solna, Center for Molecular Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pancytopenia/*virology', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*diagnosis/*pathology/virology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy']",2008/01/16 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2008/01/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1086/526522 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Feb 15;46(4):528-36. doi: 10.1086/526522.,,,,,['Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Feb 15;46(4):537-9.

Meanwhile, the electrochemical detection and the microculture tetrazolium studies were also explored to probe the effect of the relevant nanomaterials on the drug uptake of cancer cells. The results illustrate that the nanocomposites could effectively facilitate the interaction of daunorubicin with leukemia cells and remarkably enhance the permeation and drug uptake of anticancer agents in the cancer cells, which could readily lead to the induction of the cell death of leukemia cells.

They have been employed to treat almost every known disease, from urticaria to leukemia. GCs are so termed because of their action to increase plasma glucose as a result of enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis, but they play, also, key regulatory roles in a wide variety of physiologic processes. They are essential for survival under stress. GC effect is mediated through receptors localised in cytosol. Receptor-GC complexes bind to hormone response elements in nuclear DNA, affect transcription of genes, either stimulating or inhibiting mRNAs. Proteins so produced (enzymes, hormones) are responsible for the steroid response. There is one type of GC receptor and all GCs will affect all tissues in the same way. At present rational use of GCs falls into two categories: replacement therapy (in Addison's diseasse and in congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and pharmacotherapy, mostly for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, but also to lyse leukemic lymphocytes or to reduce brain edema. GC therapy does not cure the primary disease--it only ameliorates its manifestations and provides time for the body natural defenses to work. After the withdrawal of steroid therapy manifestations of primary process usually return. So, as a result, there is no positive effect on long-term prognosis. Most common indications for prologned high-dose GC therapy are in organ transplantation, tumour chemotherapy, collagen vascular syndromes, ulcerative colitis, nephrotic syndrome and regional enteritis. Asthma, allergic diseases, inflammatory eye diseases and blood dyscrasias are also often treated with GCs. Used in pharmacological doses GCs have a number of adverse side effects. The use of alternate 0 day therapy can decrease most GC side effects (less suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, growth inhibition, cushingoid features, infections and myopathy). Discontinuation of long-term therapy is potentially difficult (""steroid withdrawal syndrome""). It is necessary to reduce the total dose gradually, in small weekly decrements. Recent use of GCs in prenatal treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is described.","['Radmanovic, S Z']",['Radmanovic SZ'],,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Child', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans']",1995/06/01 00:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 1995 Jun;123 Suppl 1:58-62.,,,,,,Glukokortikoidni lekovu u pedijatriji.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to quantify and characterize the circulating endothelial cells (CECs) in patients with B-CLL and correlate with plasma angiogenesis-related factors. Using a four-color flow cytometry, we prospectively analyzed the CEC in the whole blood of 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with B-CLL. We quantified (CD45-/CD31+/CD146+) and characterized the CECs according to whether they were apoptotic (annexin stain) or activated (CD106+). We also measured plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). Most patients (90%) had Rai stages 0-2 at the time of diagnosis. As a group, B-CLL patients had higher number of CECs (median of 26.5 cells/ml) compared (P = 0.04) to healthy controls (18.5 cells/ml). However, only four (20%) patients had elevated CEC counts, defined as >/=2 SD of the control mean (>/=53 cells/ml). The proportions of apoptotic (P = 0.83) and activated (P = 0.12) CECs were similar in both groups. B-CLL patients had higher FGF-2 (P < 0.001), lower TSP-1 (P = 0.004), and similar VEGF (P = 0.27) plasma levels. The number of CECs was not associated with Rai stage, absolute lymphocyte count, or levels of angiogenesis-related factors. CECs are increased in only a small fraction of B-CLL patients in our cohort with low rates of apoptosis and activation.

We studied the TPMT phenotype in three major Asian ethnic groups in Singapore, namely the Chinese (Ch), Malays (Mal) and Indians (Ind), with the aim of carrying out a comprehensive survey of the distribution of TPMT activity in Asians. METHODS: A radiochemical assay was used to measure the enzymatic activity of TPMT in the red blood cells (RBCs) of 479 healthy adults (Ch=153, Mal=163 and Ind=163). Cut-off points for intermediate TPMT activity were validated using a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. PCR-based methods were used to screen for the TPMT*3C, TPMT*3A and TPMT*6 variants. RESULTS: The histogram of the combined population cohort showed a bimodal distribution of TPMT activity, with no subject having low TPMT activity (<5 units). In total, TPMT variants were detected in 14 subjects (*1/*3C in 13 subjects; *1/*3A in one subject). We observed significant inter-ethnic differences in terms of TPMT activity (p<0.001), with the Malays showing a higher median activity than the Chinese or Indians (17.8 units vs 16.4 units). The Malays also showed a higher methylation rate--with a cut-off point for intermediate TPMT activity of 11.3 units--than the Chinese (9.9 units) or Indians (9.4 units). A high phenotype-genotype correlation of >97% was observed in all three races. We also genotyped 418 childhood leukaemias. The combined analysis of subjects participating in this and a previous study--1585 subjects--showed that 4.7% of Chinese (n=30/644), 4.4% of Malays (n=24/540) and 2.7% of Indians (n=11/401) were heterozygous at the TPMT gene locus. CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive TPMT phenotype and genotype study in Asian populations, particularly in the Malays and Indians.","['Kham, Shirley Kow Yin', 'Soh, Chin Kok', 'Liu, Te Chih', 'Chan, Yiong Huak', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Tan, Poh Lin', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng Juh']","['Kham SK', 'Soh CK', 'Liu TC', 'Chan YH', 'Ariffin H', 'Tan PL', 'Yeoh AE']","['Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, and Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Hospital, Singapore City, Republic of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080111,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00228-007-0426-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Apr;64(4):373-9. doi: 10.1007/s00228-007-0426-x.

PU.1 functions as oncogene in Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia and as tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemias. Moreover, Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia requires maintenance of PU.1 expression and the disruption of p53 function greatly accelerates disease progression. It has been hypothesized that p53-mediated expression of the p21(Cip1) cell cycle inhibitor during differentiation of pre-erythroleukemia cells promotes selection against p53 function. In addition to the blockage of erythroblast differentiation provided by increased levels of PU.1, we propose that PU.1 alters p53 function. We demonstrate that PU.1 reduces the transcriptional activity of the p53 tumor suppressor family and thus inhibits activation of genes important for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Inhibition is mediated through binding of PU.1 to the DNA-binding and/or oligomerization domains of p53/p73 proteins. Lastly, knocking down endogenous PU.1 in p53 wild-type REH B-cell precursor leukemia cells leads to increased expression of the p53 target p21(Cip1).","['Tschan, M P', 'Reddy, V A', 'Ress, A', 'Arvidsson, G', 'Fey, M F', 'Torbett, B E']","['Tschan MP', 'Reddy VA', 'Ress A', 'Arvidsson G', 'Fey MF', 'Torbett BE']","['Experimental Oncology/Hematology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080114,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211004 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211004 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 May 29;27(24):3489-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211004.

To explore this process, we employed retroviral insertional mutagenesis to CML-exhibiting p210BCR/ABL transgenic mice (Tg). Virus infection induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in p210BCR/ABL Tg with a higher frequency and in a shorter latency than wild-type littermates, and inverse PCR detected two retrovirus common integration sites (CISs) in p210BCR/ABL Tg tumors. Interestingly, one CIS was the transgene itself, where retrovirus integrations induced upregulation of p210BCR/ABL and production of truncated BCR/ABL with an enhanced kinase activity. Another CIS was Notch1 gene, where retrovirus integrations resulted in overexpression of Notch1 and generation of Notch1 lacking the C-terminal region (Notch1DeltaC) associated with stable expression of its activated product, C-terminal-truncated Notch intracellular domain (NICD Delta C). In addition, generation of Tg for both p210BCR/ABL and Notch1DeltaC developed ALL in a shortened period with Stat5 activation, demonstrating the cooperative oncogenicity of Notch1DeltaC/NICD Delta C with p210BCR/ABL involving Stat5-mediated pathway. These results demonstrated that overexpression/enhanced kinase activity of BCR/ABL and altered expression of Notch1 induces acute leukemia in a transgenic model for CML.","['Mizuno, T', 'Yamasaki, N', 'Miyazaki, K', 'Tazaki, T', 'Koller, R', 'Oda, H', 'Honda, Z-i', 'Ochi, M', 'Wolff, L', 'Honda, H']","['Mizuno T', 'Yamasaki N', 'Miyazaki K', 'Tazaki T', 'Koller R', 'Oda H', 'Honda ZI', 'Ochi M', 'Wolff L', 'Honda H']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080114,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/pathogenicity', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Virus Integration/*physiology']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211007 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211007 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 May 29;27(24):3465-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211007.

In contrast to what has been observed with other cell types, TGFbeta activation did not promote Bim upregulation in BL41 cells, but instead resulted in Bim release from the mitochondria. Indeed, Bim levels were high in healthy BL41 cells, in which they dimerized with the Bcl-2-like protein Mcl-1 at the mitochondrial surface. In healthy and TGFbeta-activated BL41 cells, unlike in epithelial cells or hepatocytes, Bim did not associate with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. TGFbeta activation of BL41 cells triggered the p38-dependent activation of caspase-8, causing the cleavage of Mcl-1 and the transfer of Bim from the mitochondria to the cytoskeleton.

The status of mixed chimerism in allotransplanted rats provided an opportunity for immunotherapy using alloreactive donor cells. In addition to T or natural killer (NK) cells, we introduced a second infusion of bone marrow cells as prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to test whether an effective graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response could be obtained without clinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). METHODS: BN rats were sublethally irradiated and transplanted with T-cell depleted bone marrow cells from either fully major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched (PVG) donor rats or MHC-matched (PVG.1N) as controls. Seven days after transplantation, rats were given 500 leukemic cells to mimic minimal residual disease. Additional cellular therapy was given at day +7. The efficiency of DLI was monitored by chimerism analysis in peripheral blood. RESULTS: Rats receiving infusions of NK cells succumbed to leukemia. T-DLI induced complete donor T-cell chimerism and lethal GVHD. A second alloBMT protected against leukemia. This effect was dependent on an MHC incompatibility between the donor and host and also on the presence of alloreactive T cells in the second bone marrow inoculum, resulting in an increased, mixed donor T-cell chimerism. CONCLUSION: A second prophylactic transplantation influenced the degree of T-cell chimerism to balance favorably between GVL and GVHD. If applicable to humans, repeated alloBMT may provide a novel approach to leukemia therapy.","['Nestvold, Janne M', 'Omdal, Bente K', 'Dai, Ke-Zheng', 'Martens, Anton', 'Benestad, Haakon B', 'Vaage, John T', 'Rolstad, Bent']","['Nestvold JM', 'Omdal BK', 'Dai KZ', 'Martens A', 'Benestad HB', 'Vaage JT', 'Rolstad B']","['Department of Anatomy, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, and Institute of Immunology, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical Center, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/*methods/pathology', 'Chimerism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Rats, Nude', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/physiology']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000296856.53493.1f [doi]', '00007890-200801150-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2008 Jan 15;85(1):102-11. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000296856.53493.1f.,,,,,['Transplantation. 2008 Jan 15;85(1):7-8.

The active marrow, the tissue of concern in leukaemia induction, is present within the spongiosa regions of trabecular bone, whereas the osteoprogenitor cells at risk for bone cancer induction are considered to be within the soft tissues adjacent to the mineral surfaces. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends averaging the absorbed energy over the active marrow within the spongiosa and over the soft tissues within 10 microm of the mineral surface for leukaemia and bone cancer induction, respectively. In its forthcoming recommendation, it is expected that the latter guidance will be changed to include soft tissues within 50 microm of the mineral surfaces. To address the computational problems, the skeleton of the proposed ICRP reference computational phantom has been subdivided to identify those voxels associated with cortical shell, spongiosa and the medullary cavity of the long bones. It is further proposed that the Monte Carlo calculations with these phantoms compute the energy deposition in the skeletal target tissues as the product of the particle fluence in the skeletal subdivisions and applicable fluence-to-dose-response functions. This paper outlines the development of such response functions for photons.","['Eckerman, K F', 'Bolch, W E', 'Zankl, M', 'Petoussi-Henss, N']","['Eckerman KF', 'Bolch WE', 'Zankl M', 'Petoussi-Henss N']","['Life Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6480, USA. eckermankf@ornl.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080111,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['Biological Assay/methods', 'Bone and Bones/*physiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Energy Transfer/physiology', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Photons', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Species Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Whole-Body Counting/*methods']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncm468 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncm468 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2007;127(1-4):187-91. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncm468.

Previous work using other cell types showed that flavopiridol impacts mitochondria, and in CLL cells flavopiridol down-regulates the mitochondrial protein Mcl-1. We therefore investigated mitochondrial structure and function in flavopiridol-treated CLL patient cells and in the lymphoblastic cell line 697 using concentrations and times at which tumor lysis is observed in treated patients. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was detected in flavopiridol-treated CLL cells by 6 hours, well before the onset of cell death. Flavopiridol-induced mitochondrial depolarization was not blocked by caspase inhibitors or by the calcium chelator EGTA, but was reduced by Bcl-2 overexpression. Intracellular calcium mobilization was noted at early time points using fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry showed a gradual but significant reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rate by 6 hours, corresponding with ultrastructural mitochondrial damage detected by electron microscopy. These observations suggest that in CLL and 697 cells, flavopiridol mediates its cytotoxic effects via induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and changes in intracellular calcium.","['Hussain, Syed-Rehan A', 'Lucas, David M', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Bakaletz, Alan P', 'Dang, Vinh X', 'Viatchenko-Karpinski, Serge', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kuppusamy, Periannan', 'Crouser, Elliott D', 'Grever, Michael R']","['Hussain SR', 'Lucas DM', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lin TS', 'Bakaletz AP', 'Dang VX', 'Viatchenko-Karpinski S', 'Ruppert AS', 'Byrd JC', 'Kuppusamy P', 'Crouser ED', 'Grever MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080111,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48630-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-115733 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 15;111(6):3190-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-115733.

FLT3 mutations trigger downstream signaling pathways including RAS-MAP/AKT kinases and signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5). We find that FLT3/ITD mutations start a cycle of genomic instability whereby increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production leads to increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and repair errors that may explain aggressive AML in FLT3/ITD patients. Cell lines transfected with FLT3/ITD and FLT3/ITD-positive AML cell lines and primary cells demonstrate increased ROS. Increased ROS levels appear to be produced via STAT5 signaling and activation of RAC1, an essential component of ROS-producing NADPH oxidases. A direct association of RAC1-GTP binding to phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) provides a possible mechanism for ROS generation. A FLT3 inhibitor blocked increased ROS in FLT3/ITD cells resulting in decreased DSB and increased repair efficiency and fidelity. Our study suggests that the aggressiveness of the disease and poor prognosis of AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutations could be the result of increased genomic instability that is driven by higher endogenous ROS, increased DNA damage, and decreased end-joining fidelity.","['Sallmyr, Annahita', 'Fan, Jinshui', 'Datta, Kamal', 'Kim, Kyu-Tae', 'Grosu, Dan', 'Shapiro, Paul', 'Small, Donald', 'Rassool, Feyruz']","['Sallmyr A', 'Fan J', 'Datta K', 'Kim KT', 'Grosu D', 'Shapiro P', 'Small D', 'Rassool F']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080111,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Base Pair Mismatch/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48628-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-092510 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 15;111(6):3173-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-092510.

Analysis of molecular basis of MDS has been hampered by the heterogeneity of the disease. Recently, mutations of the transcription factor AML1/RUNX1 have been identified in 15% to 40% of MDS-refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and MDS/AML. We performed mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using bone marrow cells transduced with the AML1 mutants. Most mice developed MDS and MDS/AML-like symptoms within 4 to 13 months after BMT. Interestingly, among integration sites identified, Evi1 seemed to collaborate with an AML1 mutant harboring a point mutation in the Runt homology domain (D171N) to induce MDS/AML with an identical phenotype characterized by marked hepatosplenomegaly, myeloid dysplasia, leukocytosis, and biphenotypic surface markers. Collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 was confirmed by a BMT model where coexpression of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced acute leukemia of the same phenotype with much shorter latencies. On the other hand, a C-terminal truncated AML1 mutant (S291fsX300) induced pancytopenia with erythroid dysplasia in transplanted mice, followed by progression to MDS-RAEB or MDS/AML. Thus, we have developed a useful mouse model of MDS/AML that should help in the understanding of the molecular basis of MDS and the progression of MDS to overt leukemia.","['Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Kitaura, Jiro', 'Ono, Ryoichi', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Kitaura J', 'Ono R', 'Harada H', 'Harada Y', 'Komeno Y', 'Nakajima H', 'Nosaka T', 'Inaba T', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080111,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Erythroid Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukocytosis/pathology', 'Leukopenia/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Pancytopenia/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)40893-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-01-068346 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 15;111(8):4297-308. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-068346.

Human patients with dominant-negative mutations in the Stat3 gene develop recurrent pneumonias, suggesting a role for STAT3 in pulmonary host defense. We hypothesized that alveolar epithelial STAT3 is activated by IL-6 family cytokines and is required for effective responses during gram-negative bacterial pneumonia. STAT3 phosphorylation was increased in pneumonic mouse lungs and in murine lung epithelial (MLE)-15 cells stimulated with pneumonic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) through 48 hours of Escherichia coli pneumonia. Mice lacking active STAT3 in alveolar epithelial cells (Stat3(Delta/Delta)) had fewer alveolar neutrophils and more viable bacteria than control mice early after intratracheal E. coli. By 48 hours after E. coli infection, however, lung injury was increased in Stat3(Delta/Delta) mice. Bacteria were cleared from lungs of both genotypes, albeit more slowly in Stat3(Delta/Delta) mice. Of the IL-6 family cytokines measured in lungs from infected C57BL/6 mice, IL-6, oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-11 were significantly elevated. Neutralization studies demonstrated that LIF and IL-6 mediated BALF-induced STAT3 activation in MLE-15 cells. Together, these results indicate that during E. coli pneumonia, select IL-6 family members activate alveolar epithelial STAT3, which functions to promote neutrophil recruitment and to limit both infection and lung injury.","['Quinton, Lee J', 'Jones, Matthew R', 'Robson, Bryanne E', 'Simms, Benjamin T', 'Whitsett, Jeffrey A', 'Mizgerd, Joseph P']","['Quinton LJ', 'Jones MR', 'Robson BE', 'Simms BT', 'Whitsett JA', 'Mizgerd JP']","['Molecular and Integrative Physiological Sciences Program, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080110,United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines/genetics/immunology', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*immunology', '*Lung/cytology/immunology/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*immunology', '*Pulmonary Alveoli/cytology/immunology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/immunology']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0365OC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2007-0365OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2008 Jun;38(6):699-706. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2007-0365OC.

The key molecular mechanism for this gene transcription regulation in injured neurons is poorly understood. Among many nerve injury-inducible genes, the gene encoding damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) showed most marked expression response to various kinds of nerve injuries in central and peripheral nervous system neurons. This unique feature led us to examine the promoter region of the DINE gene and clarify both the injury-responsive element within the promoter and its related transcriptional machinery. This study showed that DINE promoter was activated by leukemia inhibitory factor and nerve growth factor withdrawal, which were pivotal for the up-regulation of DINE mRNA after nerve injury. The injury-inducible transcription factors such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), c-Jun, and STAT3, which were located at the downstream of leukemia inhibitory factor and nerve growth factor withdrawal, seemed to be involved in the activation of the DINE promoter. Surprisingly, these transcription factors did not bind to the DINE promoter directly. Instead, the general transcription factor, Sp1, bound to a GC box within the promoter. ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3 interacted with Sp1 and are associated with the GC box region of the DINE gene in injured neurons. These findings suggested that Sp1 recruit ATF3, c-Jun, and STAT3 to obtain the requisite synergistic effect. Of these transcription factors, ATF3 may be the most critical, because ATF3 is specifically expressed after nerve injury.","['Kiryu-Seo, Sumiko', 'Kato, Ryuichi', 'Ogawa, Tokiko', 'Nakagomi, Saya', 'Nagata, Kenichi', 'Kiyama, Hiroshi']","['Kiryu-Seo S', 'Kato R', 'Ogawa T', 'Nakagomi S', 'Nagata K', 'Kiyama H']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Osaka City University, Graduate School of Medicine, 1-4-3 Asahimachi, Abeno-ku, Osaka 545-8585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080111,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATF3 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Atf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Atf3 protein, rat)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurons/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)57137-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M707514200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Mar 14;283(11):6988-96. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M707514200.

We demonstrate that Wnt signaling can initiate TE lineage differentiation by triggering an appropriate cue, caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2). Overexpression and RNA interference knockdown studies indicate that Cdx2 induction in response to Wnt3a is mediated by lymphoid enhancer factor 1, whose expression is regulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein. Removal of LIF, along with addition of Wnt3a, stimulated Cdx2 expression and induced formation of trophoblast stem (TS) cells. These TS cells were able to differentiate into cells with characteristics of spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence that TE lineage differentiation can be induced by Wnt signaling in mouse ES cells.","['He, Shuyang', 'Pant, Disha', 'Schiffmacher, Andrew', 'Meece, Ashley', 'Keefer, Carol L']","['He S', 'Pant D', 'Schiffmacher A', 'Meece A', 'Keefer CL']","['Department of Animal and Avian Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080110,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Cdx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lef1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (Wnt3a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt3A Protein']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/08/16 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0356 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2007-0356 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 Apr;26(4):842-9. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2007-0356.

DESIGN: Mailed survey. SETTING: Cases from a comprehensive cancer center. SAMPLE: Convenience sample of 144 childhood cancer survivors aged 13-35 years identified through previous research. Surveys were returned by 118 participants (82% response rate). METHODS: Descriptive statistics with chi-square tests were performed between subgroups defined by age (< 18 years and < or = 18 years) and diagnosis (leukemia, lymphoma, and central nervous system cancers). MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Barriers to exercise, consuming less fat, and eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods. FINDINGS: Proportionately more childhood cancer survivors reported barriers to exercise and following a low-fat diet than to consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods. Primary barriers to exercise included being too tired (57%), being too busy (53%), and not belonging to a gym (48%), whereas barriers for restricting high-fat foods were commercials that make high-fat foods look so appealing (58%) and having friends who eat a lot of high-fat foods (50%). Difficulty associated with ordering healthy foods when dining out also was a leading barrier to following a low-fat diet (50%), as well as eating more whole grains (31%), fruits and vegetables (30%), and calcium-rich foods (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors report several barriers to exercise and consuming a low-fat diet with more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: This study's findings may be helpful to nurses, health educators, and allied health professionals in developing effective interventions that promote healthful lifestyle change among childhood cancer survivors.","['Arroyave, Whitney D', 'Clipp, Elizabeth C', 'Miller, Paige E', 'Jones, Lee W', 'Ward, Dianne S', 'Bonner, Melanie J', 'Rosoff, Philip M', 'Snyder, Denise Clutter', 'Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy']","['Arroyave WD', 'Clipp EC', 'Miller PE', 'Jones LW', 'Ward DS', 'Bonner MJ', 'Rosoff PM', 'Snyder DC', 'Demark-Wahnefried W']","['School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. whitney.arroyave@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', '*Exercise', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Survivors/psychology', 'United States']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['QU43V8136251X072 [pii]', '10.1188/08.ONF.121-130 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2008 Jan;35(1):121-30. doi: 10.1188/08.ONF.121-130.,,,['P20 NR007795/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developing from Kostmann syndrome has not been standardized. We treated this patient with allo-PBSCT using a regimen combining high-dose cytosine arabinoside with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, in addition to total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide without preceding intensive chemotherapy. The donor was ABO incompatible. Myeloid and platelet recoveries were achieved rapidly. Erythroid engraftment was not evident, however, and the patient was given a diagnosis of PRCA. Regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were limited. The PRCA did not respond to various therapies, including the discontinuation of immunosuppressants for the induction of chronic GVHD, human recombinant erythropoietin, immunosuppressive treatment with steroids, cyclosporin A, and human anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab). The patient received transfusions 48 times until the resolution of his anemia by donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) at 25 months after PBSCT. He is now clinically well (performance status, 100%) with normal blood cell counts at 5 years after SCT. An in vitro study demonstrated that serum from the recipient blocked the differentiation of erythroid cells in the bone marrow.

Previous studies suggested that FLT3/ITD mutation indicates a poor prognosis and that NPM1 mutation indicates a more favorable one, but these studies were often performed with selected patient populations. We investigated the clinical significance of these mutations at our institution with an unselected group of patients with newly diagnosed AML. This group included patients > or =60 years old and those with a poor performance status. Using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we detected FLT3/ITD mutations in 12 patients (20.0%) and NPM1 mutations in 7 patients (11.7%) among a group of 60 patients.

We report the successful use of tranexamic acid (TA) combined with unfractionated heparin in a patient with life-threatening bleeding from the sigmoid colon caused by DIC. A 35-year-old man who had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia was referred for relapse of his leukemia. The patient was first treated with imatinib at 600 mg/day. Although the disappearance of leukemic cells and a decrease in the BCR/ABL fusion gene were observed, he developed massive bleeding from the sigmoid colon after defecation. A laboratory diagnosis of DIC with prominent fibrinolysis was based on elevated levels of both plasmin-alpha2-plasmin inhibitor complex and thrombin-antithrombin III complex. Despite vigorous supportive therapy, including multiple transfusions and aggressive fluid resuscitation, the patient developed hypovolemic shock due to the uncontrollable bleeding. TA combined with unfractionated heparin was instituted to inhibit excessive fibrinolysis. A prompt response was observed soon after the commencement of therapy. No organ dysfunction was observed throughout TA and heparin use. To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe successful treatment with TA combined with heparin for life-threatening intestinal bleeding due to acute DIC associated with hematologic malignancy.","['Koseki, Mihoko', 'Asada, Noboru', 'Uryu, Hidetaka', 'Takeuchi, Masami', 'Asakura, Hidesaku', 'Matsue, Kosei']","['Koseki M', 'Asada N', 'Uryu H', 'Takeuchi M', 'Asakura H', 'Matsue K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kameda General Hospital, Higashi-Chou, Kamogawa-shi, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '0 (antithrombin III-protease complex)', '0 (plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex)', '6T84R30KC1 (Tranexamic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colon/pathology', 'Colonic Diseases/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Fibrinolysin/analysis', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/blood/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Genes, abl', 'Heparin/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Peptide Hydrolases/analysis', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Shock/blood/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Tranexamic Acid/*administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/analysis']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/03/13 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['07666U5451547520 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02983996 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Dec;86(5):403-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02983996.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A prospective randomised multicenter study was made on 32 neutropenic hematological patients receiving conventional AmB for empirical antifungal treatment. The patients were randomised after a greater than or equal to 30% increase of serum creatinine (sCr). Patients in the early-switch group received liposomal AmB just after randomisation and patients in the late-switch group received liposomal AmB only when serum creatinine increase was greater or equal to 100% or sCr reached 170mumol/L. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were analysed: 16 patients in the early-switch group and 15 patients in the late-switch group (seven switched to liposomal AmB and eight continued conventional AmB treatment). The mean age of patients was 48 years and 68% were men. The most frequent underlying haematological malignancy was acute leukemia (94%). In the late-switch group, the degradation of renal function continued after randomisation contrary to the early-switch group: median variations of calculated sCr clearance in early- and late-switch groups were -16.8 and -1.5%, respectively (P=0.03). Moreover, an early switch was cost-effective with a sCr lower duration of hospitalisation in comparison with a late switch. CONCLUSIONS: This randomised trial suggests that an early switch to Liposomal AmB improves and preserves renal function in comparison with a late switch.","['Isnard, F', 'Tilleul, P', 'Laporte, J-P', 'Chevallier, P', 'Pigneux, A', 'Lafuma, A', 'Monchecourt, F', 'Mahi, L', 'Deray, G']","['Isnard F', 'Tilleul P', 'Laporte JP', 'Chevallier P', 'Pigneux A', 'Lafuma A', 'Monchecourt F', 'Mahi L', 'Deray G']","['Service hematologie, hopital St-Antoine, 184, rue du Faubourg-St-Antoine, 75571 Paris cedex 12, France. francoise.isnard@sat.aphp.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20080110,France,Med Mal Infect,Medecine et maladies infectieuses,0311416,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*drug effects/physiopathology', '*Kidney Function Tests', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/prevention & control']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2007/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0399-077X(07)00401-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medmal.2007.11.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mal Infect. 2008 Apr;38(4):208-14. doi: 10.1016/j.medmal.2007.11.016.

The paucity of randomized studies determining the efficacy and tolerability of these new regimens, however, has made therapy selection for individual patients complex and cumbersome. At the present time, it remains unclear whether patients with aggressive disease based on molecular features should receive early or alternative treatment strategies. In this review, we summarize the data on combination chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in CLL and propose several key factors that should be taken into consideration when deciding on an initial treatment strategy. The review is intended to discuss and simplify first-line therapy selection for patients with CLL in the era of new prognostic indicators and the better understanding of disease biology.","['Nabhan, Chadi', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Nabhan C', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE']","['Oncology Specialists, S.

Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemia cells are highly resistant to apoptosis. Imatinib an Abl kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective agent for patients with CML. However, a small percentage of these patients and most advanced-phase patients relapse on imatinib therapy. It is poorly understood whether the Abl kinase inhibitors are able to eradicate CML progenitor or stem cells. In this study, we investigated the role of HOXA10 in CML cell lines and the hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from CML patients, and whether the regulation of HOXA10 eradicates Bcr-Abl(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The Abl kinase inhibitors and PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, induced the expression of HOXA10, and it enhanced apoptosis in CML cells. Moreover, the reduction of HOXA10 expression by siRNA in CML cells inhibited apoptosis by treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitors and LY294002. These results revealed that HOXA10 had an important role in induction of apoptosis by the Abl kinase inhibitors in CML cells. Finally, we showed that the inhibition of HOXA10 expression by siRNA increased the numbers of CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM when the cells were treated with the combination of BMS354825 and LY294002 compared to control cells, and HOXA10 played a critical role in the committed colony-formation in CML. This study shows for the first time that the Abl kinase inhibitor and LY294002 induced HOXA10, and HOXA10 had an important role in apoptosis or cell growth inhibition in CML cells in vitro.","['Sugimoto, Yuya', 'Nakamura, Satoki', 'Okinaka, Keiji', 'Hirano, Isao', 'Ono, Takaaki', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Shinjo, Kaori', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Sugimoto Y', 'Nakamura S', 'Okinaka K', 'Hirano I', 'Ono T', 'Shigeno K', 'Shinjo K', 'Ohnishi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu city, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080110,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2007/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00474-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jun;32(6):962-71. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.034.

We conducted a nonrandomized controlled clinical study to investigate the role of continuous bladder irrigation in addition to mesna, hydration, and alkalization in the prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. A total of 80 eligible patients entered the study. From May 2006, 40 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation received continuous bladder irrigation in addition to the common protocol. A historical control group of 40 consecutive patients with same inclusion criteria who did not receive bladder irrigation was enrolled from before May 2006. Hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in 50% of patients in the no bladder irrigation group versus 32% in bladder irrigation group (P = 0.11). The mean duration of hemorrhagic cystitis was significantly reduced in the bladder irrigation group (10 vs. 18 days; P = 0.02). Duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the bladder irrigation group (30.2 vs. 39.6; P < 0.001). Late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis that occurred beyond 4 weeks after allo-hemorrhagic cystitis happened more significantly in the no bladder irrigation group (P = 0.001). High-grade hemorrhagic cystitis was more frequently associated with high-grade graft-versus-host disease within 30 days after transplant (P = 0.06). In general, continuous bladder irrigation added to mesna, hydration, and alkalization regimens was well tolerated, decreased the complications of hemorrhagic cystitis, and may be useful in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients.

Higher levels of sCD138 correlate with poor outcome in myeloma. We examined the association of circulating sCD138 levels in plasma with clinical behavior in 104 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. sCD138 levels were significantly higher in patients (median, 52.8 ng/ml; range, 13.4-252.7 ng/ml) than in healthy control subjects (median, 19.86; range, 14.49-33.14 ng/ml) (P < 0.01). Elevated sCD138 (>median, 52.8 ng/ml) was associated with significantly shorter survival (P = 0.0004); this association was independent of IgVH mutation status, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M) level, and treatment history. Patients with mutated IgVH but high sCD138 levels (>52.8 ng/ml) had significantly shorter survival than those with mutated IgVH and lower levels of sCD138. Similarly, patients with unmutated IgVH but high sCD138 levels had significantly shorter survival than those with lower sCD138 levels and unmutated IgVH (P = 0.007). In a multivariate Cox regression model, only Rai stage, beta2-M, and sCD138 remained predictors of survival. These data suggest that sCD138 when combined with beta2-M and Rai stage, may replace the need for testing IgVH mutation status.","['Jilani, I', 'Wei, C', 'Bekele, B N', 'Zhang, Z J', 'Keating, M', 'Wierda, W', 'Ferrajoli, A', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S M"", 'Giles, F J', 'Albitar, M']","['Jilani I', 'Wei C', 'Bekele BN', 'Zhang ZJ', 'Keating M', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Estrov Z', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Giles FJ', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080107,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Syndecan-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Solubility', 'Syndecan-1/*blood/*genetics']",2008/01/15 09:00,2009/03/14 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH1010 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01010.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Feb;31(1):97-105. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01010.x.

OBJECTIVE: We reviewed 21 biopsy-proven cases of LC with emphasis on the use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and histologic features were reviewed on 21 cases of biopsy proven LC. Immunohistochemical stains for CD4, CD34, CD56, CD68, CD117, CD123, TdT, lysozyme and myeloperoxidase were performed on 12 with available tissue blocks. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 24 to 88 years (mean = 57), with 12 men: 9 women. Primary hematologic diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia (n = 14), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 3), essential thrombocythemia (n = 1) and myeloid leukemia, NOS (n = 3). Monocytic myeloid LC was most common (35%). There was 100% positivity with CD68 and lysozyme. Myeloperoxidase, CD117 and CD34 immunostains were less sensitive in myeloid LC (58%, 33% and 17%, respectively). CD4 was positive in 67%. CD56 was positive in 33%. CONCLUSION: Myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation more commonly involves the skin than other types of myeloid leukemia. CD68 and lysozyme immunostains, although not lineage specific for monocytes/macrophages, are the most sensitive immunostains in the detection of myeloid LC. Myeloperoxidase immunostains are useful, but immunostains for CD117 and CD34 are insufficiently sensitive. CD4 expression is common, but CD56 expression is not.","['Cibull, Thomas L', 'Thomas, Antoinette B', ""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'Billings, Steven D']","['Cibull TL', 'Thomas AB', ""O'Malley DP"", 'Billings SD']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['CUP784 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0560.2007.00784.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2008 Feb;35(2):180-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2007.00784.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these studies were performed during outbreaks of CDAD. Colonization pressure and use of fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, and gastric acid suppressors have not been fully evaluated as risk factors for CDAD. The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for endemic CDAD, including CDAD pressure, a modified version of colonization pressure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 36,086 patients admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO) during the period from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2003. Administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy data were collected from electronic hospital databases. Colonization pressure was measured through a surrogate variable (i.e., CDAD pressure). Multivariable pooled logistic regression models were used to evaluate independent risk factors for CDAD. RESULTS: The analysis included 382 CDAD case patient admissions and 35,704 non-case patient admissions. Significant independent risk factors for CDAD included increasing age, admission(s) in the previous 60 days, hypoalbuminemia, leukemia and/or lymphoma, mechanical ventilation, and receipt of antimotility drugs, histamine-2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, intravenous vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, and first-, third-, or fourth-generation cephalosporins. Increasing CDAD pressure was a strong risk factor for CDAD (for a CDAD pressure >1.4, the odds ratio was 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-5.6).

Both the molecule and the receptors may occur in membrane and soluble forms, except for OPG which has only a soluble form. The aim of the study was to assess the levels of sTRAIL molecule and soluble TRAIL receptors - sTRAIL-R2 and OPG in the serum of patients with B-CLL. The findings revealed reduced concentrations of sTRAIL both before and after treatment and elevated levels of sTRAIL-R2 and OPG in patients before treatment. After treatment with CC (2CdA/Cladrybin and Cyklofosfamid) and FC (Fludarabin and Cyklofosfamid) we observed an increase in sTRAIL and a decrease in sTRAIL-R2. OPG levels were found to increase after treatment with CHOP (Vincristini, Cyklofosfamid, Adriamycin and Prednisol) and they decreased after administration of Leukeran (Chlorambucyl) and CMC (2CdA/Cladrybin, Mitoxanton and Cyklofosfamid). The relationships between TRAIL and its natural regulators in the serum of BCLL patients prior to treatment may impair apoptosis of leukemic B cells. Changes in these relationships after treatment with CC and FC seem to promote enhancement of apoptosis in these cells.","['Jablonska, E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska, B', 'Aleksandrowicz-Bukin, M', 'Rogowski, F', 'Sawicka-Powierza, J']","['Jablonska E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska B', 'Aleksandrowicz-Bukin M', 'Rogowski F', 'Sawicka-Powierza J']","['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. ewaj@amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Osteoprotegerin/*blood', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*blood']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2008;55(1):51-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH) to determine the frequency of chromosomal changes in 33 children with acute leukaemia (AL). The yields of chromosomal abnormalities were compared with the results obtained using conventional cytogenetics (G-banding) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Conventional cytogenetics revealed chromosomal changes in 17 (52 %) of studied patients. The employment of FISH together with G-banding analysis identified chromosomal changes in 27 (82 %) of the AL patients investigated. CGH detected changes in DNA copy numbers in 24 (73 %) patients, 40 losses and 67 gains were found in total. HR-CGH disclosed 98 losses and 97 gains in 26 (79 %) patients. In comparison with CGH, HR-CGH analyses unveiled 88 new chromosomal aberrations: 58 losses and 30 gains. The most commonly gained chromosomes were 21 (22.5 %), X (15 %), 18 (12,5 %) and 17 (10 %). The most common losses involved sub-regions or arms of chromosomes 7 (15 %), 9 (12.5 %), 16, 19 and 1 (10 % each). Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analyses of 33 childhood acute leukaemias revealed chromosomal changes in total 31 (94 %) patients. The evaluation of HR-CGH sensitivity proved that the minimal cell population of malignant cells in which a certain chromosomal change could be found was close to the 20 - 30 % level. Our results confirm the benefits of HR-CGH in detecting chromosomal changes in childhood AL. Supplementing G-banding and FISH with the HR-CGH diagnostic method increases the detection of unbalanced structural chromosomal rearrangements and can reveal small cell clones with gains and losses of whole chromosomes in hyperdiploid AL.","['Vranova, V', 'Mentzlova, D', 'Oltova, A', 'Linkova, V', 'Zezulkova, D', 'Filkova, H', 'Mendelova, D', 'Sterba, J', 'Kuglik, P']","['Vranova V', 'Mentzlova D', 'Oltova A', 'Linkova V', 'Zezulkova D', 'Filkova H', 'Mendelova D', 'Sterba J', 'Kuglik P']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2008;55(1):23-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a nonrandomized phase 2 trial, 41 patients who had previously untreated CLL or SLL and required treatment received 4 cycles of the fludarabine and rituximab combination followed 5 weeks later by 4 weeks (12 doses) of intravenous alemtuzumab therapy. The response to treatment was evaluated after completion of treatment with fludarabine and rituximab, and again after the completion of alemtuzumab consolidation. RESULTS: Initial treatment with the combination of fludarabine and rituximab was well tolerated, and produced a 71% overall response rate (13% complete response). Thirty-four patients began treatment with intravenous alemtuzumab, but this drug was relatively poorly tolerated when given at a short interval after fludarabine and rituximab, and only 20 patients (49% of total) were able to complete the prescribed course. Five patients had an improvement in their response with alemtuzumab; the final complete response rate was 21%. The median progression-free survival for the entire group was 42 months. Toxicity with alemtuzumab included infusion-related toxicity, myelosuppression, and opportunistic infections. CONCLUSIONS: The intravenous schedule of alemtuzumab employed in the trial was relatively poorly tolerated in this community-based trial. The relatively low complete response rates after treatment with the combination of fludarabine and rituximab and after the completion of treatment suggest that these abbreviated courses may compromise efficacy. The generalized use of alemtuzumab as consolidation therapy cannot yet be recommended for community practice. However, optimization of the route of administration, duration of treatment, and interval after completion of induction therapy may improve efficacy, and further investigation is ongoing.","['Hainsworth, John D', 'Vazquez, Elizabeth R', 'Spigel, David R', 'Raefsky, Eric', 'Bearden, James D', 'Saez, Ruben A', 'Greco, F Anthony']","['Hainsworth JD', 'Vazquez ER', 'Spigel DR', 'Raefsky E', 'Bearden JD', 'Saez RA', 'Greco FA']","['Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, USA. jhainsworth@tnonc.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2008/01/15 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/01/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23271 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Mar 15;112(6):1288-95. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23271.,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

She also developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypertension. Renal biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy that was clinically consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Some reports of HUS preceding ALL do exist. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that describes ALL and HUS presenting simultaneously.","['Sinha, Rajiv', 'AlAbbas, Abdullah', 'Dionne, Janis M', 'Hurley, Robert Morrison']","['Sinha R', 'AlAbbas A', 'Dionne JM', 'Hurley RM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Nephrology, British Columbia's Children's Hospital, 4480 Oak Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada. rajivsinha_in@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080109,Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Kidney Glomerulus/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00467-007-0703-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2008 May;23(5):835-9. doi: 10.1007/s00467-007-0703-z.

We previously reported that triptolide, a potent anticancer agent from a Chinese herb, decreases XIAP in leukemic cells. We evaluated the combination of triptolide and TRAIL and found synergistic promotion of apoptosis in AML cells. XIAP-overexpressing U937 cells (U937XIAP) were more resistant to TRAIL than U937neo cells, and inhibition of XIAP with the small-molecule inhibitor 1396-11 enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, implying XIAP as a resistance factor in AML. Furthermore, triptolide increased DR5 levels in OCI-AML3, while the DR5 increase was blunted in p53-knockdown OCI-AML3 and p53-mutated U937 cells, confirming a role for p53 in the regulation of DR5. In support of this finding, disruption of MDM2-p53 binding with subsequent increase in p53 levels by nutlin3a increased DR5 levels and sensitized OCI-AML3 cells to TRAIL. The combination of 1396-11 plus nutlin3a plus TRAIL was more effective than either the 1396-11 and TRAIL or nutlin3a and TRAIL combinations in OCI-AML3 cells, further supporting the role of triptolide as a sensitizer to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in part by independent modulation of XIAP expression and p53 signaling. Thus, the combination of triptolide and TRAIL may provide a novel strategy for treating AML by overcoming critical mechanisms of apoptosis resistance.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Dietrich, Martin F', 'Pinilla, Clemencia', 'Vassilev, Lyubomir T', 'Reed, John C', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak DH', 'Schober WD', 'Dietrich MF', 'Pinilla C', 'Vassilev LT', 'Reed JC', 'Andreeff M']","['The University of Texas M.

To determine whether miRNAs are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities and clinical features in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated the miRNA expression of CD34(+) cells and 122 untreated adult AML cases using a microarray platform. After background subtraction and normalization using a set of housekeeping genes, data were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. An independent set of 60 untreated AML patients was used to validate the outcome signatures using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We identified several miRNAs differentially expressed between CD34(+) normal cells and the AML samples. miRNA expression was also closely associated with selected cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, such as t(11q23), isolated trisomy 8, and FLT3-ITD mutations. Furthermore, patients with high expression of miR-191 and miR-199a had significantly worse overall and event-free survival than AML patients with low expression (overall survival: miR-191, P = .03; and miR-199a, P = .001, Cox regression).

However, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant V(D)J recombination. Translocations involving LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and Hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL/SCL, are cited examples of illegitimate V(D)J recombination. Previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support V(D)J recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide V(D)J recombination signals. To understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these cRSSs by the RAG1/2 proteins that initiate V(D)J recombination. We find that the RAG proteins comparably bind all cRSSs tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus RSS. We show that four cRSSs that support levels of V(D)J recombination above background levels in cell culture (LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and SIL) are also cleaved by the RAG proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus RSS. Cleavage of LMO2 and Ttg-1 by the RAG proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated PCR. In contrast, Hox11 and SCL are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these cRSSs in cell culture.","['Zhang, Ming', 'Swanson, Patrick C']","['Zhang M', 'Swanson PC']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68178, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080109,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Sorting Signals', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'VDJ Recombinases/*chemistry/metabolism']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)57107-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M710301200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Mar 14;283(11):6717-27. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M710301200.

We used Cox regression to model NHL risk with age as the time metric while adjusting for age at baseline, ethnicity, education, alcohol intake, and age at first live birth. Body weight and body mass index at age 21 were stronger predictors of NHL risk than anthropometric characteristics at baseline. For men, being in the highest quartile of body mass index and body weight at age 21 conferred a nonsignificant 86% and 41% higher NHL risk, respectively, whereas there was no association at baseline. For women, the risk associated with the highest quartile of weight at age 21 was 1.6 (P(trend) = 0.04), whereas women in the highest quartile at baseline had a nonsignificant risk of 27%. Height was positively related to NHL in men and women. Despite the small numbers, there was some consistency for risk estimates across ethnic groups and weak evidence for an association with NHL subtypes. These findings indicate that weight at age 21 may represent lifetime adiposity better than body weight at cohort entry. Alternatively, weight at age 21 may be more relevant for the etiology of NHL.","['Maskarinec, Gertraud', 'Erber, Eva', 'Gill, Jasmeet', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Kolonel, Laurence N']","['Maskarinec G', 'Erber E', 'Gill J', 'Cozen W', 'Kolonel LN']","['Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, 1236 Lauhala Street, Honolulu, HI 96813, USA. gertraud@crch.hawaii.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080109,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Aged', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Overweight/complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-07-0716 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0716 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2008 Jan;17(1):196-203. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0716.

Recently, studies have shown that a chemopreventive effect of curcumin could be due to the hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. In our previous studies, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) overexpression prevented tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)- and methotrexate-induced apoptosis via reduction of ROS. Furthermore, ODC is the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis and a target for chemoprevention. In this study, we found that enzyme activity and protein expression of ODC were reduced during curcumin treatment. Overexpression of ODC in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 parental cells could reduce curcumin-induced apoptosis, which leads to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), through reducing intracellular ROS. Moreover, ODC overexpression prevented cytochrome c release and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 following curcumin treatment. These results demonstrate that curcumin-induced apoptosis occurs through a mechanism of down-regulating ODC and along a ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated pathway.","['Liao, Ya-Fan', 'Hung, Hui-Chih', 'Hour, Tzyh-Chyuan', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Kao, Ming-Ching', 'Tsay, Gregory J', 'Liu, Guang-Yaw']","['Liao YF', 'Hung HC', 'Hour TC', 'Hsu PC', 'Kao MC', 'Tsay GJ', 'Liu GY']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071207,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 9/biosynthesis', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/enzymology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/physiology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(07)00854-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2007.11.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2008 Feb 13;82(7-8):367-75. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2007.11.022.

Although NF-kappaB inhibition is predicted to affect osteoclast function, preclinical and clinical studies have primarily reported an effect on osteoblasts.

Thirty-nine patients received 2 cycles of bortezomib on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle. After high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle was administered as maintenance therapy. RESULTS: During posttransplantation bortezomib, decreases in the urinary excretion of collagen N-telopeptide indicated that bortezomib suppresses osteoclast function. CONCLUSION: The effects on osteoclasts occurred in the absence of bisphosphonate treatment and independently of changes in monoclonal protein levels. Further studies exploring the role of bortezomib as a bone protective agent could be warranted.","['Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Trivedi, Rachna', 'Peles, Shachar', 'Fisher, Nicholas M', 'Zhang, Qin Jean', 'Tomasson, Michael H', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Vij, Ravi']","['Uy GL', 'Trivedi R', 'Peles S', 'Fisher NM', 'Zhang QJ', 'Tomasson MH', 'DiPersio JF', 'Vij R']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bortezomib', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/*pathology', 'Patient Selection', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/01/31 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1557-9190(11)70110-X [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2007.n.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2007 Nov;7(9):587-9. doi: 10.3816/clm.2007.n.045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 38 previously untreated patients with HCL to characterize their complete (VDJ(H)) and incomplete (DJ(H)) immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (IgH) rearrangements, including somatic hypermutation pattern and gene segment use. RESULTS: A correlation between immunophenotypic profile and molecular data was seen. All 38 cases showed monoclonal amplifications: VDJ(H) in 97%, DJ(H) in 42%, and both in 39%. Segments from the D(H)3 family were used more in complete compared with incomplete rearrangements (45% vs. 12%; P < .005). Furthermore, comparison between molecular and immunophenotypic characteristics disclosed differences in the expression of CD25 antigen; CD25(-) cases, a phenotype associated with HCL variant, showed complete homology to the germline in 3 of 5 cases (60%), whereas this characteristic was never observed in CD25(+) cases (P < .005). Moreover, V(H)4-34, V(H)1-08, and J(H)3 segments appeared in 2, 1, and 2 CD25(-) cases, respectively, whereas they were absent in all CD25(+) cases.

Cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction: S82F in the Moloney variant Spl574, and S84A in the Friend mouse leukemia virus F-S MLV. Because M. dunni cells carry a variant CAT-1 cell surface virus receptor (dCAT-1), we examined the role of this receptor variant in cytopathicity and host range. RESULTS: We expressed dCAT-1 or mCAT-1 of NIH 3T3 origin in cells that are not normally infectible with ecotropic MLVs and evaluated the transfectants for susceptibility to virus infection and to virus-induced syncytium formation. The dCAT-1 transfectants, but not the mCAT-1 transfectants, were susceptible to virus-induced cytopathicity, and this cytopathic response was accompanied by the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA. The dCAT-1 transfectants, however, did not also reproduce the relative resistance of M. dunni cells to Moloney MLV, and the mCAT-1 transfectants did not show the relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Spl574. Western analysis, use of glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove receptor glycosylation sites identified a possible role for cell-specific glycosylation in the modulation of virus entry. CONCLUSION: Virus entry and virus-induced syncytium formation using the CAT-1 receptor are mediated by a small number of critical amino acid residues in receptor and virus Env. Virus entry is modulated by glycosylation of cellular proteins, and this effect is cell and virus-specific.","['Yan, Yuhe', 'Jung, Yong T', 'Wu, Tiyun', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Yan Y', 'Jung YT', 'Wu T', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20892-0460, USA. yyan@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080110,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (Slc7a1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Giant Cells/*physiology', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Virus Internalization']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-2 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Jan 10;5:2. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-2.,,PMC2248597,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, our retrospective study describes the clinical features and variables related to evolution in a large group of patients with CD5/CD10-negative chronic B-cell lymphoid leukemias and underlines the fact that a probable lymphoplasmacytic or marginal zone normal cell origin can be supposed in such leukemic forms, but never surely demonstrated.","['Goldaniga, Maria', 'Ferrario, Andrea', 'Cortelazzo, Sergio', 'Guffanti, Andrea', 'Pavone, Enzo', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Marcheselli, Luigi', 'Rossi, Francesca', 'Luminari, Stefano', 'Rossi, Andrea', 'Cro, Lilla', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Baldini, Luca']","['Goldaniga M', 'Ferrario A', 'Cortelazzo S', 'Guffanti A', 'Pavone E', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Marcheselli L', 'Rossi F', 'Luminari S', 'Rossi A', 'Cro L', 'Federico M', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Baldini L']","['UO Ematologia e Centro Trapianti di Midollo, Ospedale Maggiore, IRCCS, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. mariacecilia.goldaniga@virgilio.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*chemistry/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21065 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 May;83(5):349-54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21065.,,,,,['Am J Hematol. 2008 May;83(5):347-8.

METHODS: The mainstay for the management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is supportive therapy with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to improve the patient's quality of life. RBC transfusions enable adequate tissue oxygenation and increase hemoglobin levels, improve fatigue, and improve the physical and intellectual activity of patients. Up to 90% of patients with MDS will receive RBC transfusions during the course of their disease, and many will become chronically dependent on transfusions to manage their anemia. These transfusions lead to an accumulation of excess iron that, in turn, can develop into a condition known as iron overload, causing clinical consequences like hypertransaminasemia and cirrhosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and progressive dysfunction of the endocrine glands. RESULTS: Studies in patients with MDS have indicated that iron overload because of RBC transfusions was an independent, adverse prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS): OS and LFS were significantly shorter in transfusion-dependent patients with MDS than in those who were not transfusion dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the treatment of patients with MDS recommend the use of RBC transfusions as supportive care, they further recommend that the iron burden of transfused patients be monitored regularly and that iron chelation therapy be considered to maintain serum ferritin levels of <1000 ng/mL.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Koller, Charles', 'Taher, Ali']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Koller C', 'Taher A']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis', 'Iron Overload/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/epidemiology/*therapy']",2008/01/12 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/12 09:00'],"['2008/01/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23280 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Mar 1;112(5):1089-95. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23280.,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation is commonly associated with TSG silencing, yet mutations in the DNA methylation initiation and recognition machinery in carcinogenesis are unknown. An intriguing possible mechanism for gene regulation involves widespread non-coding RNAs such as microRNA, Piwi-interacting RNA and antisense RNAs. Widespread sense-antisense transcripts have been systematically identified in mammalian cells, and global transcriptome analysis shows that up to 70% of transcripts have antisense partners and that perturbation of antisense RNA can alter the expression of the sense gene. For example, it has been shown that an antisense transcript not naturally occurring but induced by genetic mutation leads to gene silencing and DNA methylation, causing thalassaemia in a patient. Here we show that many TSGs have nearby antisense RNAs, and we focus on the role of one RNA in silencing p15, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in leukaemia. We found an inverse relation between p15 antisense (p15AS) and p15 sense expression in leukaemia. A p15AS expression construct induced p15 silencing in cis and in trans through heterochromatin formation but not DNA methylation; the silencing persisted after p15AS was turned off, although methylation and heterochromatin inhibitors reversed this process. The p15AS-induced silencing was Dicer-independent. Expression of exogenous p15AS in mouse embryonic stem cells caused p15 silencing and increased growth, through heterochromatin formation, as well as DNA methylation after differentiation of the embryonic stem cells. Thus, natural antisense RNA may be a trigger for heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation in TSG silencing in tumorigenesis.","['Yu, Wenqiang', 'Gius, David', 'Onyango, Patrick', 'Muldoon-Jacobs, Kristi', 'Karp, Judith', 'Feinberg, Andrew P', 'Cui, Hengmi']","['Yu W', 'Gius D', 'Onyango P', 'Muldoon-Jacobs K', 'Karp J', 'Feinberg AP', 'Cui H']","['Center for Epigenetics and Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 720 Rutland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature06468 [pii]', '10.1038/nature06468 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 Jan 10;451(7175):202-6. doi: 10.1038/nature06468.,,PMC2743558,"['R01 CA054358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA054358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA054358-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS113858'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current medical therapeutic options have not demonstrated an impact on the disease course, which exceeds the palliation of disease-related extramedullary hematopoiesis and alleviation of cytopenias. In contrast, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can lead to 'cure' but is limited due to patient's age or comorbidities. Currently, in patients, who are reasonable candidates, SCT (frequently with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen) is employed for intermediate- to high-risk disease. Current pharmaco-medical therapy is used as a bridge to transplant, or instead of transplant in poor transplant candidates. Pathogenetic insights, especially the discovery of the Janus kinase (JAK)2(V617F) mutation, have ushered in a host of new potential therapeutic agents that may augment the role of medical therapy. Similarly, the boundaries of transplantation continue to alter with strategies that decrease conditioning-related toxicity, improved antimicrobial prophylaxis and decreased graft-versus-host disease. The potential for continued improvements in both medical and transplant therapy suggests that for the immediate future the optimal choices for an individual patient will remain potentially volatile and present complex decisions.","['Kroger, N', 'Mesa, R A']","['Kroger N', 'Mesa RA']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080110,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Androgens/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Cytostatic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Disease Management', 'Drugs, Investigational/therapeutic use', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Etanercept', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Palliative Care', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/surgery', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy/genetics/surgery/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/therapeutic use', 'Risk', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy/surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405080 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405080 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):474-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405080.

Although a number of collaborating genetic events have been identified in TLX3 rearranged T-ALL patients (NOTCH1 mutations, p15/p16 deletions, NUP214-ABL1 amplifications), further elucidation of additional genetic lesions could provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this specific T-ALL subtype.

This is the first report of expression of E2A fusion protein that includes the DNA binding and protein dimerization domains due to a more proximal break in E2A compared to those described previously.","['Zhong, C-h', 'Prima, V', 'Liang, X', 'Frye, C', 'McGavran, L', 'Meltesen, L', 'Wei, Q', 'Boomer, T', 'Varella-Garcia, M', 'Gump, J', 'Hunger, S P']","['Zhong CH', 'Prima V', 'Liang X', 'Frye C', 'McGavran L', 'Meltesen L', 'Wei Q', 'Boomer T', 'Varella-Garcia M', 'Gump J', 'Hunger SP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080110,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (ZNF384 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (NOP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (tRNA Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'tRNA Methyltransferases']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405084 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405084 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):723-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405084.

The median number of MSCs infused was 3.4 x 10(5) kg(-1) (range, 0.3-15.3 x 10(5) kg(-1)). MSCs infusions were well tolerated. The median time to neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 10(9) l(-1)) was 16 days for MSCs group and 15 days for non-MSCs group. The median time to platelet engraftment (platelet count >50 x 10(9) l(-1)) was 30 and 27 days, respectively. Grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed respectively, in one (11.1%) and eight (53.3%) evaluable patients. Chronic GVHD was found in one (14.3%) and four (28.6%) evaluable patients. The number of patients who relapsed were six (60.0%) and three (20.0%), and the 3-year disease-free survivals were 30.0 and 66.7%, respectively. Thus cotransplantation of MSCs and HSCs may prevent GVHD, but the relapse rate is obviously higher than the control group. We conclude that use of MSCs must be handled with extreme caution before a large-scale clinical trial is performed.","['Ning, H', 'Yang, F', 'Jiang, M', 'Hu, L', 'Feng, K', 'Zhang, J', 'Yu, Z', 'Li, B', 'Xu, C', 'Li, Y', 'Wang, J', 'Hu, J', 'Lou, X', 'Chen, H']","['Ning H', 'Yang F', 'Jiang M', 'Hu L', 'Feng K', 'Zhang J', 'Yu Z', 'Li B', 'Xu C', 'Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Hu J', 'Lou X', 'Chen H']","[""Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Affiliated Hospital to Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080110,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*surgery', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405090 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405090 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):593-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405090.

However, the precise mechanisms by which these factors interact to form transcriptional networks, as well as the identity of the genes downstream of these regulatory cascades, remain largely unknown. To this end, we generated an Scl(-/-) yolk sac cell line to identify candidate Scl target genes by global expression profiling after reintroduction of a TAT-Scl fusion protein. Bioinformatics analysis resulted in the identification of 9 candidate Scl target transcription factor genes, including Runx1 and Runx3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that both Runx genes are direct targets of Scl in the fetal liver and that Runx1 is also occupied by Scl in the yolk sac. Furthermore, binding of an Scl-Lmo2-Gata2 complex was demonstrated to occur on the regions flanking the conserved E-boxes of the Runx1 loci and was shown to transactivate the Runx1 element. Together, our data provide a key component of the transcriptional network of early hematopoiesis by identifying downstream targets of Scl that can explain key aspects of the early Scl(-/-) phenotype.","['Landry, Josette-Renee', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Knezevic, Kathy', 'de Bruijn, Marella F T R', 'Wilson, Nicola', 'Nottingham, Wade T', 'Peitz, Michael', 'Edenhofer, Frank', 'Pimanda, John E', 'Ottersbach, Katrin', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Landry JR', 'Kinston S', 'Knezevic K', 'de Bruijn MF', 'Wilson N', 'Nottingham WT', 'Peitz M', 'Edenhofer F', 'Pimanda JE', 'Ottersbach K', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Liver/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Yolk Sac/*embryology/*metabolism']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48609-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-098830 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 15;111(6):3005-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-098830.

This up-regulation of Aiolos, confirmed at protein level, seems independent of Aiolos promoter H3K9 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation.","['Duhamel, Marianne', 'Arrouss, Issam', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Rebollo, Angelita']","['Duhamel M', 'Arrouss I', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Rebollo A']","['Immunologie Cellulaire et Tissulaire, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (IKZF3 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', '*Up-Regulation']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48634-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-113191 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 15;111(6):3225-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-113191.

We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine regional gray and white matter differences in a group of long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared with a group of healthy controls. Differences in regional white matter volume were expected, given previous reports of white matter changes during treatment for ALL and reduced brain white matter volumes in long-term survivors. Follow-up analyses examined the relationship of regional brain volumes to cognitive function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 9 long-term survivors of ALL with 14 healthy controls. Survivors of ALL were treated with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy only. T1-weighted axial 3D spoiled gradient high-resolution images collected on a 1.5T MR imaging scanner were used for the VBM analysis. Neuropsychological evaluations were conducted within 2 months of the MR imaging to assess cognitive function. RESULTS: VBM analysis revealed 2 specific regions of reduced white matter in the right frontal lobes of survivors of ALL compared with healthy controls. Survivors of ALL had lower performances on tests of attention, visual-constructional skills, mental flexibility, and math achievement compared with healthy individuals. Decreased performance on neuropsychological measures was associated with decreased regional white matter volumes. No differences were found between the groups with respect to gray matter regions. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with previous literature describing the long-term cognitive, academic, and imaging findings of survivors of ALL and suggest that right frontal white matter is particularly vulnerable to disruption following intensive chemotherapy for ALL. Future studies should focus on further clarifying the white matter changes observed.","['Carey, M E', 'Haut, M W', 'Reminger, S L', 'Hutter, J J', 'Theilmann, R', 'Kaemingk, K L']","['Carey ME', 'Haut MW', 'Reminger SL', 'Hutter JJ', 'Theilmann R', 'Kaemingk KL']","['Departments of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA. mcarey@hsc.wvu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080109,United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). To see whether NOTCH1 mutation occurs in other malignancies, we analyzed NOTCH1 for the detection of somatic mutations in 334 malignancies, including 48 lung, 48 breast, 48 colorectal and 48 gastric carcinomas, and 142 acute leukemias (105 acute myelogenous leukemias, 32 B-ALLs and 4 T-ALLs) by single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. Also, to see whether other NOTCH genes harbor somatic mutations, we analyzed NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4 genes in the same tissue samples. Overall, we detected three NOTCH mutations in the cancers, which consisted of one NOTCH1 mutation in the T-ALLs (25.0%), one NOTCH2 mutation in the breast carcinomas (2.1%), and one NOTCH3 mutation in the colorectal carcinomas (2.0%). There was no NOTCH mutation in other malignancies analyzed. Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers. Despite the importance of NOTCH activation in many types of human cancers, mutation of NOTCH genes, except for NOTCH1 mutation in T-ALL, may not play an important role in the tumorigenesis of common cancers.","['Lee, Sung Hak', 'Jeong, Eun Goo', 'Yoo, Nam Jin', 'Lee, Sug Hyung']","['Lee SH', 'Jeong EG', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH4 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch2/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics']",2008/01/11 09:00,2008/03/13 09:00,['2008/01/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['APMapm_751.xml [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0463.2007.00751.x [doi]']",ppublish,APMIS. 2007 Dec;115(12):1357-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2007.00751.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But no data have been available up to date concerning mutual positioning of these particular genes in the nucleus of a living cell as well as the mechanism of their rapprochement and realignment. Here we show that there is no proximity between these two genes in the primary nuclei of normal human male fibroblasts and moreover that these genes are located in different nuclear layers. But we further show that treatment of cells with VP-16 (etoposide), an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II widely used in anticancer chemotherapy, causes the ETO gene repositioning which allows AML1 and ETO genes to be localized in the same nuclear layer. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that such an effect is likely to be connected with the formation of stalled cleavable complexes on DNA. Finally, inhibition of ETO gene repositioning by 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) suggests that this process depends on nuclear myosin. Together, our data corroborate the so called ""breakage first"" model of the origins of recurrent reciprocal translocation.","['Rubtsov, Mikhail A', 'Terekhov, Sergey M', 'Razin, Sergey V', 'Iarovaia, Olga V']","['Rubtsov MA', 'Terekhov SM', 'Razin SV', 'Iarovaia OV']","['Laboratory of Structural and Functional Organization of Chromosomes, Institute of Gene Biology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 34/5 Vavilov Street, 119334 Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myosins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21656 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 May 15;104(2):692-9. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21656.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD23 antigen, a trans-membrane glycoprotein, promotes the activation and proliferation of normal B lymphocytes and has an important role in the process of malignant transformation in B-CLL. This retrospective cohort study of 77 consecutive newly diagnosed B-CLL patients, 43 males, 34 females, median age of 62 years, examined CD23 expression and correlations with clinical parameters. CD23+ was negatively correlated with pro-lymphocyte infiltration of the bone marrow (P<0.01) and peripheral blood lymphocyte counts (P<0.001). Lower CD23 expression was correlated with lower serum immunoglobulin levels (P<0.05), especially IgG; while greater CD23 expression was positively correlated with higher CD5 levels. B-CLL patients with a percentage of CD23+ lymphocytes >40% had longer survival (92.8 months) than those expressing <40% (35.3 months) (P=0.001). CD23 is not uniformly expressed by lymphocytes in B-CLL patients, and the differences in expression are dependent on a number of clinical parameters, including the peripheral blood lymphocyte count and the degree of pro-lymphocyte infiltration of the bone marrow. CD23 expression is significantly decreased in patients with extremely high lymphocyte counts (PBL counts of >100 x 10(9)/l) and in the advanced stages of disease.","['Jurisic, Vladimir', 'Colovic, Natasa', 'Kraguljac, Nada', 'Atkinson, Henry Dushan', 'Colovic, Milica']","['Jurisic V', 'Colovic N', 'Kraguljac N', 'Atkinson HD', 'Colovic M']","['Institute of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Dr Koste Todorovica 2, Belgrade, Serbia. vdvd@mailcity.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080109,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12032-007-9038-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2008;25(3):315-22. doi: 10.1007/s12032-007-9038-7.

The prognostic value of DNA index was explored in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,744 patients were enrolled (115, SR; 1,385, IR; and 244, HR). SR patients (DNA index >/= 1.16 and < 1.60; age, 1 to 5 years; and WBC < 20,000, non-T-immunophenotype, with no high-risk features) received a reduced induction therapy (no anthracyclines); IR patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive vincristine and dexamethasone pulses during maintenance; HR therapy was based on a conventional BFM schedule intensified with three chemotherapy blocks followed by a double reinduction phase. RESULTS: The event-free survival and overall survival probabilities at 10 years for the entire group were 72.5% (SE, 1.3) and 83.6% (SE, 0.9); 85.0% (SE, 3.4) and 95.5% (SE, 2.0) in SR, 75.1% (SE, 1.5) and 87.5% (SE, 0.9) in IR, and 51.0% (SE, 3.2) and 57.2% (SE, 3.3) in HR patients, respectively. Patients with a favorable DNA index had superior EFS in both IR (83.8% [2.7%] v 73.9% [1.7%]) and in HR (67.8% [9.4%] and 49.6% [3.5%]). Of the six patients with DNA index less than 0.8, only one remained in remission. CONCLUSION: Favorable DNA index was associated with a better prognosis in IR and HR patients defined by presenting clinical criteria and treatment with a BFM-oriented chemotherapy.","['Arico, Maurizio', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Luciani, Matteo', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Parasole, Rosanna', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Conter, Valentino']","['Arico M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Rizzari C', 'Barisone E', 'Biondi A', 'Casale F', 'Locatelli F', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Luciani M', 'Messina C', 'Micalizzi C', 'Parasole R', 'Pession A', 'Santoro N', 'Testi AM', 'Silvestri D', 'Basso G', 'Masera G', 'Conter V']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Ospedale dei Bambini G.

We conducted a phase I-II trial of oxaliplatin, fludarabine, cytarabine, and rituximab (OFAR) in these diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The OFAR regimen consisted of increasing doses of oxaliplatin (17.5, 20, or 25 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1 to 4 (phase I), fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) on days 2 to 3, cytarabine 1 g/m(2) on days 2 to 3, rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 3 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles, and pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 6, every 4 weeks for a maximum of six courses. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any nonhematologic, treatment-related toxicity >/= grade 3. RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated (20 patients had RS, and 30 had CLL). The highest tolerated oxaliplatin dose was 25 mg/m(2), which was the highest dose tested. DLT was not observed. Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated enhanced leukemia cell killing by oxaliplatin in the presence of fludarabine and cytarabine. The overall response rates were 50% in RS and 33% in fludarabine-refractory CLL. The overall response rate in 14 patients with age >/= 70 years was 50%. Responses were achieved in seven (35%) of 20 patients with 17p deletion, two (29%) of seven patients with 11q deletion, all four patients with trisomy 12, and two (40%) of five patients with 13q deletion. The median response duration was 10 months. Toxicities were mainly hematologic; prolonged myelosuppression was not observed. CONCLUSION: The OFAR regimen is highly active in RS and has activity in fludarabine-refractory patients with CLL. This regimen warrants further investigation in the treatment of these disorders.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia M', 'Wierda, William G', 'Plunkett, William', 'Kurzrock, Razelle', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wen, Sijin', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Fiorentino, Albert', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Wierda WG', 'Plunkett W', 'Kurzrock R', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wen S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Estrov Z', 'Kipps TJ', 'Brown JR', 'Fiorentino A', 'Lerner S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 455, Houston, TX 77030, USA. atsimber@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Research Design', 'Rituximab', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/2/196 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.11.8513 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):196-203. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.11.8513.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade immune defenses and to persist in the host by establishing a latent infection. Proliferation is necessary for pretumor cells to accumulate genetic alterations and to acquire a transformed phenotype. However, each cell division is associated with a progressive shortening of the telomeres, which can suppress tumor development by initiating senescence and irreversible cell cycle arrest. Therefore, the ability of virus-infected cells to circumvent the senescence program is essential for the long-term survival and proliferation of infected cells and the likelihood of transformation. We review the multiple strategies used by human DNA and RNA tumor viruses to subvert telomerase functions during cellular transformation and carcinogenesis. Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 each can increase transcription of the telomerase reverse transcriptase. Several viruses appear to mediate cis-activation or enhance epigenetic activation of telomerase transcription. Epstein-Barr virus and human papillomavirus have each developed posttranscriptional mechanisms to regulate the telomerase protein. Finally, some tumor virus proteins can also negatively regulate telomerase transcription or activity. It is likely that, as future studies further expose the strategies used by viruses to deregulate telomerase activity and control of telomere length, novel mechanisms will emerge and underscore the importance of increased telomerase activity in sustaining virus-infected cells and its potential in therapeutic targeting.","['Bellon, Marcia', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bellon M', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3025 Wahl Hall West, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20080108,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cellular Senescence', 'DNA Viruses', 'Deltaretrovirus', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis B virus', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*virology', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Papillomaviridae', 'RNA Viruses', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/*metabolism/*virology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/*enzymology/virology', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/01/29 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['djm269 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djm269 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2008 Jan 16;100(2):98-108. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djm269.

Based on this, we hypothesized that IL-21 might enhance the apoptosis induced by fludarabine and rituximab and also play a role in augmenting immune-mediated clearance of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Our studies demonstrate that the majority of CLL patients have surface IL-21 receptor-alpha, and its expression correlates with apoptosis, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, and up-regulation of the proapoptotic BH3 domain protein BIM. IL-21-induced BIM up-regulation is critical for apoptosis because inhibition of BIM expression using small interfering RNA prevented IL-21-induced apoptosis. IL-21 treatment of CLL cells but not normal T cells with fludarabine or rituximab additively enhanced the direct cytotoxic effect of these therapies. In addition to its proapoptotic effect, IL-21 promoted STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation in natural killer cells with concurrent enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against rituximab-coated CLL cells in vitro. These data provide justification for combination studies of IL-21 with fludarabine and rituximab in CLL and suggest that BIM up-regulation might serve as relevant pharmacodynamic end point to measure biologic effect of this cytokine in vivo.","['Gowda, Aruna', 'Roda, Julie', 'Hussain, Syed-Rehan A', 'Ramanunni, Asha', 'Joshi, Trupti', 'Schmidt, Susan', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Carson, William E', 'Kindsvogel, Wayne', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Gowda A', 'Roda J', 'Hussain SR', 'Ramanunni A', 'Joshi T', 'Schmidt S', 'Zhang X', 'Lehman A', 'Jarjoura D', 'Carson WE', 'Kindsvogel W', 'Cheney C', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Tridandapani S', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Rituximab', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41163-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-099531 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4723-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-099531.

Though TL resolves spontaneously in most patients, early death and development of myeloid leukemia (ML-DS) may occur. Prognostic factors as well as treatment indication are currently uncertain. To resolve that issue, we prospectively collected clinical, biologic, and treatment data of 146 patients with TL. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 85% plus or minus 3% and 63% plus or minus 4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed a correlation between high white blood cell (WBC) count, ascites, preterm delivery, bleeding diatheses, failure of spontaneous remission, and the occurrence of early death. Treatment with cytarabine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) was administered to 28 patients with high WBC count, thrombocytopenia, or liver dysfunction. The therapy had a beneficial effect on the outcome of those children with risk factors for early death (5-year EFS, 52% +/- 12% vs 28% +/- 11% [no treatment]; P = .02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated its favorable prognostic impact. A total of 29 (23%) patients with TL subsequently developed ML-DS. Patients with ML-DS with a history of TL had a significantly better 5-year EFS (91% +/- 5%) than those without documented TL (70% +/- 4%), primarily due to a lower relapse rate. A history of TL may therefore define a lower-risk ML-DS subgroup. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as no.

The altered translational specificity could be explained by perturbation (protein degradation, truncation, or dephosphorylation) of the cap-dependent translation initiation machinery and of proteins control-ing translation of specific mRNAs. We propose that judiciously timed inhibition of cap-independent translation is considered for combination therapy with anthracyclines in AML.","['Gausdal, Gro', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Van Damme, Petra', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Krakstad, Camilla', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Gevaert, Kris', 'Vandekerckhove, Joel', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove']","['Gausdal G', 'Gjertsen BT', 'McCormack E', 'Van Damme P', 'Hovland R', 'Krakstad C', 'Bruserud O', 'Gevaert K', 'Vandekerckhove J', 'Doskeland SO']","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51568-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-103242 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 1;111(5):2866-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-103242.

A preleukemic step is characterized by an acute proliferation of proerythroblasts due to the arrest of differentiation provoked by Spi-1/PU.1. Later on, a blastic crisis occurs associated with somatic oncogenic mutations in the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor kit. To gain insights into the mechanisms of the leukemic progression, we performed proteomic profiling analyses of proerythroblasts isolated at the 2 stages of the disease. Our results indicate that the level of ezrin, a membrane cytoskeletal crosslinker, is increased in the leukemic cells. We show that Kit oncogenic forms are responsible for ezrin phosphorylation and that phosphorylation rather than overexpression is essential in the leukemic proerythroblasts. Using expression of dominant-negative forms of ezrin, we show that phosphorylation of ezrin on residue Y353 participates in apoptosis resistance, whereas phosphorylation on residue Y145 promotes proliferation of the leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Another recurrent oncogenic form of tyrosine kinases (Flt3) most frequently involved in human myeloid leukemia was also able to phosphorylate ezrin. These findings point to a new role for ezrin as signaling player in the development of leukemia, being a downstream effector of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in leukemic blasts.","['Monni, Richard', 'Haddaoui, Lamya', 'Naba, Alexandra', 'Gallais, Isabelle', 'Arpin, Monique', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise']","['Monni R', 'Haddaoui L', 'Naba A', 'Gallais I', 'Arpin M', 'Mayeux P', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","['Inserm U830, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (ezrin)', '129712-62-5 (lambda Spi-1)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/01/10 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48627-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-110510 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 15;111(6):3163-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-110510.

Overexpression of CALM leads to the reduction of cell surface VAMP2, whereas knockdown of CALM by RNA interference results in the accumulation of surface VAMP2.

The translocation results in a fusion between the nuclear phosphoprotein DEK and the nucleoporin NUP214 (previously CAN). The mechanism by which the fusion protein DEK-NUP214 contributes to leukemia development has not been identified, and disruptions of normal cellular functions by DEK-NUP214 have previously not been described. In the present study, a novel effect of the DEK-NUP214 fusion protein is demonstrated. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in global protein synthesis in DEK-NUP214 expressing cells. Furthermore, we conclude that this effect is not the result of dysregulated transcription but merely due to increased translation. Consistent with the association with AML, the increased protein synthesis mediated by DEK-NUP214 is restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage. Analysis of potential mechanisms for regulating protein synthesis shows that expression of DEK-NUP214 correlates to the phosphorylation of the translation initiation protein, EIF4E. The present data provide evidence that increase of translational activity constitutes a mechanism by which the leukemogenic effect of DEK-NUP124 may be mediated.","['Ageberg, Malin', 'Drott, Kristina', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Gullberg, Urban', 'Lindmark, Anders']","['Ageberg M', 'Drott K', 'Olofsson T', 'Gullberg U', 'Lindmark A']","['Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

EVI1 is also overexpressed in some cases without 3q26 rearrangements. To uncover its prognostic significance in this patient group, however, it may be necessary to distinguish among several known 5'-end variants of its mRNA. According to a recent report, overexpression of the transcript variant EVI1_1d was associated with shortened survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but overexpression of MDS1/EVI1, whose protein product differs structurally and functionally from that of all other known EVI1 5'-end variants, was not. The aim of the present study was to determine, for the first time, the expression and prognostic significance of all known EVI1 5'-end variants in AML. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of EVI1_1a, EVI1_1b, EVI1_1d, EVI1_3L, and MDS1/EVI1 in 266 samples from patients with de novo AML. To correlate expression of the EVI1 5'-end variants with survival parameters, regression analyses were performed. 41/266 patients (15.4%) overexpressed at least one, but more often several or all, EVI1 transcript type(s). High expression of each of the EVI1 mRNA variants, including MDS1/EVI1, was significantly associated with shortened continuous complete remission in the total patient population as well as in the subgroups of patients with intermediate risk or normal cytogenetics. The present study therefore shows that high levels of each of the known EVI1 mRNA 5'-end variants represents an adverse prognostic factor in de novo AML without 3q26 rearrangements.

In total, 142 genes were identified as being dependent on BCR/ABL1-mediated signaling, mainly including genes involved in signal transduction, e.g. the JAK/STAT, MAPK, TGFB, and insulin signaling pathways, and in regulation of metabolism. Interestingly, BCR/ABL1 was found to activate several genes involved in negative feedback regulation (CISH, SOCS2, SOCS3, PIM1, DUSP6, and TNFAIP3), which may act to indirectly suppress the tumor promoting effects exerted by BCR/ABL1. In addition, several genes identified as deregulated upon BCR/ABL1 expression could be assigned to the TGFB and NFkB signaling pathways, as well as to reflect the metabolic adjustments needed for rapidly growing cells. Apart from providing important pathogenetic insights into BCR/ABL1-mediated leukemogenesis, the present study also provides a number of pathways/individual genes that may provide attractive targets for future development of targeted therapies.

The BCR-ABL1 oncogene stimulates growth and survival pathways by phosphorylating numerous substrates, including various Src family members. Here we describe up-regulation, in contrast to activation, of the ubiquitously expressed Src kinase, Fyn, by BCR-ABL1. In a tissue microarray, Fyn expression was significantly increased in CML blast crisis compared with chronic phase. Cells overexpressing BCR-ABL1 in vitro and in vivo display an up-regulation of Fyn protein and mRNA. Knockdown of Fyn with shRNA slows leukemia cell growth, inhibits clonogenicity, and leads to increased sensitivity to imatinib, indicating that Fyn mediates CML cell proliferation. In severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice injected with Fyn shRNA-expressing cells, myeloid-derived cell numbers dropped by 50% and death from leukemia was delayed. Taken together, these results encourage the development of therapies targeting Fyn expression.","['Ban, Kechen', 'Gao, Yin', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Howard, Adrienne', 'Miller, Claudia', 'Lin, Quan', 'Leng, Xiaohong', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Bar-Eli, Menashe', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Ban K', 'Gao Y', 'Amin HM', 'Howard A', 'Miller C', 'Lin Q', 'Leng X', 'Munsell M', 'Bar-Eli M', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Chandra J']","['Department of Pediatrics Research, University of Texas M.

SPA-1(-/-) HPCs expressing C3G-F caused a more extensive expansion of DP thymocytes, resulting in lethal T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with massive invasion of clonal T-cell blasts into vital organs. The C3G-F(+) blastic thymocytes exhibited constitutive Rap1 activation and markedly enhanced expression of Notch1, 3 as well as the target genes, Hes1, pTalpha, and c-Myc. All the T-ALL cell lines from C3G-F(+) SPA-1(-/-) HPC recipients expressed high levels of Notch1 with characteristic mutations resulting in the C-terminal truncation. This proliferation was inhibited completely in the presence of a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Transplantation of Rag2(-/-) SPA-1(-/-) HPCs expressing C3G-F also resulted in a marked expansion and transformation of DP thymocytes. The results suggested that deregulated constitutive Rap1 activation caused abnormal expansion of DP thymocytes, bypassing the pre-T-cell receptor and eventually leading to Notch1 mutations and Notch-dependent T-ALL.","['Wang, Shu-Fang', 'Aoki, Misayo', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Shinozuka, Yoriko', 'Tanaka, Hiroki', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Hattori, Masakazu', 'Minato, Nagahiro']","['Wang SF', 'Aoki M', 'Nakashima Y', 'Shinozuka Y', 'Tanaka H', 'Taniwaki M', 'Hattori M', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Yoshida0konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080107,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Sipa1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/deficiency', 'Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency', 'Receptor, Notch1/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/01/09 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/01/09 09:00'],"['2008/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51569-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-103119 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 1;111(5):2878-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-103119.

In children and adolescents, MDS are uncommon disorders, accounting for less than 5% of hematopoietic malignancy, with great heterogeneity in presentation and clinical course. The genetic changes predisposing children to MDS are largely obscure. Monosomy 7 is the most common chromosomal abnormality, often occurring as a sole abnormality. The recent pediatric modification of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification has greatly facilitated the diagnostic process. Refractory cytopenia (RC) is the most common MDS subtype in children, occurring in about half of all MDS cases. There is consensus that the relationship between MDS with increased blast count and de novo AML is better defined by biological and clinical features than by blast count. Because monosomy 7 is the only chromosomal abnormality strongly suggestive of MDS, children presenting with a low blast count and other chromosomal aberrations or normal karyotype must be closely observed before a diagnosis of MDS can be established. With an increasing number of children surviving primary cancer with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the incidence of secondary therapy-related MDS is rising. The MDS risk is also increased in patients with inherited bone marrow failure disorders; this relationship provides valuable insights into MDS biology. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched related or suitable unrelated donor is the choice for most children with MDS and can rescue a large proportion of patients.","['Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Baumann, Irith']","['Niemeyer CM', 'Baumann I']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. charlotte.niemeyer@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Anemia, Refractory/genetics/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Monosomy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/01/09 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2008/01/09 09:00'],"['2008/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(07)00157-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2008 Jan;45(1):60-70. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.10.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because MDS occurs in a population of older adults with significant comorbidities, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been particularly important in extending safe SCT to the large MDS population over the age of 60 years. Extension of the unrelated donor pool together with the introduction of umbilical cord blood transplants in adults has extended the number of patients with suitable donors. Nevertheless overall mortality from SCT is greater than 50% because of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM). New developments to improve outcome include the tailoring of the transplant approach to the individual based on age and comorbidity, and the use of pretransplant chemotherapy to reduce disease bulk prior to transplant, as well as the introduction of post-transplant immunotherapy (pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusions) and chemotherapy to prevent relapse. Further improvements in transplant outcome await better ways to reconstitute immunity and amplify the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect without causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as well as further extension of the donor pool and exploration of risk-adapted regimens for the population of MDS in their seventh to eighth decade.","['Barrett, A John', 'Savani, Bipin N']","['Barrett AJ', 'Savani BN']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. barrettj@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/01/09 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2008/01/09 09:00'],"['2008/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(07)00156-4 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2008 Jan;45(1):49-59. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.10.005.,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These agents were developed based upon an understanding of the importance of epigenetic changes in malignancy, and they have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials, which demonstrate response rates between 20% and 40% in patients for whom no previous standard of care was available. As understanding of the epigenetic changes characteristic of the malignant phenotype improves, we are able to target other regulators of chromatin conformation that contribute to aberrant gene transcription and dysregulated cell growth. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors belong to one class of therapeutics developed using this paradigm. Although responses using HDAC inhibitors alone in MDS have been modest, robust preclinical data drive clinical trials in which they are utilized in combination with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.

Previous studies have demonstrated hyperactivation of p85alpha regulatory subunit of class IA phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) in cell lines expressing the activation loop mutant of KIT (KITD816V [human] and KITD814V [murine]). Although p85alpha is hyperphosphorylated and constitutively bound to KITD814V in cell-line models; the physiologic significance of this biochemical phenomenon in KITD814V-induced transformation is not known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we describe the generation of a new mouse model to study KITD814V-induced transformation in myeloid cells as opposed to previously described models that primarily result in the generation of disease resembling acute lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS: Our results show that transplantation of KITD814V expressing bone marrow cells from C57/BL6 strain of mice into syngeneic recipients results in a fatal MPD. Importantly, in this model, transplantation of KITD814V expressing p85alpha-deficient bone marrow cells rescues the MPD phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results describe the generation of a new murine transplant model to study KITD814V-induced transformation and identify p85alpha as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of KITD814V-bearing diseases.","['Munugalavadla, Veerendra', 'Sims, Emily C', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Lenz, Stephen D', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Munugalavadla V', 'Sims EC', 'Chan RJ', 'Lenz SD', 'Kapur R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080107,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/deficiency/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/pathology']",2008/01/09 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/01/09 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00664-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Mar;36(3):301-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.008.

In the context of a myeloid origin, extramedullary leukemias are referred to as granulocytic sarcomas, extramedullary myeloid tumors, extramedullary leukemias, or myeloid sarcomas. In the lymphoid category, leukemia involvement of tissue is conventionally distinguished from lymphoma by establishing the presence of 20% or more blasts in the bone marrow. A leukemia with an initial presentation outside the bone marrow mimicking a solid tumor is a rare but well-documented clinical encounter. Diagnostic difficulties may arise, especially when a specimen is not triaged properly due to the clinical presumption of a nonhematopoietic tumor.

Because HTLV-1 transmission depends on close cell-cell contacts, HTLV-1-infected T cells may preferentially interact with CCR4+CD4+ T cells for efficient viral transmission. In terms of gene expression and protein secretion, we found a strong correlation between HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein and CCL22, a CCR4 ligand, in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Transient Tax expression in an HTLV-1-negative T cell line activated the CCL22 promoter and induced CCL22. Additionally, tax gene knockdown by small interference RNA reduced CCL22 expression in the infected T cells. These findings indicate that CCL22 is a cellular target gene of Tax. In chemotaxis assays, the culture supernatants of HTLV-1-infected T cells selectively attracted CCR4+CD4+ T cells in PBMCs. This was blocked by pretreating the supernatants with anti-CCL22 Ab or PBMCs with a synthetic CCR4 antagonist. In coculture experiments, primary CCR4+CD4+ T cells significantly adhered to Tax-expressing cells. This adhesion was blocked by the CCR4 antagonist or pertussis toxin. Interestingly, CCR4 was redistributed to the contact region, and in some cases, this was accompanied by a polarized microtubule-organizing center, which is an indicator of virological synapse formation, in the infected T cells. Finally, anti-CCL22 Ab treatment also blocked HTLV-1 transmission to primary CD4+ T cells in coculture experiments with HTLV-1 producer cells. Thus, HTLV-1-infected T cells produce CCL22 through Tax and selectively interact with CCR4+CD4+ T cells, resulting in preferential transmission of HTLV-1 to CCR4+CD4+ T cells.","['Hieshima, Kunio', 'Nagakubo, Daisuke', 'Nakayama, Takashi', 'Shirakawa, Aiko-Konno', 'Jin, Zhe', 'Yoshie, Osamu']","['Hieshima K', 'Nagakubo D', 'Nakayama T', 'Shirakawa AK', 'Jin Z', 'Yoshie O']","['Department of Microbiology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan. hieshima@med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CCL22 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL22)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL22/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', '*Virus Internalization']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/03/11 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/2/931 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.2.931 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jan 15;180(2):931-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.2.931.,,,,,,,,,,,['J Immunol. 2008 Jun 15;180(12):8470'],,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that up-regulation of CD200 on tumor cells suppresses antitumor immune responses and that antagonistic anti-human CD200 mAbs enabled human PBMC-mediated tumor growth inhibition in xenograft NOD/SCID human (hu)-mouse models. Ab variants with effector function (IgG1 constant region (G1)) or without effector function (IgG2/G4 fusion constant region (G2G4)) exhibited high antitumor activity in a human tumor xenograft model in which CD200 was expressed. In this report, we seek to select the best candidate to move forward into the clinic and begin to decipher the mechanisms of tumor cell killing by comparing anti-CD200-G1 vs anti-CD200-G2G4 in two related animal models. In a CD200-expressing xenograft NOD/SCID hu-mouse model where CD200 ligand/receptor interactions are already established before initiating treatment, we find that anti-CD200-G1 is a less effective Ab compared with anti-CD200-G2G4. Separately, in a model that evaluates the effect of the Abs on the immune cell component of the xenograft NOD/SCID hu-mouse model distinctly from the effects of binding to CD200 on tumor cells, we find that the administration of anti-CD200-G1 Abs completely abolished human PBMC-mediated tumor growth inhibition. Along with supporting in vitro studies, our data indicate that anti-CD200-G1 Abs efficiently mediate Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of activated T cells, critical cells involved in immune-mediated killing. These studies suggest important implications regarding the selection of the constant region in anti-CD200 immunotherapy of cancer patients.","['Kretz-Rommel, Anke', 'Qin, Fenghua', 'Dakappagari, Naveen', 'Cofiell, Roxanne', 'Faas, Susan J', 'Bowdish, Katherine S']","['Kretz-Rommel A', 'Qin F', 'Dakappagari N', 'Cofiell R', 'Faas SJ', 'Bowdish KS']","['Alexion Antibody Technologies, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/03/11 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/2/699 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.2.699 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jan 15;180(2):699-705. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.2.699.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we compared the ability of the six human anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members to suppress apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bax or Bak, correlating findings with protein interactions measured by three different methods: co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pulldown, and fluorescence polarization assays employing synthetic BH3 peptides from Bax and Bak. Bcl-B and Mcl-1 showed strong preferences for binding to and suppression of Bax and Bak, respectively. In contrast, the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bcl-W, and Bfl-1) suppressed apoptosis induced by overexpression of either Bax or Bak, and they displayed an ability to bind both Bax and Bak by at least one of the three protein interaction methods. Interestingly, however, full-length Bax and Bak proteins and synthetic Bax and Bak BH3 peptides exhibited discernible differences in their interactions with some anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, cautioning against reliance on a single method for detecting protein interactions of functional significance. Altogether, the findings reveal striking distinctions in the behaviors of Bcl-B and Mcl-1 relative to the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, where Bcl-B and Mcl-1 display reciprocal abilities to bind and neutralize Bax and Bak.","['Zhai, Dayong', 'Jin, Chaofang', 'Huang, Ziwei', 'Satterthwait, Arnold C', 'Reed, John C']","['Zhai D', 'Jin C', 'Huang Z', 'Satterthwait AC', 'Reed JC']","['Burnham Institute for Medical Research, 10901 N.

Inhalation of vapors is the most likely route of exposure in the work place. In order to evaluate the potential of MIBK to induce toxic and carcinogenic effects following chronic exposure, groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to MIBK at concentrations of 0, 450, 900, or 1800ppm by inhalation, 6h/day, 5 days per week for 2 years. Survival was decreased in male rats at 1800ppm. Body weight gains were decreased in male rats at 900 and 1800ppm and in female mice at 1800ppm. The primary targets of MIBK toxicity and carcinogenicity were the kidney in rats and the liver in mice. In male rats, there was increased mineralization of the renal papilla at all exposure concentrations. The incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) was increased at 1800ppm and the severity was increased in all exposed groups. There were also increases in renal tubule hyperplasia at all exposure concentrations, and in adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) at 1800ppm; these lesions are thought to represent a continuum in the progression of proliferative lesions in renal tubule epithelium. These increases may have resulted from the increased severity of CPN, either through alpha2micro-globulin-dependent or -independent mechanisms. An increase in mononuclear cell leukemia at 1800ppm was an uncertain finding. Adrenal medulla hyperplasia was increased at 1800ppm, and there was a positive trend for increases in benign or malignant pheochromocytomas (combined). In female rats, there were increases in the incidence of CPN in all exposure concentrations and in the severity at 1800ppm, indicating that CPN was increased by mechanisms in addition to those related to alpha2micro-globulin. There were renal mesenchymal tumors, which have not been observed in historical control animals, in two female rats at 1800ppm. The relationship of these tumors to exposure to MIBK was uncertain. Hepatocellular adenomas, and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were increased in male and female mice exposed to 1800ppm.

To investigate the antiallergic effect of virgin olive oil samples from five principal olive varieties grown in various regions of Tunisia, we used the type I allergy reaction model using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells and different dilutions of olive oil samples to determine beta-hexosaminidase release inhibition at two different response stages. Results showed that the Sayali olive oil significantly inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release by the IgE antibody-sensitized, BSA antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells at the antibody-antigen binding stage. The result of our experiment shows that the anti-allergic effect of olive oil at this binding stage may be dependent on their flavone content. The Zarrazi olive oil significantly inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release at the antigen-receptor binding stage. Moreover, we investigated the effect of olive oil samples on histamine release and production of cytokines by activated human basophilic (KU812) cells. Different dilutions of Sayali olive oil dose-dependently inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), and different dilutions of Zarrazi olive oil dose-dependently inhibited histamine release and IL-4 production by calcium ionophore A23187 plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated KU812 cells.","['Yamada, P', 'Zarrouk, M', 'Kawasaki, K', 'Isoda, H']","['Yamada P', 'Zarrouk M', 'Kawasaki K', 'Isoda H']","['Alliance for Research on North Africa (ARENA), Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8572, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Olive Oil)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Freeze Fracturing', 'Histamine Release', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-8741(07)00632-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2007.11.028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2008 Mar 5;116(2):279-87. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2007.11.028.

Herein, we examine whether it functions during macrophage-like differentiation. Previous studies reveal that ODC, a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, and polyamines are involved in restraining immune response in activated macrophage. By using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-differentiated human promyelocytic HL-60 and promonocytic U-937 cells, we discover that polyamines block the expression, secretion and activation of MMP-9. Meanwhile conventional expression of ODC represses tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation as well as MMP-9 enzyme activity. Following stimulation by TNF-alpha, the secretion of MMP-9 is restored in ODC-overexpressed cells. In addition, the NF-kappaB inhibitors (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, BAY-11-7082 and lactacystin) suppress the TPA-induced MMP-9 enzyme activity. Concurrently, both the irreversible inhibitor of ODC, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, and TNF-alpha could not recover MMP-9 activation following NF-kappaB inhibitor treatment in parental cells. Furthermore, ODC could directly inhibit and attenuate NF-kappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Therefore, we suggest that ODC inhibits the TNF-alpha-elevated MMP-9 activation via NF-kappaB as TPA-induced macrophage-like differentiation and this interrupting mechanism may provide a new conceivable resolution why leukemia is poorly differentiated besides atypical growth.","['Liao, Ya-Fan', 'Hung, Hui-Chih', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Kao, Ming-Ching', 'Hour, Tzyh-Chyuan', 'Tsay, Gregory J', 'Liu, Guang-Yaw']","['Liao YF', 'Hung HC', 'Hsu PC', 'Kao MC', 'Hour TC', 'Tsay GJ', 'Liu GY']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080104,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00446-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jul;32(7):1124-40. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.019.

As a result, most patients develop severe hypogammaglobulinemia during the course of the disease. Fourteen patients were analyzed retrospectively for changes in globulins produced by antineoplastic treatments. During maximum response to fludarabine, chlorambucil, and overall rituximab, the mean levels of globulins were 2.500, 2.752, and 3.018 g/dl. The mean increase in globulins during clinical response to individual treatments compared to pre-treatment values were 0.050 g/dl for fludarabine, 0.302 g/dl for chlorambucil, 0.267 g/dl for low-dose rituximab, and 0.346 g/dl for high-dose rituximab. Overall, treatment with rituximab produced an average increase in globulins at clinical response of 11.6%, which increased further to 17.3% at maximum clinical response. Serum globulins increased significantly compared with pre-treatment values at maximum clinical response to rituximab overall (P=0.001) and high-dose rituximab (P=0.001), but no statistical significance occurred in the cases of fludarabine (P=0.5), chlorambucil/prednisone (P=0.14), and low-dose rituximab (P=0.07). Serum globulins levels correlate with disease status (complete responders versus partial responders and stable disease groups), but not with peripheral neoplastic load. Therefore, although rituximab is efficient in decreasing the tumor burden, additional mechanisms may be involved in relieving suppressive effects on immunoglobulin-producing cells, which especially manifest at high doses of the agent. Use of high doses of rituximab in CLL can avoid T-cell dysfunction and neutropenia, and is associated with humoral immunorestorative effects.","['Alexandrescu, Doru T', 'Wiernik, Peter H']","['Alexandrescu DT', 'Wiernik PH']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, New York Medical College, 600 East 233rd Street, Bronx, NY 10466, USA. mddoru@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080105,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Serum Globulins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/drug therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Serum Globulins/*analysis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12032-007-9037-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2008;25(3):309-14. doi: 10.1007/s12032-007-9037-8.

Indications for transplant and outcomes of previous clinical studies, and novel transplant strategies designed to improve safety and efficacy of the procedure are reviewed.","['Shenoy, S', 'Smith, F O']","['Shenoy S', 'Smith FO']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis Children's Hospital, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. shenoy@wustl.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080107,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705961 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705961 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jan;41(2):141-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705961.

High-risk was defined by (1) AML secondary to MDS or radio/chemotherapy, (2) unfavorable cytogenetics or (3) delayed response to induction chemotherapy. A total of 23 of 44 AML patients referred to the University of Munich for alloSCT in CR1 between 1999 and 2006 fulfilled these criteria and received FLAMSA chemotherapy, followed by RIC (4 Gy TBI/cyclophosphamide/ATG) for alloSCT. Twenty-two patients engrafted, one died in aplasia. Two-year cumulative incidences for relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 4.6 and 22.5%, respectively. Four-year overall and leukemia-free survival was 72.7% (median follow-up among survivors: 35 months). The results of this high-risk cohort were compared to the outcome of 21 consecutive standard-risk patients <55 years, who had received standard, myeloablative sibling SCT in CR1 AML within the same center and time period. Survival and cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were identical in both groups. In conclusion, the FLAMSA-RIC regimen produces long-term remission in a high proportion of patients with high-risk AML transplanted in CR1. In this cohort, FLAMSA-RIC showed equivalent antileukemic activity as compared to the standard protocols.","['Schmid, C', 'Schleuning, M', 'Hentrich, M', 'Markl, G E', 'Gerbitz, A', 'Tischer, J', 'Ledderose, G', 'Oruzio, D', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Kolb, H-J']","['Schmid C', 'Schleuning M', 'Hentrich M', 'Markl GE', 'Gerbitz A', 'Tischer J', 'Ledderose G', 'Oruzio D', 'Hiddemann W', 'Kolb HJ']","['Clinical Cooperative Group Hematopoietic Transplantation, Jose-Carreras Unit for Hematopoietic Transplantation, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.

Some centres have focused on the conditioning regimens and post transplant immune suppression; others have concentrated on manipulating the graft. Haploidentical transplant modalities are based mainly on high-intensity conditioning regimen, but reduced intensity regimens have recently been introduced. The graft may be a megadose of extensively T cell-depleted or unmanipulated progenitor cells. Excellent engraftment rates are associated with a very low incidence of GVHD- and regimen-related mortality even in patients who are over 50 years old. Overall, event-free survival and transplant-related mortality compare favourably with reports on transplants from sources of stem cells other than the matched sibling.

Expected median survival for such patients with conventional therapy is only 1-4 years. As a result of such dismal prognosis, alternative strategies based on autologous and allogeneic transplantation have been explored, and a relatively small number of case reports and small series communicated to date have provided evidence for the potential role of haematopoietic transplantation in these patients. High-dose radio-chemotherapy and autologous rescue has been shown to induce complete responses in the majority of patients. Disappointingly though, these responses were very short-lived in nearly all cases. On the contrary, the use of allogeneic transplantation has provided solid evidence for an allogeneic GVL effect in these malignancies. In fact, more than two-thirds of the allogeneic transplant recipients reported in the literature experienced long-term durable remissions of more than 3 years, which would appear superior to the expected median survival for such patients. This review summarizes the experience published to date in this setting and highlights main areas that would merit further investigation.","['Duarte, R F', 'Schmitz, N', 'Servitje, O', 'Sureda, A']","['Duarte RF', 'Schmitz N', 'Servitje O', 'Sureda A']","[""Department of Haematology, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Duran i Reynals, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain. rduarte@iconcologia.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080107,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705968 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705968 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Apr;41(7):597-604. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705968.

This study examined endothelial function in 75 young (age 30.2+/-7.1 y) adult survivors of childhood ALL who received chemotherapy without cranial radiation (n=25) or chemotherapy combined with cranial radiation (n=50) compared with a healthy control group of similar sex, age, and weight (n=59). PROCEDURE: As part of a clinical follow-up study, endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD: % change in artery diameter after 5 min of occlusion) was assessed using high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery. Fifteen minutes after the measurement of FMD, sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) was administered and the brachial artery was imaged using ultrasound to assess endothelial-independent dilation (EID). All ultrasound imaging data were adjusted for baseline diameter. RESULTS: The healthy comparison group had a significantly greater FMD response (9.5%+/-2.9%) than both the chemotherapy only (6.5%+/-2.6%) and chemotherapy combined with radiation (7.1%+/-2.6%) groups. No statistical differences were observed in nitrate-mediated EID between the healthy comparison group (27.0%+/-5.0%) and the chemotherapy only (24.7%+/-6.7%) or chemotherapy combined with radiation (25.2%+/-7.1%) groups. Among the ALL survivors, female subjects had a significantly greater FMD and nitrate-mediated EID than male subjects even after correcting for baseline brachial artery diameter. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that young adults treated for ALL during childhood are at risk for impaired FMD regardless of whether or not they received cranial irradiation. The extent to which this mechanism relates to early development of cardiovascular disease in long-term childhood ALL survivors remains to be determined.","['Dengel, Donald R', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Glasser, Stephen P', 'Williamson, Eric B', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Gurney, James G']","['Dengel DR', 'Ness KK', 'Glasser SP', 'Williamson EB', 'Baker KS', 'Gurney JG']","['School of Kinesiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Vasodilator Agents)', 'G59M7S0WS3 (Nitroglycerin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Brachial Artery/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Endothelium, Vascular/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nitroglycerin/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vasodilation/*drug effects', 'Vasodilator Agents/*administration & dosage']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/03/19 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318159a593 [doi]', '00043426-200801000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jan;30(1):20-5. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318159a593.,,,"['M01-RR00400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA106778/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that, in Jurkat cells, strong fluorescence density of NPM prevails in the nucleus, while, some key nucleoporins: Nup88 and Nup214 localize mainly in the cytoplasm. Deguelin, a natural occurring rotenoid, presents powerful anti-leukemia effects through proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction in Jurkat cells. Deguelin downregulates the expression of NPM, Nup88 and Nup214 in a dose-dependent manner and reverts the localization of Nup88 and Nup214 to nuclear rim.

We examined the possible involvement of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)s (cPLA(2)s) in the production of CE through the reesterification and in the formation of foam cells. In [(3)H]oleic acid-labeled human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell-derived macrophages (THP-M) and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM), which possessed at least cPLA(2)alpha and cPLA(2)gamma, stimulation with OxLDL induced the production of [(3)H]cholesteryl oleate ([(3)H]CE).The production was suppressed by an inhibitor of cPLA(2)s. However, the inhibitor tended to slightly decrease total intracellular levels of CE, and did not affect the formation of foam cells, as estimated by staining with Oil Red O. In cPLA(2)alpha-knockout MPM, OxLDL-induced increases in [(3)H]CE and total CE did not differ from those in wild-type MPM. Our results suggest that cPLA(2)s other than cPLA(2)alpha contribute to the supply of fatty acids, which are utilized for the production of CE through the reesterification, in OxLDL-stimulated macrophages. However, the formation of foam cells could not be inhibited only by the suppression of cPLA(2)-mediated CE production.","['Ii, Hiromi', 'Oka, Mayuko', 'Yamashita, Atsushi', 'Waku, Keizo', 'Uozumi, Naonori', 'Shimizu, Takao', 'Sato, Takashi', 'Akiba, Satoshi']","['Ii H', 'Oka M', 'Yamashita A', 'Waku K', 'Uozumi N', 'Shimizu T', 'Sato T', 'Akiba S']","['Department of Pathological Biochemistry, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Misasagi, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto 607-8414, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Phospholipase A2 Inhibitors)', '0 (methyl arachidonylfluorophosphonate)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol Esters/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Foam Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Organophosphonates/*pharmacology', '*Phospholipase A2 Inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2008/01/08 09:00,2008/02/07 09:00,['2008/01/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/31.6 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.31.6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2008 Jan;31(1):6-12. doi: 10.1248/bpb.31.6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase activity was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while apoptosis was measured at the single-cell level by fluorescence in situ detection using flow cytometry in 15 control subjects and 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients at presentation. Telomerase activity in ALL patients was negatively correlated to apoptosis [percent and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)] (p < 0.001 for percent and p < 0.001 for MFI) and to the 4-year survival rate (p < 0.05), to which apoptosis (percent and MFI) was consequently positively correlated (p < 0.001 for percent and p < 0.05 for MFI). For telomerase, the highest positive predictive value (PPV) for mortality (93.3%) was at a cut-off value of 13 amol/ml, while those for apoptosis (85% for percent of apoptotic cells and 90.9% for MFI) were at a cut-off of 8% and 0.19 MFI.

As molecular mechanisms and characteristics of the disease become clearer, they represent potential targets for therapy. One such mechanism is the process of farnesylation, which is required for the activation of RAS proteins and potentially other deranged pathways. The first farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) to undergo assessment in AML is tipifarnib, which has achieved a complete remission in 4% of patients who have relapsed and in 15% of untreated elderly patients.

The role that xenobiotics individually or in mixtures, and at environmental concentrations, play in the etiology of common human diseases often remains obscure. METHODS: In the presence or absence of lindane, chromosomal aberrations were detected in MCF-7 cells after 24-hr treatment with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) or 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Micronuclei were scored in 1,000 binucleate cells/treatment. We investigated intracellular responses using quantitative gene expression analyses of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A [CDKN1A (P21(WAF1/CIP1))], B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), BCL-2-associated X (BAX), and isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1. Immunocytochemical analyses of p53, p21(Waf1/Cip1), Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression in MCF-7 cells were also carried out. RESULTS: After exposure to binary mixtures of B[a]P plus lindane or PhIP plus lindane, a 10-fold increase in micronucleus formation resulted; these test agents individually induced 2- to 5-fold increases. Lindane increased the ratio of Bcl-2:Bax, as did 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). Although treatment with B[a]P alone was found to elevate expression of P21(WAF1/CIP1)and CYP isoenzymes, it reduced the ratio of BCL-2:BAX mRNA transcripts. Treatment with a binary mixture of 10(-8) M B[a]P plus 10(-12) M lindane or 10(-10) M E(2) reversed B[a]P-induced reductions in the ratio of Bcl-2- to Bax-positive cells. In contrast, treatments with PhIP (known to possess hormonelike properties) plus lindane or E(2) resulted in profound reductions in Bcl-2:Bax ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low-dose treatments (i.e., close to environmental levels) may increase DNA damage while influencing survival in exposed cells and that these effects may depend on the endocrine activity of test agents.","['Hewitt, Rebecca', 'Forero, Albert', 'Luncsford, Paz J', 'Martin, Francis L']","['Hewitt R', 'Forero A', 'Luncsford PJ', 'Martin FL']","['Biomedical Sciences Unit, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '59NEE7PCAB (Hexachlorocyclohexane)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '909C6UN66T (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine)']",IM,"['Benzo(a)pyrene/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'Estradiol/toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hexachlorocyclohexane/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*toxicity', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Xenobiotics/toxicity', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2008/01/05 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2008/01/05 09:00'],"['2006/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.9361 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Dec;115 Suppl 1:129-36. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9361.,,PMC2174410,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['17beta-estradiol', 'BAX', 'Bcl-2', 'PhIP', 'benzo[a]pyrene', 'binary mixture', 'clonogenic assay', 'cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay', 'lindane', 'micronucleus']",,,,,,,,

He was examined at the Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Social Insurance Hospital in August 2003. The treatment was switched from GST to salazosulfapyridine (SASP), with improvement of the polyarthritis. Subsequently, in March 2005, the patient developed fever, pancytopenia and liver dysfunction, and was admitted to Saitama Social Insurance Hospital. Since these abnormalities were suspected to be caused by SASP, this drug was stopped and prednisolone (PSL) was started at 10 mg/day. However, since the fever, pancytopenia and liver dysfunction persisted, bone marrow examination was performed and the patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B cell type, L2). He was transferred to the Division of Hematology, Omiya Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, on 8(th) April, 2005 for induction chemotherapy. Although the induction therapy needed to be stopped because the patient developed dysphagia and biliary system dysfunction, complete remission (CR) was confirmed. It was difficult to restart chemotherapy in the patient because his general condition remained poor, with repeated episodes of aspiration pneumonia and newly detected stomach cancer. He was, therefore, transferred back to Saitama Social Insurance Hospital on 28(th) September, 2005. The ALL remained in CR and the RA activity had disappeared without therapy, but the patient died of pneumonia on 1(st) August, 2006.","['Sekiguchi, Yasunobu', 'Mori, Shigehisa', 'Aoki, Kazutoshi', 'Higuchi, Takakazu', 'Nishida, Jyunji']","['Sekiguchi Y', 'Mori S', 'Aoki K', 'Higuchi T', 'Nishida J']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical Center.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Nihon Rinsho Meneki Gakkai Kaishi,Nihon Rinsho Men'eki Gakkai kaishi = Japanese journal of clinical immunology,9505992,,IM,"['Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",2008/01/05 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2008/01/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jsci/30.461 [pii]', '10.2177/jsci.30.461 [doi]']",ppublish,Nihon Rinsho Meneki Gakkai Kaishi. 2007 Dec;30(6):461-6. doi: 10.2177/jsci.30.461.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we evaluated the effects of CD4(+)CD25(+)forkhead box P3(+) Tregs isolated from mice bearing 12B1 bcr-abl(+) leukemia on DC and macrophages that had been activated by 12B1-derived CRCL. CRCL-activated DC and macrophages resisted Treg suppression, as the production of proinflammatory cytokines, the activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB, and their immunostimulatory potential was unaffected by Tregs.

Here, we showed that lack of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim)(EL) protein expression, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family proteins, conferred resistance of a T-ALL cell line, Sup-T1, to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bim(EL) significantly restored its sensitivity to etoposide-induced caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Surprisingly, we found that constitutive activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in Sup-T1 cells promoted phosphorylation and degradation of Bim(EL) via the proteosome. Blocking with a proteosome inhibitor yielded an elevated level of Bim(EL) and accumulation of Bim(EL) species phosphorylated at Ser(69). Pretreatment of Sup-T1 cells with a specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, also increased the Bim(EL) level and resensitized the cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Together, our findings suggest that the JNK activation status may correlate with the Bim(EL) level and in turn can control the sensitivity of T-ALL cells to chemotherapeutic agents.","['Leung, Kam Tong', 'Li, Karen Kwai-Har', 'Sun, Samuel Sai-Ming', 'Chan, Paul Kay Sheung', 'Ooi, Vincent Eng-Choon', 'Chiu, Lawrence Chi-Ming']","['Leung KT', 'Li KK', 'Sun SS', 'Chan PK', 'Ooi VE', 'Chiu LC']","['Department of Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080103,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/01/05 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgm294 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgm294 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2008 Mar;29(3):544-51. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgm294.

Here we present newly designed cytokine traps for murine and human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as prototypes for inhibitors targeting cytokines that signal through a heterodimer of two signaling receptors of the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) family. LIF signals through a receptor heterodimer of LIF receptor (LIFR) and gp130 and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 leading to target gene expression. The analysis of various receptor fusion and deletion constructs revealed that a truncated form of the murine LIF receptor consisting of the first five extracellular domains was a potent inhibitor for human LIF. For the efficient inhibition of murine LIF, the cytokine-binding module of murine gp130 had to be fused to the first five domains of murine LIFR generating mLIF-RFP (murine LIFR fusion protein). The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and subsequent gene induction induced by human or murine LIF are completely blocked by the respective inhibitor. Furthermore, both inhibitors are specific and do not alter the bioactivities of the closely related cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and oncostatin M. The gained knowledge on the construction of LIF inhibitors can be transferred to the design of inhibitors for related cytokines such as IL-31, IL-27, and oncostatin M for the treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases.","['Metz, Silke', 'Naeth, Gudrun', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Muller-Newen, Gerhard']","['Metz S', 'Naeth G', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Universitatsklinikum RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080103,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/05 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/01/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)57174-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M706610200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Mar 7;283(10):5985-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706610200.

This study analysed the expression of 154 human miRNAs in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and control samples using a stem-loop real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction approach. Global patterns of miRNA expression in AML, normal bone marrow (NBM) and CD34(+) progenitor cells allowed correct class predictions similar to whole genome microarray expression analyses that were performed at the same time. At single miRNA species level, MIRN23B was repressed in AML specimens compared to NBM and purified CD34(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells. In contrast, the MIRN221/MIRN222 cluster and MIRN34A were expressed at significantly higher levels in AML blasts. Patients with high MIRN221/MIRN222 expression showed low levels of KIT RNA and protein expression but the correlation between kit protein and KIT mRNA was significantly stronger than the correlation of either one with MIRN221/MIRN222. A global analysis between miRNA expression levels and mRNA expression of predicted target genes revealed only weak associations in the majority of miRNA species. Nonetheless, the presence of two or more miRNA binding sites within the mRNA was usually associated with a decrease in mRNA levels.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated six patients with imatinib-resistant CML in haematological relapse (leukocytes > 20,000 microL(-1)) with rapamycin at 2 mg per os daily for 14 consecutive days, with dose-adjustment allowed to reach a target rapamycin serum concentration of 10-20 pg mL(-1). RESULTS: A major leukocyte response with decrease to less than 10,000 microL(-1) was obtained in two patients, and a minor transient response was seen in two other patients. In responding patients, we also observed a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA levels in circulating leukaemic cells. Side effects during rapamycin treatment were mild in most patients. In one patient, pneumonia developed. Rapamycin was also found to counteract growth of CML cells in vitro as determined by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Moreover, rapamycin inhibited the growth of Ba/F3 cells exhibiting various imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL, including the T315I variant that exhibits resistance against most currently available BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin shows antileukaemic effects in imatinib-resistant CML in vitro and in vivo. Larger trials with rapamycin or rapamycin-derivatives in combination with other targeted drugs are warranted to further determine clinical efficacy in CML.","['Sillaber, C', 'Mayerhofer, M', 'Bohm, A', 'Vales, A', 'Gruze, A', 'Aichberger, K J', 'Esterbauer, H', 'Pfeilstocker, M', 'Sperr, W R', 'Pickl, W F', 'Haas, O A', 'Valent, P']","['Sillaber C', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Bohm A', 'Vales A', 'Gruze A', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Esterbauer H', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Sperr WR', 'Pickl WF', 'Haas OA', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2008/01/05 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/01/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['ECI1892 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2007.01892.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2008 Jan;38(1):43-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2007.01892.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the effects of hemin on cellular sensitivity to imatinib and other anti-leukemia reagents. Hemin treatment of human BCR/ABL-positive KCL22 leukemia cells increased IC(50) values of imatinib, that is, the drug resistance, in a dose-dependent manner without any change in the BCR/ABL kinase activity. Imatinib-induced apoptosis was also suppressed by hemin treatment in KCL22 cells. Hemin treatment increased the activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) light subunit gene promoter, which contains a Maf recognition element (MARE). Protein levels of gamma-GCS and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), two MARE-containing genes, were also increased after hemin treatment. Knockdown of Nrf2 expression by RNA interference largely abolished the effect of hemin on imatinib-treated cells, suggesting that Nrf2 recognition of MARE is essential for the hemin-mediated protective effect. Similar to hemin, treatment of cells with delta-aminolevulinic acid (delta-ALA), the obligatory heme precursor, also increased IC(50) values of imatinib. In contrast, inhibition of cellular heme synthesis by succinylacetone increased the sensitivity of cells to imatinib in two imatinib-resistant cell lines, KCL22/SR and KU812/SR. Hemin treatment also decreased the sensitivity of cells to four anthracyclins, daunorubicin, idarubicin, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone, in BCR/ABL-negative leukemia U937 and THP-1 cells, as well as in KCL22 cells. These findings thus indicate that cellular heme level plays an important role in determining the sensitivity of cells to imatinib and certain other anti-leukemia drugs and that the effect of heme may be mediated via its ability to upregulate Nrf2 activity.","['Nagai, Tadashi', 'Kikuchi, Satoru', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Miyoshi, Takuji', 'Nakamura, Makiko', 'Kondo, Takahito', 'Furuyama, Kazumichi', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Nagai T', 'Kikuchi S', 'Ohmine K', 'Miyoshi T', 'Nakamura M', 'Kondo T', 'Furuyama K', 'Komatsu N', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan. t-nagai@jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/01/04 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/01/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21659 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 May 15;104(2):680-91. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21659.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While some autoantibodies may contribute to the pathology seen with SLE, numerous studies have shown that dysregulation of T-cell function is another critical aspect driving disease. The positive results obtained in clinical trials using T-cell- or B-cell-specific treatments have suggested that cooperation between T and B cells probably underlies disease progression in many patients. A similar cooperative mechanism seemed to explain SLE developing in mice overexpressing the B-cell-activating factor from the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF). However, surprisingly, T-cell-deficient BAFF transgenic (Tg) mice develop SLE similar to T-cell-sufficient BAFF Tg mice, and the disease was linked to innate activation of B cells and production of proinflammatory autoantibody isotypes. In conclusion, dysregulated innate activation of B cells alone can drive disease independently of T cells, and as such this aspect represents a new pathogenic mechanism in autoimmunity.","['Groom, Joanna', 'Mackay, Fabienne']","['Groom J', 'Mackay F']","['The Autoimmunity Research Unit, The Garvan Institute of Medical research, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Autoimmunity/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', '*B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Clonal Deletion/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/etiology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Self Tolerance/genetics/immunology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/immunology"", 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2008/01/04 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/01/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['7100142 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.icb.7100142 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2008 Jan;86(1):40-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.icb.7100142.,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been found as a frequent target of aberrancies in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 30% of B cell ALL cases), showing monoallelic loss, point mutations, or chromosomal translocations. The role of these aberrancies is still poorly understood. We previously cloned the PAX5/TEL fusion gene in a patient affected by B-cell precursor ALL with a t(9;12) translocation. This is the first report investigating the molecular and functional roles of PAX5/TEL protein in vitro from murine wild-type pre-BI cells. We showed that PAX5/TEL protein acts as an aberrant transcription factor with repressor function, recruiting mSin3A, down-regulating B220, CD19, BLNK, MB-1, FLT3, and mu heavy chain expression, thus suggesting a block on B-cell differentiation. In a PAX5-deficient context, the presence of PAX5/TEL did not replace PAX5 functions. PAX5/TEL protein enhances cell migration towards CXCL12, with the overexpression of CXCR4. Moreover, the presence of the fusion gene overcomes interleukin-7 withdrawal and interferes with transforming growth factor-beta1 pathway, inducing resistance and conferring cells an advantage in proliferation and survival. Thus, in vitro, the PAX5/TEL protein has a dominant effect on wild-type PAX5, interferes with the process of B-cell differentiation and migration, and induces resistance to apoptosis. Taken together, these phenomena likely represent key events in the process of B-cell transformation.","['Fazio, Grazia', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Rolink, Antonius', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Fazio G', 'Palmi C', 'Rolink A', 'Biondi A', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (PAX5-TEL fusion protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD79 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chemokine CXCL12/immunology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/01/04 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2008/01/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/1/181 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2778 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 1;68(1):181-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2778.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate FCM as frontline therapy in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty-nine patients under the age of 65 years with active CLL were treated. Patients received six cycles of fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) i.v. x 3 days, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) i.v. x 3 days, and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m(2) i.v. x 1 day. Treatment outcome was correlated with clinical and biological variables. The clinical significance of eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) was also analyzed. RESULTS: The overall response, MRD-negative complete response (CR), MRD-positive CR, nodular partial response (PR), and PR rates were 90%, 26%, 38%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. Severe (grades 3 or 4) neutropenia developed in 10% of the patients. Major and minor infections were reported in 1% and 8% of cases, respectively. Median response duration was 37 months. Patients with del(17p) failed to attain CR. Patients achieving MRD-negative CR had a longer response duration and overall survival than patients with an inferior response. Low serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, low ZAP-70 expression, and mutated IgV(H) genes predicted longer response duration. Finally, both low ZAP-70 and CD38 expression in leukemic cells correlated with MRD-negativity achievement. CONCLUSION: FCM induces a high response rate, including MRD-negative CRs in untreated patients with active CLL. Treatment toxicity is acceptable. Both high ZAP-70 and increased CD38 expression predict failure to obtain MRD-negative response. Patients in whom MRD can be eradicated have longer response duration and overall survival than those with inferior response. These results indicate that FCM can be an ideal companion for chemoimmunotherapy of patients with CLL.","['Bosch, Francesc', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Briones, Javier', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Gardella, Santiago', 'Escoda, Lourdes', 'Perez-Ceballos, Elena', 'Asensi, Antoni', 'Sayas, Ma Jose', 'Font, Llorenc', 'Altes, Albert', 'Muntanola, Ana', 'Bertazzoni, Paola', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Gine, Eva', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Bosch F', 'Ferrer A', 'Villamor N', 'Gonzalez M', 'Briones J', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Abella E', 'Gardella S', 'Escoda L', 'Perez-Ceballos E', 'Asensi A', 'Sayas MJ', 'Font L', 'Altes A', 'Muntanola A', 'Bertazzoni P', 'Rozman M', 'Aymerich M', 'Gine E', 'Montserrat E']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. fbosch@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis']",2008/01/04 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/1/155 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1371 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 1;14(1):155-61. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1371.,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 1;14(13):4353.

It has been suggested that the SET domain containing protein RE-IIBP (interleukin-5 [IL-5] response element II binding protein) may perform a function in the carcinogenesis of certain tumor types, including myeloma. However, the pathogenic role of RE-IIBP in these diseases remains to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we have conducted an investigation into the relationship between the histone-methylating activity of RE-IIBP and transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that RE-IIBP is up-regulated in the blood cells of leukemia patients, and we characterized the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3-K27) methyltransferase activity of RE-IIBP. Point mutant analysis revealed that SET domain cysteine 483 and arginine 477 are critical residues for the histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity of RE-IIBP. RE-IIBP also represses basal transcription via histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruitment, which may be mediated by H3-K27 methylation. In the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that RE-IIBP overexpression induces histone H3-K27 methylation, HDAC recruitment, and histone H3 hypoacetylation on the IL-5 promoter and represses expression. Conversely, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of RE-IIBP reduces histone H3-K27 methylation and HDAC occupancy around the IL-5 promoter.

Patients with NF1 have a higher risk to develop juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) with a possible progression toward acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In an oligo array comparative genomic hybridization-based screening of 103 patients with pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and 71 patients with MLL-rearranged AML, a recurrent cryptic deletion, del(17)(q11.2), was identified in 3 patients with T-ALL and 2 patients with MLL-rearranged AML. This deletion has previously been described as a microdeletion of the NF1 region in patients with NF1. However, our patients lacked clinical NF1 symptoms. Mutation analysis in 4 of these del(17)(q11.2)-positive patients revealed that mutations in the remaining NF1 allele were present in 3 patients, confirming its role as a tumor-suppressor gene in cancer. In addition, NF1 inactivation was confirmed at the RNA expression level in 3 patients tested. Since the NF1 protein is a negative regulator of the RAS pathway (RAS-GTPase activating protein), homozygous NF1 inactivation represent a novel type I mutation in pediatric MLL-rearranged AML and T-ALL with a predicted frequency that is less than 10%. NF1 inactivation may provide an additional proliferative signal toward the development of leukemia.","['Balgobind, Brian V', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'van den Ouweland, Ans M W', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Terlouw-Kromosoeto, Joan N R', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Meijerink, Jules P P']","['Balgobind BV', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'van den Ouweland AM', 'Beverloo HB', 'Terlouw-Kromosoeto JN', 'van Wering ER', 'Reinhardt D', 'Horstmann M', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Pieters R', 'Zwaan CM', 'Van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Meijerink JP']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC / Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080102,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neurofibromatoses/*genetics', 'Neurofibromin 1/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",2008/01/04 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/01/04 09:00'],"['2008/01/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)40895-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-095075 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 15;111(8):4322-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-095075.

Patients received 2 cycles of intravenous cytarabine (200 mg/m(2) or 1000 mg/m(2) days 1-7) in conjunction with imatinib (200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg), according to predefined, successive dose levels. All dose levels proved feasible. Seven dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 302 cycles of chemotherapy, which were caused by streptococcal bacteremia in 5 cases. Intermediate-dose cytarabine (1000 mg/m(2)) prolonged time to neutrophil recovery and platelet recovery compared with a standard dose (200 mg/m(2)). High-dose imatinib (600 mg or 800 mg) extended the time to platelet recovery compared with a standard dose (400 mg). More infectious complications common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4 were observed after intermediate-dose cytarabine compared with a standard-dose of cytarabine. Early response data after combination therapy included a complete cytogenetic response in 48% and a major molecular response in 30% of patients, which increased to 46% major molecular responses at 1 year, including 13% complete molecular responses.

However, recent studies have revealed that tamoxifen induces apoptosis even in estrogen receptor-negative cells. In the present study, we synthesized several tamoxifen derivatives to augment the apoptosis-inducing effect of tamoxifen and evaluated the apoptosis-inducing pathway. The estrogen receptor-positive human leukemia cell line HL-60 and estrogen receptor-negative human leukemia cell line Jurkat were treated with tamoxifen and synthesized tamoxifen derivatives, and thereafter subjected to cell viability-detection assays. Tamoxifen derivatives, as well as the lead compound tamoxifen, decreased the cell viability despite the expression of estrogen receptor. Among all of the synthesized tamoxifen derivatives, ridaifen-B had more potent cancer cell-damaging activity than tamoxifen. Ridaifen-B fragmented Jurkat cell DNA and activated caspases, suggesting that the ridaifen-B-induced apoptosis pathway is estrogen receptor independent. Moreover, mitochondrial involvement during ridaifen-B-induced apoptosis was estimated. Ridaifen-B significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited ridaifen-B-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the induction of apoptosis by ridaifen-B, a novel tamoxifen derivative, is dependent on mitochondrial perturbation without estrogen receptor involvement.","['Nagahara, Yukitoshi', 'Shiina, Isamu', 'Nakata, Kenya', 'Sasaki, Akane', 'Miyamoto, Tomomi', 'Ikekita, Masahiko']","['Nagahara Y', 'Shiina I', 'Nakata K', 'Sasaki A', 'Miyamoto T', 'Ikekita M']","['Department of Biotechnology, College of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Denki University, Hatoyama, Hiki-gun, Saitama, 350-0394, Japan. yunagahara@b.dendai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071219,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (ridaifen-B)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects', 'Tamoxifen/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",2008/01/03 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/01/03 09:00'],"['2008/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS709 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00709.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Mar;99(3):608-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00709.x.

To facilitate the discovery and investigation of anti-leukaemia therapeutics under physiological conditions, we have engineered HL-60 cells that stably express firefly luciferase and produce light that can be detected using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Bioluminescent HL-60luc cells could be rapidly detected in whole blood with a sensitivity of approximately 1000 viable cells/200 microl blood. Treatment of HL-60luc cells with the drug chlorambucil revealed that the bioluminescent viability assay is able to detect cell death earlier than the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. HL-60luc cells administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v.) were visualized in living mice.

METHODS: Patients with Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 0 to 2, stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC patients with resectable or unresectable disease were treated with induction chemotherapy (irinotecan 100 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC 5, and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 days 1 and 22) followed by concomitant chemotherapy (irinotecan, carboplatin, and paclitaxel) and chest radiotherapy (66 Gy for unresectable and 50 Gy for resectable disease) beginning on week 7. The primary objective was to escalate the dose of irinotecan during chemoradiation in sequential cohorts to determine the DLT and MTD of the regimen. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (median age 63 years, 57% male, 41% performance status 0, 30% resectable). Induction chemotherapy was tolerable and active (response rate 26%; stable disease 60%). Eight patients did not receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy because of progressive disease (5), death (1), hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel (1), and withdrawal of consent (1). Twenty-nine patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The concomitant administration of chest radiotherapy with weekly irinotecan, carboplatin, and paclitaxel was not feasible at the first, second, and third dose levels. DLT was failure to achieve recovery to <or= grade 1 absolute neutrophil count by the day of scheduled chemotherapy administration. Dose de-escalation to irinotecan 30 mg/m2, paclitaxel 40 mg/m2 (with omission of carboplatin) delivered on weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 of radiotherapy was the MTD. After induction chemotherapy, partial responses, stable disease, and progressive disease was observed in 26%, 60%, and 14% of patients, respectively. After chemoradiotherapy, partial responses were attained in 16 (55%) patients, whereas 12 patients (41%) attained disease stabilization. Median overall survival was 21 months for the entire cohort. Resectable patients had a median survival of 24 months, whereas unresectable patients had a median survival of 19 months. Differences in overall and progression-free survival rates between resectable and unresectable patients was not statistically significant (p = 0.52 and p = 0.90, respectively). DISCUSSION: Carboplatin, paclitaxel, and irinotecan with concurrent chemoradiotherapy was poorly tolerated as a result of neutropenia. Although dose de-escalation was required for delivery of the regimen, the response rates and survival outcomes were comparable to other similar regimens.","['Choong, Nicholas W', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Haraf, Daniel J', 'Tothy, Peter K', 'Ferguson, Mark K', 'Kasza, Kristen', 'Rudin, Charles M', 'Hoffman, Philip C', 'Krauss, Stuart A', 'Szeto, Livia', 'Mauer, Ann M']","['Choong NW', 'Vokes EE', 'Haraf DJ', 'Tothy PK', 'Ferguson MK', 'Kasza K', 'Rudin CM', 'Hoffman PC', 'Krauss SA', 'Szeto L', 'Mauer AM']","['*Section of Hematology-Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60615, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/01/17 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e31815e8566 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31203-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2008 Jan;3(1):59-67. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e31815e8566.,,PMC3742080,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS476866'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to define scedosporiosis incidence and mortality rate over a 15-year period. Only 5 cases of scedosporiosis were identified, all of them involving patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also reviewed all cases of Scedosporium spp. infections in acute leukemia reported to date in the international literature. The 52 cases analyzed confirmed that acute myeloid leukemia is the category with the highest risk of scedosporiosis. Clinical features of scedosporiosis were extremely variable and closely related to patient immune status. Infection disseminated to multiple sites in a very high percentage of patients and outcome was confirmed to be very poor. In our surveys all patients died, in spite of Amphotericin B compounds or voriconazole administration. Our review of literature found scedosporiosis attributable mortality rate (AMR) to be 77%. In conclusion, scedosporiosis, although extremely rare, represents a big problem for clinicians because of its aggressive clinical presentation and the lack of an effective therapy. New drugs with in vitro activity against Scedosporium spp (voriconazole, posaconazole) should be considered. However, their clinical activity should be more widely demonstrated.","['Caira, Morena', 'Girmenia, Corrado', 'Valentini, Caterina Giovanna', 'Sanguinetti, Maurizio', 'Bonini, Alessandro', 'Rossi, Giovanni', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Caira M', 'Girmenia C', 'Valentini CG', 'Sanguinetti M', 'Bonini A', 'Rossi G', 'Fianchi L', 'Leone G', 'Pagano L']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito, I-00168 Rome, Italy. morenacaira@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycetoma/*complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology/mortality', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scedosporium/*metabolism', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['93/1/104 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11740 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jan;93(1):104-10. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11740.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary tumoral chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from 25 patients were investigated for histone H1.2 cytosolic release after treatment with genotoxic (fludarabine, mitoxantrone, etoposide, or X-ray radiation) and non-genotoxic (dexamethasone) agents. Cases were analyzed for the presence of poor-risk genetic alterations, particularly deletions at 17p13 and 11q22. Histone H1.2 release was correlated with the presence of genetic abnormalities and with the best clinical response obtained with standard treatments. RESULTS: DNA-damaging agents induced H1.2 release in a p53-dependent manner which was confirmed by the lack of H1.2 release in p53-deleted cases. Non-DNA-damaging agents induced release of H1.2 in both p53-deleted and non-deleted chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases. Moreover, nuclear H1.2 release was observed after genotoxic and non-genotoxic treatment independently of ATM function. From a clinical standpoint, the lack of histone H1.2 release correlated with resistance to genotoxic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, histone H1.2 traffic was dependent on the p53-status after genotoxic treatment, but could also be induced after treatments that acted independently of p53. By contrast, histone H1.2 release did not seem to be dependent on ATM function. Nuclear histone H1.2 release appears to be an important element in apoptosis induction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, particularly in cases with abnormal p53 function resistant to conventional treatment.","['Gine, Eva', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Muntanola, Ana', 'Calpe, Eva', 'Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Gine E', 'Crespo M', 'Muntanola A', 'Calpe E', 'Baptista MJ', 'Villamor N', 'Montserrat E', 'Bosch F']","[""Department of Hematology, Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['93/1/75 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11546 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jan;93(1):75-82. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11546.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was: (i) to analyze the incidence and outcome of TLS in a large series of patients with AML receiving hyperhydration and allopurinol, (ii) to identify risk factors for TLS, and (iii) to develop a prognostic scoring system for estimating individual risk of TLS. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 772 adult patients with AML receiving induction chemotherapy between 1980 and 2002. TLS was divided into laboratory TLS (LTLS) or clinical TLS (CTLS). The population study was randomly divided into training and test subsets, so that a prognostic model for CTLS was developed in one set and validated in the other. RESULTS: Overall, 130 patients (17%) developed TLS (5% CTLS and 12% LTLS). Unlike LTLS, CTLS was associated with a higher rate of death from induction therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels above laboratory normal values, creatinine >1.4 mg/dL, uric acid >7.5 mg/dL and white blood cell (WBC) counts >25 x 10(9)/L were independent risk factors for CTLS and LTLS. The scoring system, based on pretreatment WBC counts, and uric acid and LDH serum levels, had excellent discrimination and was accurate for predicting CTLS and LTLS. CONCLUSIONS: TLS is frequently observed in AML patients during induction therapy. Only the development of CTLS had an impact on higher mortality rate from induction therapy. The scoring system derived from this study can be used to obtain an accurate estimate of the individual risk of TLS, allowing for risk-adapted prophylaxis against this complication.","['Montesinos, Pau', 'Lorenzo, Ignacio', 'Martin, Guillermo', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Perez-Sirvent, Maria Luz', 'Martinez, David', 'Orti, Guillermo', 'Algarra, Lorenzo', 'Martinez, Jesus', 'Moscardo, Federico', 'de la Rubia, Javier', 'Jarque, Isidro', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Montesinos P', 'Lorenzo I', 'Martin G', 'Sanz J', 'Perez-Sirvent ML', 'Martinez D', 'Orti G', 'Algarra L', 'Martinez J', 'Moscardo F', 'de la Rubia J', 'Jarque I', 'Sanz G', 'Sanz MA']","['Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avenida Campanar 21, 46019, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*complications/*diagnosis/*mortality']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['93/1/67 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11575 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jan;93(1):67-74. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11575.,,,,,['Haematologica. 2008 Jan;93(1):9-13.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an immnunophenotypically heterogeneous group of diseases, with CD34(+) cases being associated with drug resistance and poor outcome. We investigated the effects of bortezomib on the growth and survival of AML cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the in vitro activity and mechanism of action of bortezomib on both cell lines and fresh cells from 28 AML patients including CD34(+) and CD34(-) cases. RESULTS: Bortezomib showed potent anti-AML activity (IC(50) < 50 nM), which was greater than that of conventional agents (doxorubicin, cytarabine and fludarabine). Moreover, synergistic effects were observed when bortezomib was administered in combination with doxorubicin and cytarabine. Mechanistically, bortezomib induced accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phase, with up-regulation of p27, together with cell death through an increase in the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability involving caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. The apoptotic activity of bortezomib on fresh CD34(+) blast cells from patients was similar to that observed on CD34(-)blast cells. Importantly, bortezomib was significantly more active than doxorubicin in the immature CD34(+) cells, while there were no differences in its action on CD34(-) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. Whether this drug might be useful in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia can be established only in ad hoc clinical trials.","['Colado, Enrique', 'Alvarez-Fernandez, Stela', 'Maiso, Patricia', 'Martin-Sanchez, Jesus', 'Vidriales, Maria Belen', 'Garayoa, Mercedes', 'Ocio, Enrique M', 'Montero, Juan Carlos', 'Pandiella, Atanasio', 'San Miguel, Jesus F']","['Colado E', 'Alvarez-Fernandez S', 'Maiso P', 'Martin-Sanchez J', 'Vidriales MB', 'Garayoa M', 'Ocio EM', 'Montero JC', 'Pandiella A', 'San Miguel JF']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['93/1/57 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11666 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Jan;93(1):57-66. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11666.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report an unusual case of a patient presenting with peripheral basophilia and systemic mastocytosis in whom cytogenetic analysis revealed a t(4;5)(q21.1;q31.3). DESIGN AND METHODS: We used molecular analyses to determine the role of PDGFRB in this case. The patient was treated with imatinib. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) documented a breakpoint in PDGFRB. In agreement with this, the patient responded very well to imatinib with resolution of clinical symptoms, basophilia, and mast cell disease. Molecular analyses revealed that PDGFRB, encoding an imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinase, was fused to PRKG2. The fusion gene incorporates the first two exons of PRKG2 fused to the truncated exon 12 of PDGFRB, resulting in the disruption of its juxtamembrane domain. Functional studies confirmed that the activity and transforming properties of PRKG2-PDGFRbeta were dependent on the disruption of the auto-inhibitory juxtamembrane domain.

For physicians, the worst type of infection is one caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Here, we report a patient with an abnormal increase in multidrug-resistant opportunistic bacteria in the gingiva during hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: A 53-year-old woman receiving HCT for leukemia had an insufficient blood cell count for invasive periodontal treatment before HCT. Even brushing caused difficulties with hemostasis. Therefore, frequent pocket irrigation and local minocycline administration were performed. RESULTS: The multidrug-resistant opportunistic bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected first in phlegm 2 days before HCT, and it was detected in a gingival smear and a blood sample 7 and 11 days after HCT, respectively. The patient developed sepsis on day 11 and died 14 days after HCT. Frequent irrigation and local antibiotic application were ineffective against S. maltophilia on the gingiva. Inflammatory gingiva without scaling and root planing showed bleeding tendency, and this interfered with the eradication of this bacterium. CONCLUSIONS: The gingiva in patients undergoing leukemia treatment acts as sites of proliferation and reservoirs for multidrug-resistant opportunistic bacteria. Severe systemic infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria in such patients with leukemia also may involve the gingiva. To prevent abnormal increases in such bacteria on the gingiva, scaling and/or root planing before chemotherapy, which reduces bleeding on brushing during the neutropenic period caused by chemotherapy, may contribute to infection control in such patients, although it was impossible in this case.","['Soga, Yoshihiko', 'Saito, Takashi', 'Nishimura, Fusanori', 'Ishimaru, Fumihiko', 'Mineshiba, Junji', 'Mineshiba, Fumi', 'Takaya, Hirokazu', 'Sato, Hideaki', 'Kudo, Chieko', 'Kokeguchi, Susumu', 'Fujii, Nobuharu', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Takashiba, Shogo']","['Soga Y', 'Saito T', 'Nishimura F', 'Ishimaru F', 'Mineshiba J', 'Mineshiba F', 'Takaya H', 'Sato H', 'Kudo C', 'Kokeguchi S', 'Fujii N', 'Tanimoto M', 'Takashiba S']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Periodontal Science, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '85H0HZU99M (Povidone-Iodine)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gingival Diseases/*microbiology', 'Gingivitis/drug therapy', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*diagnosis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Minocycline/therapeutic use', 'Opportunistic Infections/*microbiology', 'Periodontitis/drug therapy', 'Povidone-Iodine/therapeutic use', 'Sepsis/microbiology', 'Stenotrophomonas maltophilia/*drug effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1902/jop.2008.070205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontol. 2008 Jan;79(1):181-6. doi: 10.1902/jop.2008.070205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we performed a mutation-based functional analysis of TRIM5alpha-mediated MLV restriction. Our results reveal that changes at tyrosine(336) of human TRIM5alpha, within the variable region 1 of its C-terminal PRYSPRY domain, can expand its activity to B-MLV and to the NB-tropic Moloney MLV. Conversely, we demonstrate that the escape of MLV from restriction by wild-type or mutant forms of huTRIM5alpha can be achieved through interdependent changes at positions 82, 109, 110, and 117 of the viral capsid. Together, our results support a model in which TRIM5alpha-mediated retroviral restriction results from the direct binding of the antiviral PRYSPRY domain to the viral capsid, and can be prevented by interferences exerted by critical residues on either one of these two partners.","['Maillard, Pierre V', 'Reynard, Severine', 'Serhan, Fatima', 'Turelli, Priscilla', 'Trono, Didier']","['Maillard PV', 'Reynard S', 'Serhan F', 'Turelli P', 'Trono D']","['Global Health Institute, School of Life Sciences, Frontiers in Genetics National Center for Competence in Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Capsid/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/immunology/*virology', 'HIV Infections/immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*growth & development/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2008/01/02 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2008/01/02 09:00'],"['2007/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-PLPA-RA-0596 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.ppat.0030200 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2007 Dec 28;3(12):e200. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030200.,,PMC2156100,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY523632', 'GENBANK/AY625000', 'RefSeq/NM_008885']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have monitored and analyzed the cytogenetic and molecular response to IM 400 mg/d in a cohort of 277 late chronic phase (LCP) patients who were resistant or intolerant to interferon-alpha and were observed for 48 to 79 months (median, 72 months). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients (55%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCgR). Seventy-seven percent of them were still in CCgR after 5 years. The rate of response loss did not increase over time. The 6-year progression-free survival and overall survival of these 153 complete cytogenetic responders were 90% and 91%, respectively. Molecular response was less than major in 21%, major in 78%, and complete in one patient only. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that, in LCP the CCgR rate to IM is 50% to 60%, and show that CCgR is stable and is associated with a prolonged survival, even if leukemia continues to be molecularly detectable.","['Palandri, Francesca', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'De Vivo, Antonio', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Liberati, Anna Marina', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Palandri F', 'Iacobucci I', 'Martinelli G', 'Amabile M', 'Poerio A', 'Testoni N', 'Soverini S', 'Castagnetti F', 'De Vivo A', 'Breccia M', 'Specchia G', 'Abruzzese E', 'Martino B', 'Cilloni D', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Liberati AM', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology L. and A.

The calpain-calpastatin system within living cells is in a fragile balance, which depends on both partners. The interdependence of calpain--a protease--and calpastatin--an endogenous inhibitor and at the same time a substrate for this enzyme makes any assessment of actual activity of this enzyme in the cells very difficult. In this work we made an attempt to estimate and compare the activity of calpain in human peripheral blood lymphocytes by assessing the levels of limited proteolysis of calpastatin in these cells by western blot, while at the same time the levels of calpain protein inside these cells was measured by flow cytometry. Our results indicate that it is possible to compare (semi-quantitatively) the activities of calpain in peripheral blood CD4+ and CD19+ lymphocytes from various donors that way. Preliminary results showed that calpain activity is increased in the CD4+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients as compared to control lymphocytes. Extremely high intrinsic activity of calpain was detected in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CD19+) cells. All this confirms the detection of immunoreactive products of calpastatin as a good maker of endogenous calpain activity.","['Mikosik, Anna', 'Zaremba, Anna', 'Puchalska, Zofia', 'Daca, Agnieszka', 'Smolenska, Zaneta', 'Lopatniuk, Paulina', 'Mital, Andrzej', 'Hellman, Andrzej', 'Bryl, Ewa', 'Witkowski, Jacek M']","['Mikosik A', 'Zaremba A', 'Puchalska Z', 'Daca A', 'Smolenska Z', 'Lopatniuk P', 'Mital A', 'Hellman A', 'Bryl E', 'Witkowski JM']","['Department of Patophysiology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '79079-11-1 (calpastatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*immunology', 'Calpain/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*blood/*enzymology', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/02/08 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['45/4/2007 [pii]'],ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2007;45(4):343-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in vivo studies have shown that the application of trans-10, cis-12 CLA in obese men increased their oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether CLA can lead to an increase in oxidative stress and to isoprostane synthesis in macrophages. METHODS: Monocytes from peripheral blood and human monocytic leukemia cells were used in this study. Monocytes were differentiated to macrophages, and were incubated with 30 microM cis-9, trans-11 CLA and trans-10, cis-12 CLA or linoleic acid for 2 days. In some experiments the inhibitors of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) or respiratory chain were added. After incubation, synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), total cellular concentration of adenosine triphosphate, concentration of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha, activity of cytoplasolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), activity of mitochondria, and expression of mRNA of PPAR-alpha were measured. RESULTS: In cells cultured with CLAs intercellular ROS synthesis increased. In this condition the mitochondrial energy potential was high, and the inhibitors of the respiratory chain and PPAR-alpha reduced ROS concentration. At the same time, the cPLA2 activity was abolished. In contrast, 8-iPF2 alpha III synthesis increased in CLA cells. CONCLUSION: Cultivation of cells with CLA leads to an increased ROS synthesis, partly by PPAR-alpha mechanism. An increase in ROS concentration and inhibition of cPLA2 activity can stimulate oxygenation of arachidonic acid and contribute to an increase in 8-epi-PF2 alpha III level and in the apoptosis process in macrophages.","['Stachowska, Ewa', 'Baskiewicz-Masiuk, Magdalena', 'Dziedziejko, Violetta', 'Gutowska, Izabela', 'Baranowska-Bosiacka, Irena', 'Marchlewicz, Mariola', 'Dolegowska, Barbara', 'Wiszniewska, Barbara', 'Machalinski, Boguslaw', 'Chlubek, Dariusz']","['Stachowska E', 'Baskiewicz-Masiuk M', 'Dziedziejko V', 'Gutowska I', 'Baranowska-Bosiacka I', 'Marchlewicz M', 'Dolegowska B', 'Wiszniewska B', 'Machalinski B', 'Chlubek D']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Medical Chemistry, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland. ewa.stachowska@akuna.pl <ewa.stachowska@akuna.pl>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoprostanes)', '0 (Linoleic Acids, Conjugated)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Isoprostanes/metabolism', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'PPAR alpha/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0899-9007(07)00325-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nut.2007.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 2008 Feb;24(2):187-99. doi: 10.1016/j.nut.2007.10.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLC1 gene encodes a membrane protein (MLC1) with unknown function which is mainly expressed in astrocytes. Using a newly developed anti-human MLC1 polyclonal antibody, we have investigated the biochemical properties and localization of MLC1 in cultured astrocytes and brain tissue and searched for evidence of a relationship between MLC1 and proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Cultured astrocytes express two MLC1 components showing different solubilisation properties and subcellular distribution. Most importantly, we show that the membrane-associated component of MLC1 (60-64 kDa) localizes in astrocytic lipid rafts together with dystroglycan, syntrophin and caveolin-1, and co-fractionates with the DGC in whole rat brain tissue. In the human brain, MLC1 protein is expressed in astrocyte processes and ependymal cells, where it colocalizes with dystroglycan and syntrophin. These data indicate that the DGC may be involved in the organization and function of the MLC1 protein in astrocyte membranes.","['Ambrosini, Elena', 'Serafini, Barbara', 'Lanciotti, Angela', 'Tosini, Fabio', 'Scialpi, Flavia', 'Psaila, Rossana', 'Raggi, Carla', 'Di Girolamo, Francesco', 'Petrucci, Tamara Corinna', 'Aloisi, Francesca']","['Ambrosini E', 'Serafini B', 'Lanciotti A', 'Tosini F', 'Scialpi F', 'Psaila R', 'Raggi C', 'Di Girolamo F', 'Petrucci TC', 'Aloisi F']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neurosciences, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy. elena.ambrosini@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071117,United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Dystrophin-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (syntrophin)', '146888-27-9 (Dystroglycans)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Astrocytoma/pathology', 'Brain/cytology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dystroglycans/*metabolism', 'Dystrophin-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Microdomains/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-7431(07)00265-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2007.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2008 Mar;37(3):480-93. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2007.11.003.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common blood cancer. It is now generally agreed that both genetic and environmental factors play an interactive role in the development of ALL disease. It is unknown whether there exists a restriction to certain MHC genotypes in leukemia like ALL. METHODS: Genetic construct of HLA DRB1 was studied in Iranian normal populations and in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using PCR-SSP method. RESULTS: It was shown that the most common allele in DRB1 locus in normal population was DRB1*11 (20%), whereas DRB1*09 was the least frequent allele (0.9%). Additionally, this study presented the results of HLA-DRB1 typing in 106 ALL patients and compared them with normal individuals. Comparison of the results between the normal population and the patient group revealed that there was allelic association between the DRB1*13 and the disease. Results showed that the difference between the frequencies of DRB1*13 in patients and normal individuals was significant (p=0.04), but there was a moderate difference among the frequencies of DRB1*04, *07, and *09 in childhood (0-15 years) ALL. The frequencies of DRB1*13, *04, and *07 in patients were 2.5, 16, 4.5% and, in normal individuals, were 11.4, 10, and 8.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It should be concluded that DRB1*13, which showed a decrease in patients, should be protective against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas DRB1*04, which was moderately increased in patients, could be considered a susceptible allele for childhood ALL.","['Yari, Fatemeh', 'Sobhani, Maryam', 'Sabaghi, Fatemeh', 'Zaman-Vaziri, Maryam', 'Bagheri, Nadia', 'Talebian, Ali']","['Yari F', 'Sobhani M', 'Sabaghi F', 'Zaman-Vaziri M', 'Bagheri N', 'Talebian A']","['Research Center, Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran. yari@ibto.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071126,United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/*genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/immunology']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/03/13 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2007/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0188-4409(07)00332-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcmed.2007.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2008 Feb;39(2):205-8. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2007.09.009.

We previously isolated 3 structurally similar cytotoxic alkyl hydroquinone compounds from the sap of the lacquer tree Rhus succedanea L. belonging to the sumac family, which have a long history of medicinal use in Asia. Each has an unsaturated alkyl chain attached to the 2-position of a hydroquinone ring. One of these isolates, 10'(Z),13'(E),15'(E)-heptadecatrienylhydroquinone [HQ17(3)], being the most cytotoxic, was chosen for studying the anticancer mechanism of these compounds. We found that HQ17(3) was a topoisomerase (Topo) II poison. It irreversibly inhibited Topo IIalpha activity through the accumulation of Topo II-DNA cleavable complexes. A cell-based assay showed that HQ17(3) inhibited the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells with an EC50 of 0.9 microM, inhibited the topoisomerase-II-deficient cells HL-60/MX2 with an EC50 of 9.6 microM, and exerted no effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells at concentrations up to 50 microM. These results suggest that Topo II is the cellular drug target. In HL-60 cells, HQ17(3) promptly inhibited DNA synthesis, induced chromosomal breakage, and led to cell death with an EC50 about one-tenth that of hydroquinone. Pretreatment of the cells with N-acetylcysteine could not attenuate the cytotoxicity and DNA damage induced by HQ17(3). However, N-acetylcysteine did significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of hydroquinone. In F344 rats, intraperitoneal injection of HQ17(3) for 28 days induced no clinical signs of toxicity. These results indicated that HQ17(3) is a potential anticancer agent, and its structural features could be a model for anticancer drug design.","['Huang, Cheng-Po', 'Fang, Woei-Horng', 'Lin, Liang-In', 'Chiou, Robin Y', 'Kan, Lou-Sing', 'Chi, Nai-Hui', 'Chen, Yun-Ru', 'Lin, Tin-Yu', 'Lin, Shwu-Bin']","['Huang CP', 'Fang WH', 'Lin LI', 'Chiou RY', 'Kan LS', 'Chi NH', 'Chen YR', 'Lin TY', 'Lin SB']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071122,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"[""0 (10'(Z),13'(E),15'(E)-heptadecatrienylhydroquinone)"", '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Models, Animal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rhus/chemistry', 'Serum/chemistry', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2007/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(07)00516-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2007.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Mar 15;227(3):331-8. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2007.11.014.

There has been great interest in a novel set of agents that are able to mimic the function of the BH3 domain by binding to the groove of Bcl-2-like proteins and initiating the cell death sequence. We sought to examine the efficacy of BH3 mimetics in a spontaneous mouse model of B-cell neoplasia. We evaluated the ability of the BH3 mimetics to preferentially target tumor cells while sparing normal cells. In addition, we examined the contributions of Bim and Puma to the sensitivity of tumor cells to the BH3 mimetics. We report here that two BH3 mimetics (HA-14-1 and BH3-I-2') were able to induce apoptosis of murine B-cell lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Tumors that arose from transplantation of primary lymphoma cells regressed following 7 days of treatment with BH3-mimetic drugs. The long-term benefits of the transient treatment of tumor-bearing mice with the BH3 mimetics, however, could not be properly evaluated, due to the high levels of toxicity we observed in vivo with these drugs. Decreased expression of either Bim or Puma from B-cell tumor cells was able to protect these cells from the apoptosis induced by these BH3 mimetics, suggesting that they function through other means. We conclude that while the BH3-mimetic drugs are effective at inducing cell death of lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo, their unclear molecular specificity and their ability to kill normal cells may limit their therapeutic uses in humans.","['Turner, Brian C', 'Eves, Taylor', 'Refaeli, Yosef']","['Turner BC', 'Eves T', 'Refaeli Y']","['Program in Cell Biology, Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biomimetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2007.0675 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2008 Mar;27(3):133-42. doi: 10.1089/dna.2007.0675.,,,['CA-11802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The isoflavones present in soy have been shown in animal models to have cancer-preventing activity. However, the therapeutic effects of isoflavones against cancer are still unclear. We have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antileukemic activity of genistein (1), a major isoflavone present in soy. We observed that it produced a dose- and time-dependent antineoplastic activity against myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines. In addition, genistein treatment of the leukemic cells reactivated tumor suppressor genes that were silenced by aberrant DNA methylation. A genistein-enriched diet produced a moderate, but significant, antileukemic effect in mice. The limited extent of this in vivo response may have been due to the rapid metabolic inactivation of genistein in mice. Due to the longer half-life of genistein in humans, a soy-enriched diet has the potential to produce plasma levels of this isoflavone in the range of the concentrations used in vitro that produced an antileukemic activity.","['Raynal, Noel J-M', 'Momparler, Louise', 'Charbonneau, Michel', 'Momparler, Richard L']","['Raynal NJ', 'Momparler L', 'Charbonneau M', 'Momparler RL']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Laval, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071229,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/blood/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Genistein/blood/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diet therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diet therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Soybeans/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/04/03 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/np070230s [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2008 Jan;71(1):3-7. doi: 10.1021/np070230s.

The assay uses fluorescence energy transfer measurements to detect the incorporation of complementary pairs of fluorescently labeled deoxyuridine into cDNA product. The fluorescently labeled dUTP substrates were prepared using commercially available reagents with a simple coupling reaction. The fluorescent dye pairs have significant spectral overlap which allows FRET interaction between dyes incorporated into the cDNA. Using a polyA/oligo dT primer/template, the assay can readily detect DNA polymerase activity from any viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. The reaction proceeds linearly over time, and the rate is proportional to the enzyme concentration. We used the assay to compare the thermostability of a number of wild-type and mutant viral RT enzymes. Our results indicate that the wild-type AMV (avian myeloblastosis virus) enzyme is slightly more stable at 43 degrees C than the HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus) or MMLV (Moloney murine leukemia virus) enzymes. The thermostability of the RT enzyme was dramatically increased by the presence of primer/template with the enzyme. We also used the assay to study the effects of inhibitors on HIV-1 RT polymerase activity.

While inflammation has been proposed to play an important role in both benign and malignant growth of the prostate, the stimuli for this inflammation remain poorly characterized. Infectious pathogens are potential stimuli for prostatic inflammation. METHODS: Universal eubacterial PCR was used to test 170 prostate tissue core samples from 30 cancer patients for 16S rDNA gene sequences. Positive PCR products (n=64, 37%) were cloned and sequenced. For comparison, tissue samples from 30 patients were cultured using standard clinical microbiological techniques. DNA samples from 200 additional patients were tested by organism-specific PCR for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Propionibacterium acnes, Trichomonas vaginalis, BK virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, human papillomavirus, and xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus. RESULTS: 16S sequencing results indicated the presence of 83 distinct microorganisms. Microbiological culture isolated markedly fewer species. In general, organism-specific PCR failed to detect multiple organisms previously reported as common in the prostate. There was no significant association between the presence of particular species of bacteria and histologic evidence of acute or chronic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Most prostates from men undergoing prostatectomy (87%) contain bacterial DNA from one or more species. However, the majority of individual tissue core samples were negative, suggesting regional heterogeneity in the presence of bacteria and a lack of a generalized or ubiquitous prostatic flora. Culture results suggest either the ""unculturable"" nature of species present in the prostate or that 16S rDNA sequences were derived from non-viable bacteria.","['Sfanos, Karen S', 'Sauvageot, Jurga', 'Fedor, Helen L', 'Dick, James D', 'De Marzo, Angelo M', 'Isaacs, William B']","['Sfanos KS', 'Sauvageot J', 'Fedor HL', 'Dick JD', 'De Marzo AM', 'Isaacs WB']","['Department of Urology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*microbiology/pathology/virology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/*microbiology/pathology', 'DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*microbiology/pathology/virology', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Virus Diseases/pathology/*virology']",2008/01/01 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2008/01/01 09:00'],"['2008/01/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pros.20680 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2008 Feb 15;68(3):306-20. doi: 10.1002/pros.20680.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, unique gene expression profiles differentiating BL and DLBCL were reported and include higher transcript levels of T-cell leukemia-1 (TCL1) and CD38 and lower transcript levels of CD44 in MYC+ BL relative to MYC- DLBCL. We examined a cohort of 67 cytogenetically defined aggressive lymphomas using immunohistochemical techniques for expression of TCL1, CD38, and CD44 and found distinct expression patterns between MYC+ and MYC- tumors. Furthermore, these markers are better predictors of MYC status than combined staining for CD10 and BCL2. Thus staining for TCL1, CD38, and CD44 are useful ancillary tests to identify B-cell tumors for which confirmatory cytogenetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization studies assessing the status of the MYC locus should be pursued.","['Rodig, Scott J', 'Vergilio, Jo-Anne', 'Shahsafaei, Aliakbar', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Rodig SJ', 'Vergilio JA', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/12/29 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/29 09:00'],"['2007/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e3180959e09 [doi]', '00000478-200801000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2008 Jan;32(1):113-22. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3180959e09.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 75% of EMS patients present with or develop precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and most subsequently develop acute myeloid leukemia. Here we describe the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of 6 cases of t(8;13)-positive bilineal lymphoma of mixed T-cell and myeloid lineage, 5 in lymph nodes and 1 in breast. The patients, 3 males and 3 females, ranged in age from 6 to 19 years. Histologically, each tumor was composed of 2 distinct cellular components: small to medium-sized T cells with scant cytoplasm that resembled lymphoblasts, and larger immature-appearing cells with more abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm that resembled myeloblasts, a subset of which expressed myeloid antigens. In all cases, the latter component tended to surround residual lymphoid follicles and/or blood vessels. Numerous eosinophils and prominent high endothelial venules were present in all of the lymph node specimens. Interestingly, cells of both components expressed CD3 on immunohistochemical stains. In conclusion, EMS associated with t(8;13) should be suspected in patients with a bilineal tumor that involves lymph nodes or other extramedullary sites. We believe that these bilineal neoplasms of mixed T-cell and myeloid lineages, which present as lymphoma, are analogous to bilineal leukemias. They likely arise from an early hematopoietic cell with potential to differentiate along T-cell and myeloid pathways.","['Vega, Francisco', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Davuluri, Rajayogesh', 'Cromwell, Candy C', 'Alkan, Serhan', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['Vega F', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Davuluri R', 'Cromwell CC', 'Alkan S', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/12/29 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/29 09:00'],"['2007/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31814b226e [doi]', '00000478-200801000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2008 Jan;32(1):14-20. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31814b226e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The measurement of mean diameter of nucleolar bodies in specimens stained for RNA was very simple. Such approach eliminated the variability of the perinucleolar chromatin discontinuous shell which might influence the measured nucleolar size as suggested by earlier studies. Ageing of K 562 myeloblasts produced a significant decrease of cells in S+G2 phase of the cell cycle accompanied by a significant reduction of mean diameter of nucleolar bodies (MDNoBs) per cell. In contrast, treatment of Kasumi 1 myeloblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitor - Trichostatin A - produced a large incidence of resistant cells in S+G2 phase which were characterised by a large increase of MDNoBs. Thus, MDNoBs in leukemic myeloblasts might be a helpful tool to estimate the incidence of cells in the S+G2 phase at the single cell level in smear preparations when the number of cells is very small.","['Smetana, Karel', 'Kuzelova, K', 'Zapotocky, M', 'Starkova, J', 'Hrkal, Z', 'Trka, J']","['Smetana K', 'Kuzelova K', 'Zapotocky M', 'Starkova J', 'Hrkal Z', 'Trka J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U nemocnice 1, Prague 2, Czech Republic, 128 20 karel.smetana@uhkt.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur J Histochem,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,9207930,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (nucleolar organizer region associated proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleolus/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'G2 Phase/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'S Phase/*physiology']",2007/12/29 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/12/29 09:00'],"['2007/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Histochem. 2007 Oct-Dec;51(4):269-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients received weekly 10mg/kg infusions of L-AmB for 4 weeks for AL and 8 weeks for SCT. The primary objective was safety, with particular attention to infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity. Twenty-nine adult patients were included: 21 AL (median age 52 years) and 8 SCT (median age 37 years). The most frequent adverse events (AEs) related to study drug were infusion-related reactions, 12 of which (from a total of 76 infusions) led to increased infusion duration for better tolerance. No AE related to the study drug led to discontinuation of prophylactic treatment in AL patients. In SCT patients, eight AEs (in six patients) reported to be related to study treatment led to treatment discontinuation. Enrolment was discontinued in the SCT group as recommended by the independent data review committee in accordance with the 10% limit of AEs (CTC grade 3-4) fixed by the protocol. The appropriate timing of high-dose prophylactic L-AmB remains to be determined in the SCT setting to optimise the safety profile of this regimen.

A detailed understanding of these processes could lead to development of therapeutics that more effectively treat hematopoietic malignancies and potentially other cancers.","['Jones, Richard J', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Jones RJ', 'Armstrong SA']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/pathology']",2008/01/01 00:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2008/01/01 00:00'],"['2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00542-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jan;14(1 Suppl 1):12-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.10.012.,23,,,,,,,,,,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Nov;14(11):1317-8'],,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20080104'],,,,,,,

Therefore, KG1a, a myeloid leukaemia cell line, was exposed to Tnf in the absence or presence of either HS-5 or HS-27a cells, two human stroma cell lines. While KG1a cells were resistant to Tnf-induced apoptosis in the absence of stroma cells, Tnf-promoted apoptosis of KG1a cells in co-culture experiments with stroma cells. To investigate the Tnf-induced signals from the stroma cells, we examined expression changes in HS-5 and HS-27a cells after Tnf exposure. DNA microarray studies found both discordant and concordant Tnf-induced expression responses in the two stroma cell lines. Tnf promoted an increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g. interleukin (IL)6, IL8 and IL32]. At the same time, Tnf decreased the mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic genes (e.g. BCL2L1) and increased the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic genes (e.g. BID). Overall, the results suggested that Tnf induced a complex set of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals in stroma cells that promote apoptosis in malignant myeloid clones. Additional studies will be required to determine which of these signals are critical for the induction of apoptosis in the malignant clones. Those insights, in turn, may point the way to novel therapeutic approaches.","['Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Mhyre, Andrew J', 'Marcondes, Mario', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan, Era', 'Abbasi, Nissa', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Stirewalt DL', 'Mhyre AJ', 'Marcondes M', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan E', 'Abbasi N', 'Radich JP', 'Deeg HJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. dstirewa@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071219,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*physiopathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2007/12/29 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2007/12/29 09:00'],"['2007/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6923 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06923.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Feb;140(4):444-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06923.x.

We sought to apply array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) technology for the simultaneous detection of genomic imbalances of all loci implicated in CLL. DNA from enriched B-cells from CLL patients were analyzed by array-CGH on a customized CLL BAC array. Copy number changes were detected in 87% of samples with a sensitivity of 100% in samples with clonal abnormalities present in at least 23% of the cells.

Recent evidence suggests that alterations in proteins participating in the DNA repair systems may result in cellular senescence, cell death, and neoplastic transformation. Malignancies in adulthood exhibit genomic instability and an increased mutation rate due to underlying defects in DNA repair. However, our knowledge on DNA repair defects, both in germline and somatic mutations, and their relationship with childhood malignancies remains incomplete. Mutations, gene deletions, and inversions in various DNA repair genes have been reported and special attention has recently been focused on the interaction between these abnormalities and malignant transformation in childhood. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing clinical information concerning components of the DNA repair systems and their influence on the development of the most common pediatric malignancies, including leukemia, tumors of the central nervous system, rhabdomyosarcoma, and retinoblastoma. Such information could possibly explain the response or resistance to chemotherapy and the possible risk of relapse in childhood malignancies presenting specific DNA repair defects. Additionally, these data could be beneficial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Papaefthymiou, Maria A', 'Giaginis, Costas T', 'Theocharis, Stamatios E']","['Papaefthymiou MA', 'Giaginis CT', 'Theocharis SE']","['Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Mismatch Repair', 'DNA Repair/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Retinal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/genetics/metabolism']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/04/18 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['636053 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2008 Jan;14(1):RA8-15.,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the proportion of hemopoietic stem cells and their differentiation have been studied by immunophenotyping using the flow cytometry, no substantial research efforts have been directed toward the regenerating marrow. We attempted to discover the proportions of undifferentiated stem cells, committed stem cells, B cell precursors, and myeloid precursors in the regenerating bone marrows during complete remission (CR) and after engraftment of BMT. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 82 patients with acute leukemia in CR and from 25 patients after BMT engraftment, along with 22 control samples, were used to find the numbers of CD38-/CD34+, CD38+/CD34+, CD19+/CD34+, and CD13,33+/CD34+ cells in the large lymphocyte gate by flow cytometry. We cross-analyzed our results in terms of groups: CR, BMT, and initial diagnosis groups. We performed significance tests on age, relapse, chromosomal abnormalities, clinical outcomes, and initial immunophenotypes of the leukemic cells. RESULTS: The proportions of CD38-/CD34+, CD38+/CD34+, CD19+/CD34+, and CD13,33+/CD34+ cells are more highly distributed in acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia than the normal group and also in the CR than the BMT group. CD19+/CD34+ cells were increased in the relapse group and CD38+/ CD34+, CD19+/CD34+, and CD13,33+/CD34+ cells were increased in the group with chromosomal abnormality. The results were irrelevant to the initial immunophenotype of the leukemic blasts. CONCLUSIONS: The increases of the markers spanned too widely to apply one specific cutoff value to analyze them. They seemed to be the results of normal regeneration, irrelevant to relapse or initial immunophenotype of leukemic blasts.","['Kahng, Jimin', 'Shin, So Young', 'Han, Kyungja']","['Kahng J', 'Shin SY', 'Han K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Catholic University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['kor'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/therapy', 'Regeneration', 'Remission Induction']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['200712406 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.6.406 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2007 Dec;27(6):406-13. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.6.406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry of cytCD79a was performed retrospectively. Laboratory and clinical findings were reviewed. RESULTS: Five patients among 68 AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22) revealed cytCD79a positive reaction; scores for myeloid lineage/B-lymphoid lineage were 5/3-3.5.

Bax is an essential proapoptotic protein and decreased levels in malignant cells lead to resistance to apoptosis. Using a Bax degradation activity (BDA) assay, CLL cells were found to show variable Bax instability. However, BDA did not correlate with Bax protein levels: BDA positive and negative cases had high and low baseline Bax levels. BDA positive cases showed a marked accumulation of poor prognostic markers-unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes, ZAP-70/CD38 positivity, 11q22/17p13 deletion, and short lymphocyte doubling time. Patients with BDA positive cells had a shorter median overall survival (OS; 126 months vs not reached, P = .011) and time to first treatment (16 vs 156 months, P = .029) than BDA negative cases. Dual BDA and ZAP-70 positivity had a median OS of 84 months (P = .012). The BDA assay measures the intrinsic ubiquitin/proteasome activity of CLL cells and dynamic changes in Bax protein levels over time. Mechanistically, Bax instability may represent a final common pathway for disparate prognostic markers, as well as being itself an indicator of poor prognosis.","['Agrawal, Samir G', 'Liu, Feng-Ting', 'Wiseman, Catherine', 'Shirali, Sima', 'Liu, Hongxiang', 'Lillington, Debra', 'Du, Ming-Qing', 'Syndercombe-Court, Denise', 'Newland, Adrian C', 'Gribben, John G', 'Jia, Li']","['Agrawal SG', 'Liu FT', 'Wiseman C', 'Shirali S', 'Liu H', 'Lillington D', 'Du MQ', 'Syndercombe-Court D', 'Newland AC', 'Gribben JG', 'Jia L']","['Centre for Haematology, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Departments of Haematology and Haemato-Oncology, Queen Mary University of London, UK. s.g.agrawal@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071226,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51560-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-110460 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 1;111(5):2790-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-110460.

In this study, we found that expression of Aur-A was markedly elevated in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) obtained from a significant portion of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Targeting human primary AML cells with Aur-A kinase inhibitory VX-680 led to apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, VX-680-induced cell death was preferentially higher in Aur-A-high primary leukemic blasts compared with Aur-A-low AML (P < .001) or normal BMMCs (P < .001), suggesting the possible pharmacologic window in targeting Aurora kinase among Aur-A-high VX-680-sensitive leukemia patients. VX-680-induced cell death in AML cell lines was accompanied by formation of monopolar mitotic spindles, G(2)/M phase arrest, decreased phosphorylated(p)-Akt-1, and increased proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. Notably, VX-680 increased Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio, a favorable proapoptotic predictor for drug response and survival in AML. Lastly, VX-680 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide (VP16) on AML cells. Together, we concluded that Aurora kinases were potentially therapeutic targets for AML and that Aur-A-high expression may serve as a differential marker for selective treatment.","['Huang, Xue-Fei', 'Luo, Shao-Kai', 'Xu, Jie', 'Li, Juan', 'Xu, Duo-Rong', 'Wang, Li-Hui', 'Yan, Min', 'Wang, Xian-Ren', 'Wan, Xiang-Bo', 'Zheng, Fei-Meng', 'Zeng, Yi-Xin', 'Liu, Quentin']","['Huang XF', 'Luo SK', 'Xu J', 'Li J', 'Xu DR', 'Wang LH', 'Yan M', 'Wang XR', 'Wan XB', 'Zheng FM', 'Zeng YX', 'Liu Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071226,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51567-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-099325 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 1;111(5):2854-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-099325.

PML, the organizer of cellular nuclear substructures known as PML nuclear bodies or ND10, is one of the most notable proteins that is targeted by ICP0. Depletion of PML from human fibroblasts increases ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 gene expression, but not to wild-type levels. In this study, we report that depletion of Sp100, another major ND10 protein, results in a similar increase in ICP0-null mutant gene expression and that simultaneous depletion of both proteins complements the mutant virus to a greater degree. Although chromatin assembly and modification undoubtedly play major roles in the regulation of HSV-1 infection, we found that inhibition of histone deacetylase activity with trichostatin A was unable to complement the defect of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 in either normal or PML-depleted human fibroblasts.

However, the molecular mechanism for its function is largely unknown. Here we show that Hes6 is a component of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) complex in the nuclei and that Hes6 inhibits cell proliferation through induction of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. We further show that Hes6 directly interacts with CREB-binding protein (CBP), one of the key components of PML-NB, via its basic domain. This association is critical for p21 induction through multiple mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling and p53 acetylation. Taken together, these results suggest that the Hes6-CBP complex in PML-NB may influence the proliferation of cells via p53-dependent and -independent pathways.","['Eun, Bokkee', 'Lee, Yool', 'Hong, Soontaek', 'Kim, Jaesang', 'Lee, Han-Woong', 'Kim, Kyungjin', 'Sun, Woong', 'Kim, Hyun']","['Eun B', 'Lee Y', 'Hong S', 'Kim J', 'Lee HW', 'Kim K', 'Sun W', 'Kim H']","['College of Medicine, Brain Korea 21, Korea University, Seoul 136-705, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071226,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (HES6 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'CREB-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)57312-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M707683200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Feb 29;283(9):5939-49. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M707683200.

Study of the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) from the Salmonella mutagenicity data revealed that several descriptors could describe cytotoxic and mutagenic activities after photo-activation. From the results of the mutagenicity test, four compounds with elevated mutagenic activities were selected for additional experiments.

Comparison of the minimal genotoxic concentrations showed that two compounds possessed higher capacities to induce SSB after photo-activation.

Since arsenic trioxide selectively kills human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells by a poorly understood mechanism we screened the yeast deletion strains for sensitivity or resistance. In addition to confirming mutants previously identified as sensitive to sodium arsenite, a large number of additional genes, and cellular processes, were required for arsenic trioxide tolerance. Of the 4546 mutants, 7.6% were more sensitive to arsenic trioxide than the wild type, while 1.5% was more resistant. IC50 values for all sensitive and resistant mutants were determined. Prominent as sensitive was that missing the MAP kinase, Hog1. The most resistant lacked the plasma-membrane glycerol and arsenite transporter, Fps1. Hog1 and Fps1 control the response to osmotic stress in yeast by regulating glycerol production and plasma membrane flux, respectively. We therefore tested whether APL cells have impaired osmoregulation. The APL cell line NB4 did not produce glycerol in response to osmotic stress and underwent apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the glycerol content of NB4 and differentiated NB4 cells correlated with the level of arsenic trioxide uptake and the sensitivity of the cells. Additionally, NB4 cells accumulated more arsenic trioxide than non-APL cells and were more sensitive. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of the S. cerevisiae deletion set and show that the selectivity of arsenic trioxide for APL cells relates, at least in part, to impaired osmoregulation and control of uptake of the drug.","['Dilda, Pierre J', 'Perrone, Gabriel G', 'Philp, Amanda', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Dawes, Ian W', 'Hogg, Philip J']","['Dilda PJ', 'Perrone GG', 'Philp A', 'Lock RB', 'Dawes IW', 'Hogg PJ']","['UNSW Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071113,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (FPS1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (HOG1 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Deletion', 'Glutathione/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/metabolism/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Vacuoles/physiology']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(07)00382-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2007.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2008;40(5):1016-29. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2007.11.002.

After FV challenge, viral loads in the spleens of C57BL/6 mice were reduced approximately 250-fold and were below the detection threshold in >50% of the mice. Vaccination outcome was critically influenced by the route of vector administration. In CB6F1 mice, vaccination resulted in reduced viremia, delayed onset of splenomegaly, and induction of FV-specific T cells as assessed by tetramer staining. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination resulted in significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers, translating into improved immune protection, in contrast to coexpression of cytokines.

Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is the inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) that epitomizes the effects of abnormal telomere biology. Patients with DC have extremely short telomere lengths (<1st percentile) and many have mutations in telomere biology genes. Interpretation of telomere length in other IBMFSs is less straightforward. Abnormal telomere shortening has been reported in patients with apparently acquired hematologic disorders, including aplastic anemia, myeolodysplasia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and leukemia. In these disorders, the shortest-lived cells have the shortest telomeres, suggestive of increased hematopoietic stress. Telomeres are also markers of replicative and/or oxidative stress in other complex disease pathways, such as inflammation, stress, and carcinogenesis. The spectrum of related disorders caused by mutations in telomere biology genes extends beyond classical DC to include marrow failure that does not respond to immunosuppression, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and possibly other syndromes. We suggest that such patients be categorized as having an inherited disorder of telomere biology. Longitudinal studies of patients with very short telomeres but without classical DC are necessary to further understand the long-term sequelae, such as malignancy, osteonecrosis/osteoporosis, and pulmonary and liver disease.","['Savage, Sharon A', 'Alter, Blanche P']","['Savage SA', 'Alter BP']","['Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20892, United States. savagesh@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071119,Ireland,Mech Ageing Dev,Mechanisms of ageing and development,0347227,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inheritance Patterns', 'Mutation', 'Syndrome', 'Telomere/chemistry/*metabolism']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0047-6374(07)00177-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mad.2007.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mech Ageing Dev. 2008 Jan-Feb;129(1-2):35-47. doi: 10.1016/j.mad.2007.11.002.

Tal1 and Lyl1 are aberrantly over-expressed in leukemia as a result of chromosomal translocations, or other genetic or epigenetic events. Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions described so far are mediated by their highly homologous bHLH domains, while little is known about the function of other protein domains. Hetero-dimers of Tal1 and Lyl1 with E2A or HEB, decrease the rate of E2A or HEB homo-dimer formation and are poor activators of transcription. In vitro, these hetero-dimers also recognize different binding sites from homo-dimer complexes, which may also lead to inappropriate activation or repression of promoters in vivo. Both mechanisms are thought to contribute to the oncogenic potential of Tal1 and Lyl1. Despite their bHLH structural similarity, accumulating evidence suggests that Tal1 and Lyl1 target different genes. This raises the possibility that domains flanking the bHLH region, which are distinct in the two proteins, may participate in target recognition. Here we report that CREB1, a widely-expressed transcription factor and a suspected oncogene in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was identified as a binding partner for Lyl1 but not for Tal1. The interaction between Lyl1 and CREB1 involves the N terminal domain of Lyl1 and the Q2 and KID domains of CREB1. The histone acetyl-transferases p300 and CBP are recruited to these complexes in the absence of CREB1 Ser 133 phosphorylation. In the Id1 promoter, Lyl1 complexes direct transcriptional activation. We also found that in addition to Id1, over-expressed Lyl1 can activate other CREB1 target promoters such as Id3, cyclin D3, Brca1, Btg2 and Egr1. Moreover, approximately 50% of all gene promoters identified by ChIP-chip experiments were jointly occupied by CREB1 and Lyl1, further strengthening the association of Lyl1 with Cre binding sites. Given the newly recognized importance of CREB1 in AML, the ability of Lyl1 to modulate promoter responses to CREB1 suggests that it plays a role in the malignant phenotype by occupying different promoters than Tal1.","['San-Marina, Serban', 'Han, Youqi', 'Suarez Saiz, Fernando', 'Trus, Michael R', 'Minden, Mark D']","['San-Marina S', 'Han Y', 'Suarez Saiz F', 'Trus MR', 'Minden MD']","['Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, 610 University Avenue 9-111, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071207,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (LYL1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '147785-34-0 (ID3 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism/physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/genetics', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transfection']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/04/03 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(07)00282-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Mar;1783(3):503-17. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.11.015.

Chemotherapy is usually not indicated in early and stable disease and using Chlorambucil with or without steroids has been the drug of choice in the treatment of CLL for many years . Clinical studies have shown that using Fludarabin can cause a complete response in significant number of untreated and/or previously treated CLL patients. The aim of this study is evaluating of CLL patients and determining the effects of treatment with Fludarabin. METHODS: A retrospective (descriptive/cross sectional) study of CLL patients who admitted to Hematology and Oncology Research Center of Tabriz university of Medical Sciences, between 1995-2005 was made and 126 patients enrolled. Collection of data was carried out according to special questionnaire and response to Fludarabin was analyzed by SPSS 11 software. RESULTS: The patients mean age of diagnosis was 63.7 years (SD=8.9), 69.8% were males. Illness and fatigue were the commonest presenting symptoms in 54% and lymphadenopathy was the most common clinical sign in 88.9%. Most of the patients were in stage C in Binet system (52.4%) and/or stage IV in Rai system (44.4%). Chemotherapy with chlorambucil and Prednisolone was the most common regimen used (60.3%) and 49.2% of patients were in partial remission with this treatment. Forty two patients treated with Fludarabin and 50% were in partial remission, 35% in static disease, 10% in progressive disease and 5% in complete remission (P=0.053). CONCLUSION: The median survival with Fludarabin was 43.9 months (SD=27.2) and in the case of Chlorambucil+Prednisolone and CVP or Chop it was 45 months (SD=26.5) and 50 months (SD=32.2), respectively (P>0.05). P value in the relationship with survival and response to Fludarabin was more than 0.05. Above all, Fludarabin is the choice treatment as first and second line therapy, as well as for patients who have failed therapy with standard regimens.","['Kermani, Iraj Asvadi', 'Dehdilani, Mahnaz', 'Dolatkhah, Roya']","['Kermani IA', 'Dehdilani M', 'Dolatkhah R']","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Daneshgah Ave. Po Box 5166614731 Tabriz/ IR Iran. irajkermani@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2007/12/28 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/12/28 09:00'],"['2007/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2007 Jul-Sep;8(3):367-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mammalian cells, MLF1 has been described as mainly cytoplasmic, but in Drosophila, one of the dMLF isoforms (dMLFA) localized mainly in the nucleus while the other isoform (dMLFB), that appears to be produced by the alternative splicing, displays both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. To investigate the difference in subcellular localization between MLF family members, we examined the subcellular localization of deletion mutants of dMLFA isoform. The analyses showed that the C-terminal 40 amino acid region of dMLFA is necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. Based on amino acid sequences, we hypothesized that two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are present within the region. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues within the two putative NLSs leads to loss of nuclear localization, suggesting that both NLS motifs are necessary for nuclear localization.","['Sugano, Wakana', 'Yamaguchi, Masamitsu']","['Sugano W', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Applied Biology and Insect Biomedical Research Center, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Matsugasaki, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071221,Japan,Cell Struct Funct,Cell structure and function,7608465,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Mlf protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/embryology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics']",2007/12/27 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/27 09:00'],"['2007/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/csf/07039 [pii]', '10.1247/csf.07039 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Struct Funct. 2007;32(2):163-9. doi: 10.1247/csf.07039.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), an estrogen-regulated gene in mice, is an absolutely needed cytokine for uterine receptivity and implantation in this species. This study aimed to evaluate the importance of Lif ligand-receptor signaling during uterine receptivity and implantation in hamsters. We investigated whether or not the uterine expression patterns of Lif and its receptors, Lif-r and gp130, during the periimplantation period of pregnancy and its hormonal regulation in the ovariectomized hamster correlate with some of the vital phases of uterine changes during early pregnancy. Uterine Lif, Lif-r, and gp130 mRNA expressions were examined by Northern and in situ hybridization. During the uterine preparatory phase for implantation, Lif, Lif-r, and gp130 were expressed either in the gland, luminal epithelium or both. As the implantation process began, Lif expression was minimal, but Lif-r and gp130 extended to the decidual areas. This decidual expression of Lif-r and gp130 was not dependent on the presence of the embryo since these genes were expressed in the suture-induced deciduomata. We also observed that, while the uterine Lif was induced by estrogen, Lif-r and gp130 were induced by progesterone in ovariectomized hamsters. Additionally, we show that a Lif antibody when instilled intraluminally on day 3 of pregnancy reduced the number of implantation sites. Taken together, these data suggest that Lif signaling is important for uterine receptivity and implantation in hamsters.","['Ding, Tianbing', 'Song, Haengseok', 'Wang, Xiaohong', 'Khatua, Atanu', 'Paria, Bibhash C']","['Ding T', 'Song H', 'Wang X', 'Khatua A', 'Paria BC']","['Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1125 MRB IV/Light Hall, 2215 B.

Based on results obtained in murine models we have explored the CD95-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) strategy to selectively deplete alloreactivity in human donor T lymphocytes in vitro. Following stimulation of CD3(+) T cells isolated from HLA-A* 0201-positive donors with HLA or minor histocompatibility antigen mismatched hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic cells in the presence of agonistic anti-CD95 antibody, we achieved efficient and selective allodepletion across major and minor histocompatibility mismatched barriers. Residual alloreactivity was in the range of 10% and 25% using hematopoietic cells and primary keratinocytes as alloantigen-presenting cells, respectively. CD8(+) T cells specific for HLA-A * 0201-associated cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Wilms tumor 1 peptide epitopes were retained at significant numbers within the allodepleted donor lymphocyte subsets. Additionally, CD4(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells persisted after the allodepletion procedure.

Other UR-HSCT studies have yielded inconsistent results. To address this discrepancy, we evaluated candidate factors contributing to the effects of KIR-L-MM on transplantation outcomes in retrospectively selected hematologic malignancy cases with uniform graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (n = 1489). KIR-L-MM in the graft-versus-host direction (KIR-L-MM-G) was associated with a higher incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD; P < .002) and a lower overall survival (OS; P < .0001) only without the preadministration of antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Furthermore, in KIR-L-MM-G, the donor KIR2DS2 gene with the patient cognate C1 ligand was associated with a higher incidence of aGVHD (P = .012). Multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazard models suggested that donor 2DS2 and ATG preadministration were critical factors in grade III-IV aGVHD (hazard ratio = 1.96; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-3.80; P = .045, and hazard ratio = 0.56; 95% confidence interval = 0.31-0.99; P = .047, respectively). These results indicate that the adverse effects of KIR-L-MM-G depend on combination of donor-activating KIR genotype-patient cognate KIR ligand type and no ATG preadministration, thereby suggesting the importance of these factors in UR-HSCT and in leukemia treatment using natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity.","['Yabe, Toshio', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Hirayasu, Kouyuki', 'Kashiwase, Koichi', 'Kawamura-Ishii, Sumiyo', 'Tanaka, Hidenori', 'Ogawa, Atsuko', 'Takanashi, Minoko', 'Satake, Masahiro', 'Nakajima, Kazunori', 'Tokunaga, Katsushi', 'Inoko, Hidetoshi', 'Saji, Hiroo', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Juji, Takeo', 'Sasazuki, Takehiko', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Morishima, Yasuo']","['Yabe T', 'Matsuo K', 'Hirayasu K', 'Kashiwase K', 'Kawamura-Ishii S', 'Tanaka H', 'Ogawa A', 'Takanashi M', 'Satake M', 'Nakajima K', 'Tokunaga K', 'Inoko H', 'Saji H', 'Ogawa S', 'Juji T', 'Sasazuki T', 'Kodera Y', 'Morishima Y']","['Japanese Red Cross Tokyo Metropolitan Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan. to-yabe@tokyo.bc.jrc.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (KIR2DL3 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",2007/12/27 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/12/27 09:00'],"['2007/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00489-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jan;14(1):75-87. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.09.012.,,,,,,,,,['Japan Marrow Donor Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using camptothecin analog NSC606985- induced leukemic U937 cell apoptosis as a model, this study performed a differential proteomic analysis during apoptosis induction. The significantly modulated protein was underwent further investigation in the apoptotic process. RESULTS: We found that beta-actin protein presented two different spots on the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) map, which shared similar molecular weight and different pI. Those two spots demonstrated contrary changes (disappeared on the basic-end and increased on the acid-end spot) during apoptosis induction, although the total level of beta-actin kept constant. This observation was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis on 2-DE gel. When NSC606985-treated cell lysate was incubated with alkaline phosphotase, beta-actin on the basic-end spot was restored, indicating increased phosphorylation of beta-actin during NSC606985- induced apoptosis. Moreover, the polymerization of actin also decreased after NSC606985 treatment. The increased beta-actin phosphorylation and decreased actin polymerization was antagonized by pre-treatment of rottlerin, a specific protein kinase C-delta (PKC delta) inhibitor. CONCLUSION: All these results indicate that beta-actin was phosphorylated during apoptosis induction, which was mediated by activated PKC delta.","['Wang, Shuang', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Yu, Yun', 'Xia, Li', 'Chen, Guo-qiang', 'Yang, Yong-zong', 'Wang, Li-shun']","['Wang S', 'Zheng Y', 'Yu Y', 'Xia L', 'Chen GQ', 'Yang YZ', 'Wang LS']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Xiangya Medical College, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2007/12/27 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2007/12/27 09:00'],"['2007/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00753.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2008 Jan;29(1):135-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00753.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The growth inhibition of HL60 cells induced by As2O3 was assessed with 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay. The activation of autophagy was determined with monodansylcadaverine labeling and transmission electron microscope. The role of autophagy in the As2O3-induced death of HL60 cells was assessed using autophagic and lysosomal inhibitors. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis were used to study the apoptotic and autophagic mechanisms. RESULTS: After treatment with As2O3, the proliferation of HL60 cells was significantly inhibited and the formation of autophagosomes increased. The blockade of autophagy maturation with the autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or the lysosome-neutralizing agent NH4Cl 1 h before As2O3 potentiated the As2O3-induced death of HL60 cells. In contrast, 3-MA attenuated As2O3-induced death when administered 30 min after As2O3. 3-MA and NH4Cl also inhibited As2O3-induced upregulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, the protein required for autophagy in mammalian cells. Following As2O3, lysosomes were activated as indicated by increased levels of cathepsins B and L. The apoptotic response of HL60 cells to As2O3 was suggested by the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and the activation of caspase-3. Pretreatment with 3-MA prior to As2O3 amplified these apoptotic signals, while posttreatment with 3-MA 30 min after As2O3 attenuated the apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: Autophagy plays complex roles in the As2O3-induced death of HL60 cells; it inhibits As2O3-induced apoptosis in the initiation stage, but amplifies the As2O3-mediated apoptotic program if it is persistently activated.","['Yang, Ya-ping', 'Liang, Zhong-qin', 'Gao, Bo', 'Jia, Yan-li', 'Qin, Zheng-hong']","['Yang YP', 'Liang ZQ', 'Gao B', 'Jia YL', 'Qin ZH']","['Department of Pharmacology and Laboratory of Aging and Nervous Diseases, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cadaverine/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects']",2007/12/27 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2007/12/27 09:00'],"['2007/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00732.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2008 Jan;29(1):123-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00732.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intraoperative bleeding is the main complication and main cause of conversion during LS. In this paper, we present our experience with 112 LS procedures, comparing two different techniques and instruments for spleen dissection and hilar vascular control. METHODS: We have performed a total of 112 LS procedures in 9 years in two affiliated university hospitals. There were 48 males and 64 females (median age, 32.8 years). Indications were as follows: idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in 42 patients, hereditary spherocitosis in 28, 6 with beta-talassemia, 1 with hemolitic anemia, 27 with lymphoma, 2 with leukemia, 3 with splenic cysts, and 3 PPT cases. Associated procedures were present in 25 cases (17 cholecystectomy and 4 liver/lymphnodal biopsies + lysis of adhesions). Patients were divided in two groups according to the method of dissection and hilar section (group 1, endostapler + monopolar coagulation with 38 patients; group 2, the Ligasure Vessel Sealing System (Valleylab, Boulder, CO) with 74 patients). RESULTS: Groups were well matched according to age, indications, spleen sizes, and procedures associated. Conversion rates (10 cases, 9%; 5 in each group), postoperative hospital stay (median 4 days in each group), and intra- and postoperative complications were similar in the 2 groups without any mortality in each group, while intraoperative blood loss (loss of 100 mL in 55 patients in group 2, 78%; and in 21 patients in group 1, 52%), transfusion rates (8 patients in group 1 versus 4 patients in group 2), and operative mean time (150 minutes in group 1 versus 125 minutes in group 2) were minor in the Ligasure Vessel Sealing System group, with a statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The approach to spleen dissection and hilum section was safe and efficacy in each case, otherwise the use of Ligasure results in a gain of time.

In the in vivo study, SGC-7901/TK cells and SGC-7901 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of BALB/C nude mice, GCV was administrated intraperitoneally, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was applied to detect the expression of the HSV-TK gene. A statistical analysis of the data was performed by using the analysis of variance. RESULTS: The SGC-7901 cells transferred with the GINaTK gene displayed a higher antitumor effect than the parent cells. In the in vitro study, when the ratio of SGC-7901/TK cells reached 10%, the tumor cell-killing proportion was 53%. In the in vivo study, all BALB/C nude mice developed tumors in 7 days after tumor cells were implanted, the ratio of tumors formation is 100%. GCV could suppress tumor formation of the SGC-7901/TK cells. After the BALB/C nude mice treated with GCV, compared with the control tumors the median tumor volume of the mice implanted with SGC-7901/TK cells and BALB/C nude mice with cells mixed was, respectively, decreased to 52.8% and 69.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The test showed that the HSV-TK gene can be transducted into the gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901, under the mediation of a retrovirus and be stably expressed, and that the HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy system could improve antitumoral efficiency. The bystander effect could be observated in the HSV-TK/GCV system both in vitro and in vivo.","['Tang, Qiusha', 'Zhang, Dongsheng', 'Wan, Meilin', 'Jin, Liqiang']","['Tang Q', 'Zhang D', 'Wan M', 'Jin L']","['School of Clinical Medical Science, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bystander Effect/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/12/27 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/12/27 09:00'],"['2007/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2007.346 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2007 Dec;22(6):755-61. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2007.346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 90 MDS patients: 19 patients with RA, 15 with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 18 with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 17 with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), and 21 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Twenty healthy individuals were also studied as the control group. We studied the PNH clone on granulocytes of these patients with the aid of flow cytometry. CD55- and CD59-deficient granulocytic populations were detected in 15.5% of MDS patients compared to 2.8% of normal individuals. Among the subgroups of the study, significant difference was present in three cases: (1) between CMML and control, (2) between CMML and RA, and (3) between CMML and RARS. These data indicate a possible association between PNH phenotype and MDS. MDS patients of worse prognosis (CMML) express more strongly the PNH clone compared to those of better prognosis (RA and RARS). Perhaps, the examination of MDS patients for the PNH clone by flow cytometry could provide us with a valuable prognostic tool.","['Kaiafa, Georgia', 'Papadopoulos, Athanasios', 'Ntaios, George', 'Saouli, Zoi', 'Savopoulos, Christos', 'Tsesmeli, Niki', 'Kontoninas, Zisis', 'Chatzinikolaou, Anastasia', 'Tsavdaridou, Vasiliki', 'Klonizakis, Ioannis', 'Hatzitolios, Apostolos']","['Kaiafa G', 'Papadopoulos A', 'Ntaios G', 'Saouli Z', 'Savopoulos C', 'Tsesmeli N', 'Kontoninas Z', 'Chatzinikolaou A', 'Tsavdaridou V', 'Klonizakis I', 'Hatzitolios A']","['First Propedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071219,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*blood/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'CD55 Antigens/analysis/*blood', 'CD59 Antigens/analysis/*blood', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/immunology']",2007/12/26 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/12/26 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-007-0420-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Apr;87(4):257-62. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0420-5.

In order to identify reliable molecular markers for prognostic prediction in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of 15 proteins, namely p53, p27, p16, RB, Smad4, PTEN, FHIT, GSTP1, MGMT, E-cadherin, nm23, CD44, TIMP3, S100A4, and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) in 138 cases of GBC using the tissue microarray method. The prognostic significance was analyzed for each protein. Overexpression of p53 and S100A4, and loss of p27, p16, RB, Smad4, FHIT, E-cadherin and PML expression were associated with poor survival. In particular, PML and p53 showed considerable potential as independent prognostic markers. Patients with normal PML and p53 expression displayed favorable outcomes, compared to those showing abnormal expression of either or both proteins (49% vs. 23% in a 5-year survival rate; 60 months vs. 11 months in median survival, respectively; P=0.009).

Several recent studies suggested that, besides the abnormal development of stem cells, microenvironmental alterations are also present in the MDS bone marrow. In this study, we have examined the relative frequencies of stem and progenitor cell subsets of MDS and normal hematopoietic cells growing on stromal cell layers established from MDS patients and from normal donors. When hematopoietic cells from MDS patients were co-cultured with normal stromal cells, the frequency of either early or late cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC) was significantly lower compared to the corresponding normal control values in 4 out of 8 patients. In the opposite situation, when normal hematopoietic cells were incubated on MDS stromal cells, the CAFC frequencies were decreased in 5 out of 6 patients, compared to normal stromal layer-containing control cultures. Moreover, a soluble Notch ligand (Jagged-1 protein) was an inhibitor of day-35-42 CAFC when normal hematopoietic cells were cultured with normal or MDS stromal cells, but was unable to inhibit MDS stem and early progenitor cell growth (day-35-42 CAFC) on pre-established stromal layers. These findings suggest that in early hematopoietic cells isolated from MDS patients the Notch signal transduction pathway is disrupted. Furthermore, there was a marked reduction in the plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells of MDS patients compared with those of normal marrow donors, in neurogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability and hematopoiesis supporting capacity in vitro. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that when alterations are present in the myelodysplastic stroma environment along with intrinsic changes in a hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell clone, both factors might equally contribute to the abnormal hematopoiesis in MDS.","['Varga, Gergely', 'Kiss, Judit', 'Varkonyi, Judit', 'Vas, Virag', 'Farkas, Peter', 'Paloczi, Katalin', 'Uher, Ferenc']","['Varga G', 'Kiss J', 'Varkonyi J', 'Vas V', 'Farkas P', 'Paloczi K', 'Uher F']","['3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071225,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",2007/12/26 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/12/26 09:00'],"['2007/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02940310 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2007;13(4):311-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02940310.

In the present study, we investigated the utility of individual TRAIL receptors in evaluating the presence of circulating tumor cells in blood. Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) carrying the t(9;22) translocation were compared with patients in whom no translocation was detected, with patients with multiple myeloma and with a group of healthy individuals. TRAIL receptor expression was analyzed by RT-PCR in blood mononuclear cells. Blood mononuclear cells of healthy subjects expressed the TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 death receptors and the TRAIL-R4 decoy receptor while the other decoy receptor TRAIL-R3 was not detectable. This normal expression pattern was also observed in all cases with multiple myeloma and in almost all patients without translocation (42/43; 97.7%). However, in 24/56 (42.9%) of the translocation-positive patients, the expression pattern was completely different. In this group the TRAIL-R4 receptor alone or in combination with TRAIL-R1 disappeared from blood mononuclear cells, while the TRAIL-R2 was expressed at normal level, indicating that the loss of expression is specific for the TRAIL-R4 and TRAIL-R1. This expression pattern was also confirmed by real-time PCR. The differences between the translocation-positive and -negative groups for the TRAIL-R4 and TRAIL-R1 expression were highly significant (p=0.0001 and p=0.0004, respectively).

The resulting gene product, BCR-ABL, encodes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase (TK) that is a factor in the pathology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Use of targeted therapy that inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity may lead to hematologic and cytogenetic responses in affected individuals. The oral TK inhibitor dasatinib was approved in 2006 for use in patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are unable to tolerate or have not responded to other treatments. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the available data on dasatinib, including its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, findings of in vitro and in vivo studies, adverse effects, and potential place in therapy. METHODS: Pertinent information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2007), EMBASE (1980-first quarter 2007), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2007) using the terms dasatinib, BMS-354825, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Sprycel, Philadelphia chromosome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All clinical studies and case reports published at the time of the search were included in this review. RESULTS: Observed mutations in the amino acid sequence of BCR-ABL cause the failure of treatment with existing TK inhibitors. Dasatinib has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against BCR-ABL, including mutations that are resistant to other available TK inhibitors. Preliminary results are available from several noncomparative studies of dasatinib in patients who were unable to tolerate or were resistant to previous therapies. The 5 phases of START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) represent the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of dasatinib in the treatment of patients in all stages of CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL who had undergone previous treatment for leukemia. Dasatanib had the greatest benefit in patients in the chronic phase of CML, with complete hematologic responses in 90% of patients, 52% of whom achieved a major hematologic response. Compared with those in the chronic phase, patients in the accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML, or with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had lower responses. In the START-R trial, which compared the response to dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (800 mg/d), both regimens had comparable ability to induce a complete hematologic response (95% and 93%, respectively), although more patients achieved a major cytogenetic response with dasatinib (32% vs 7%). Adverse effects include significant myelosuppression. Dasatinib may have the potential for use in the management of nonleukemic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib has a wider spectrum of activity against a broader range of BCR-ABL forms than existing TK inhibitors. It has shown clinical benefit and tolerability in patients in all phases of CML, as well as in those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib illustrates the potential for targeted drug development based on an understanding of the genetic alterations leading to CML and the development of resistance to treatment.","['Steinberg, Michael']",['Steinberg M'],"['Department of Pharmacy Practice, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, 19 Foster Street, Worcester, MA 01608, USA. michael.steinberg@mcphs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Contraindications', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Chemical', 'Mutation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/genetics', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2007/12/26 09:00,2008/02/21 09:00,['2007/12/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0149-2918(07)00354-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2007 Nov;29(11):2289-308. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.11.005.,52,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 Excerpta Medica, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cases were 219 patients, aged 45 to 59 years, with histologically confirmed prostate cancer, and controls were 431 men of the same age group, admitted in hospital for acute, non-neoplastic diseases. RESULTS: A family history of prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5), brain cancer (OR = 3.7), and leukemia (OR = 6.2) were associated with prostate cancer risk. A significantly increased risk was found for high education level (OR = 3.3 for 12 or more years versus less than 7 years) and a decreased risk for physical activity (OR = 0.5 for active versus inactive). Coffee consumption was directly associated with risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.9 for the third versus the first tertile). Bread consumption was directly related (OR = 1.6) and consumption of raw and total vegetables inversely related (OR = 0.6) to prostate cancer risk, although these associations were of borderline significance. No association emerged with marital status, body mass index, history of diabetes, alcohol drinking, and other considered foods.

However, the functional expression of Dock2 in immature hematopoietic cells is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Dock2 is broadly expressed in bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic compartment, including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSC/HPC) fraction. Response of Dock2-/- HPCs to CXCL12 in chemotaxis and actin polymerization in vitro was impaired, although alpha4 integrin activation by CXCL12 was not altered. Myelosuppressive stress on HSCs in vivo, such as consecutive 5-FU administration and serial bone marrow transplantation, did not show hematopoietic defect in Dock2-/- mice. Long-term engraftment of transplanted Dock2-/- BM cells was severely impaired in competitive reconstitution. However, this was not intrinsic to HSCs but originated from the defective competition of Dock2-/- lymphoid precursors. These results suggest that Dock2 plays a significant role in BM lymphopoiesis, but is dispensable for HSC engraftment and self-renewal.","['Kikuchi, Tomoko', 'Kubonishi, Shiro', 'Shibakura, Misako', 'Namba, Noriko', 'Matsui, Toshimitsu', 'Fukui, Yoshinori', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Katayama, Yoshio']","['Kikuchi T', 'Kubonishi S', 'Shibakura M', 'Namba N', 'Matsui T', 'Fukui Y', 'Tanimoto M', 'Katayama Y']","['Hematology, Oncology, and Respiratory Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071226,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (DOCK2 protein, mouse)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/physiology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors']",2007/12/26 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2007/12/26 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02725-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.093 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Feb 29;367(1):90-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.093.

CML28, a novel antigen with the properties of cancer/ testis (CT) antigens, is an attractive target for antigen-specific immunotherapy. Here we investigated the feasibility of inducing CML28-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses using DCs transduced with the rAAV2 vectors containing the CML28 gene (rAAV/CML28). Using an adenovirus-free packaging system, rAAV/CML28 was generated. The transduction efficiency of rAAV/CML28 in DCs increased in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent manner. The rAAV/CML28 transduction did not impair DC maturation, but even enhanced the CD80 expression. The rAAV/CML28-transduced DCs induced CML28-specific CTLs which exhibited a MHC class I-mediated antigen-specific lytic activity against CML28-bearing tumor cell lines (HepG2 and MCF-7) as well as the primary leukemia blasts.

METHODS: To define more clearly the clinical and radiological musculoskeletal manifestations of leukemia in children, 122 affected children referred from 1984 to 1999 to our Pediatric Onco-Hematologic Clinic were retrospectively reviewed. Average age at diagnosis was 6.6 years (from 7 months to 17 years). Seventy-three (60%) were boys and adolescent boys, 49 (40%) were girls and adolescent girls. One hundred two (83.6%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 20 (16.4%) had acute myeloid leukemia. The mean follow-up was 8.2 years for the 104 survivors and 2.5 years for the 18 nonsurvivors. The chi2 test was used to perform the statistical analyses. RESULTS: At presentation, complaints related to the musculoskeletal system were frequent (38.3%), including pain (34.4%), functional impairment (22.9%), limping (12.3%), swelling (10.6%), and joint effusion (5.7%). At presentation, 40.2% of children had at least 1 radiographic abnormality. In order, they were osteolysis (13.1%), metaphyseal bands (9.8%), osteopenia (9%), osteosclerosis (7.4%), permeative pattern (5.7%), pathological fractures (5.7%), periosteal reactions (4.1%), and mixed lysis-sclerosis lesions (2.5%). Different from previous reports, late radiographic lesions were uncommon (5.7%), probably because of milder newer medication protocols. They included avascular necrosis (3.3%), vertebral collapses (1.6%), and osteolysis (0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Both clinical and radiological changes had various and no uniform localization. Poor correlation was found between symptoms and radiological lesions. Survival rates in children with AL were 95.8% at 1 year, 89.6% at 3 years, 85.8% at 5 years, and 83.4% at 10 and at 13 years. Radiographic abnormalities (P = 0.400), type of leukemia (P = 0.291), sex (P = 0.245), and white blood cell count at presentation (P = 0.877) were not prognostic factors. The presence of multiple bone lesions did not affect the survival rate (P=0.632). As early diagnosis significantly decreases morbidity and mortality of AL, the orthopaedist should suspect AL in any child with unexplained persistent skeletal pain or radiographic alterations. Accurate history, general physical examination, and complete blood cell count tests should address the suspicion, which is confirmed by a peripheral and/or iliac crest bone marrow biopsy.","['Sinigaglia, Riccardo', 'Gigante, Cosimo', 'Bisinella, Gianluca', 'Varotto, Stefania', 'Zanesco, Luigi', 'Turra, Sisto']","['Sinigaglia R', 'Gigante C', 'Bisinella G', 'Varotto S', 'Zanesco L', 'Turra S']","['Sandro Agostini Spine Surgery Unit, Padua University Hospital, Padua, Italy. riccardo.sinigaglia@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Orthop,Journal of pediatric orthopedics,8109053,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/BPO.0b13e31815ff350 [doi]', '01241398-200801000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Orthop. 2008 Jan-Feb;28(1):20-8. doi: 10.1097/BPO.0b13e31815ff350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes encoding cdks involved in G1-S progression are often amplified in B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic activity of the cdk2 inhibitor CVT-313 against several human DLBCL cells. Treatment of DLBCL cells with CVT-313 resulted in apoptosis. CVT-313 treatment reduced cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) on T821, but did not affect cyclin D-cdk4/6-mediated Rb phosphorylation on S807/811. Depletion of endogenous cdk2 by short interfering (si)RNA also resulted in apoptosis in human LY3, LY8 and LY18 DLBCL cells. Importantly, inhibition of cdk2 with CVT-313 or knockdown of endogenous cdk2 with siRNA resulted in down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic factor Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), suggesting that decreased levels of cellular Mcl-1 contribute to apoptosis. In support of this, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mcl-1 was sufficient to induce apoptosis in LY3 and LY18 DLBCL. Further, cdk2 inhibition led to decreased Mcl-1 mRNA levels, which was proceeded by reduced phosphorylation of serine 2 on the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. Taken together, these data suggest that cdk2 activity is necessary for the survival of human DLBCL.","['Faber, Anthony C', 'Chiles, Thomas C']","['Faber AC', 'Chiles TC']","['Department of Biology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02467, USA. faberan@bc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'T5490K8I7S (CVT 313)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['4994 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.23.4994 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Dec 1;6(23):2982-9. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.23.4994.,,,['AI-49994/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry plays the main role in the lineage assignment; however, few studies have been done to determine the optimal set of markers. In this regard, we tried to find out the optimal first-line set of markers with a minimal compromise in its diagnostic sensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 321 cases of acute leukemias whose diagnoses were based on the EGIL (European Group for Immunological Classification of Acute Leukemia) scores. At our institution, flow cytometic analyses included 15 first-line markers and 4 additional second-line markers as needed, along with immunohistochemical stains. We performed simulational studies for the expected EGIL scores involving every possible combination of markers and analyzing the overall diagnostic sensitivities in each combination. RESULTS: The cytoplasmic antigens including MPO stain and CD79a stain contributed greatly to the lineage assignment. For a sensitivity over 95%, there needed a combination of MPO stain with other 5 flow markers (CD33, CD13, CD14, CD15 and CD117) for myeloid lineage; CD79a stain with 3 flow markers [CD19, CD10, and CD20 (or TdT)] for B-lymphoid lineage; and 4 flow markers (CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7) for T-lymphoid lineage. CONCLUSIONS: To maintain diagnostic sensitivities over 95% for each lineage, at least 14 markers (including MPO stain and CD79a stain) were needed; while 16 markers were needed for a sensitivity of 100%. When combined with other important markers for specific aims such as CD45, the minimum number of markers needed for the accurate diagnosis of acute leukemias would be more than about 18 to 20.","['Lee, Seung Tae', 'Kim, Hee Jin', 'Kim, Sun Hee']","['Lee ST', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. sunnyhk@smc.samsung.co.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,,,2007/12/25 09:00,2007/12/25 09:01,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/25 09:01 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['200612393 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2006.26.6.393 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2006 Dec;26(6):393-9. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2006.26.6.393.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analyzed the usage of irradiated blood components in Hanyang University Medical Center. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for 187 patients who had been transfused with irradiated blood products during the period from January 2004 to June 2005. And we investigated the proportion of irradiated blood products among the total number of blood products that were transfused during a one-year period. RESULTS: Hematologic diseases and solid cancer patients comprised 63.7% and 24.6% respectively. The proportion of irradiated blood products among the total blood components were 25.7% of platelet concentrates, 61.4% of apheresis platelets, and 5.1% of packed red cells. Total transfused amount by disease categories and the average transfused units per patient of irradiated blood components were high in a group of patients with several hematologic diseases such as acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The use of irradiated blood components takes a great proportion in total blood product transfusions and the majority of blood components were transfused to a group of patients with a few hematologic diseases.

Now, a few cases of AMoL with a similar translocation have been reported in the literature, and these cases emphasize the importance of cytogenetic and FISH studies in addition to morphology, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype in classifying acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","['Kim, Kyong Eun', 'Kim, Sung Hyun', 'Han, Jin Yeong']","['Kim KE', 'Kim SH', 'Han JY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,,,2007/12/25 09:00,2007/12/25 09:01,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/25 09:01 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['200610329 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2006.26.5.329 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2006 Oct;26(5):329-33. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2006.26.5.329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations are known to cause the proliferation of leukemic cells and inhibit the apoptosis of leukemic cells due to ligand-independent activation of their receptors. Therefore, the current study attempted to investigate the frequency of FLT3 gene mutations and their prognostic implications for AML in terms of treatment response, survival, and relapse. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect D835 and ITD mutations in 84 newly diagnosed AML patients from February 2001 to October 2004. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct sequencing were performed to analyze the D835 mutations. The results were examined based on a comparison with previously known prognostic factors, and the treatment outcomes analyzed according to the existence of the mutations in relation to the event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complete remission (CR) rates. RESULTS: D835 and IDT mutations were detected in 4.7% (4/84) and 19.0% (16/84), respectively, of the AML patients. The FLT3 gene mutations were not found to be associated with previously known prognostic factors, such as the WBC count, age, and cytogenetic risk group, but were associated with the lactate dehydrogenase levels. The EFS and OS rates were also significantly lower in the FLT3 gene mutation group, especially in AML with normal karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3 gene mutations were observed in 23.8% of AML patients and appeared to have a prognostic implication on patient survival. Accordingly, the presence of FLT3 gene mutations, which could be tested easily by using PCR/RFLP methods, should be investigated routinely at the time of diagnosis.","['Chang, Soon Hee', 'Lee, Nan Young', 'Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Suh, Jang Soo']","['Chang SH', 'Lee NY', 'Kim DH', 'Sohn SK', 'Suh JS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Daegu Fatima Hospital, Daegu, Korea. suhjs@mail.knu.ac.kr.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,,,2007/12/25 09:00,2007/12/25 09:01,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/25 09:01 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['200608233 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2006.26.4.233 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2006 Aug;26(4):233-40. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2006.26.4.233.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The frequency of NQO1 polymorphism was investigated in 117 myeloma patients and 166 controls. NQO1 genetic polymorphism was determined by TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Prognostic factors were obtained from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: The frequencies of the NQO1*1/*1, *1/*2, and *2/*2 genotypes were 31.6%, 63.2%, and 5.1% in the patients, whereas the respective figures in the controls were 31.9%, 48.3%, and 19,9%.

Evaluable cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were available in 140 (70%) patients. Four karyotype categories (normal [n = 31, 22%], t(9;22)/BCR/ABL1 [n = 36, 26%], other unfavorable [-7, +8, or 11q23 rearrangement, n = 19, 13%], and miscellaneous [n = 54, 39%]) and the biologically and clinically relevant ALL ploidy subgroups were prospectively defined. Overall survival (OS) decreased significantly with increasing age (P = .009) and varied with karyotype category (P < .001). OS was worst for t(9;22)/BCR/ABL1 followed by other unfavorable karyotypes, with hazard ratios (HR) of 3.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.88-6.31) and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.04-4.04), respectively, compared with normal diploid group. OS of the miscellaneous group was similar to that of the normal diploid group (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.44-1.53). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was not significantly associated with age (P = .30) but was heterogeneous among karyotype categories (P < .001) primarily because of poor RFS in t(9;22)/BCR/ABL1 (HR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.80-6.75) compared with the normal diploid group. After accounting for the variation among karyotype groups, age was not a significant prognostic factor for OS or RFS, highlighting cytogenetics as the most important prognostic factor in adult ALL.

However, their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of one of the main olive oil phenols, hydroxytyrosol [3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (3,4-DHPEA)], on proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation of HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. 3,4-DHPEA showed a potent inhibitory activity on DNA synthesis, as evidenced by a 92% reduction of [3H]-thymidine incorporation at 100 micromol/L, and an induced apoptosis, as evidenced by the release of cytosolic nucleosomes and flow cytometry. This phenol, 3,4-DHPEA, was also able to inhibit the progression of the cell cycle in synchronized HL60 cells, which accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle after 25 h of treatment. Furthermore, 3,4-DHPEA induced differentiation on HL60 cells with a maximum effect (22% of cells) at 100 micromol/L after 72 h of treatment. Among the different proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, 3,4-DHPEA reduced the level of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 6 and increased that of cyclin D3. With regard to the CDK inhibitors, p15 was not altered by 3,4-DHPEA treatment, whereas the expression of p21(WAF1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) was increased at both protein and mRNA levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that 3,4-DHPEA may effect the expression of genes involved in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.","['Fabiani, Roberto', 'Rosignoli, Patrizia', 'De Bartolomeo, Angelo', 'Fuccelli, Raffaela', 'Morozzi, Guido']","['Fabiani R', 'Rosignoli P', 'De Bartolomeo A', 'Fuccelli R', 'Morozzi G']","['Dipartimento di Specialita Medico-Chirurgiche e Sanita Pubblica, Sezione di Epidemiologia Molecolare ed Igiene Ambientale, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Perugia 06126, Italy. fabirob@unipg.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '10597-60-1 (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'ML9LGA7468 (Phenylethyl Alcohol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/01/18 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['138/1/42 [pii]', '10.1093/jn/138.1.42 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2008 Jan;138(1):42-8. doi: 10.1093/jn/138.1.42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the following: (i) the effects of moderately high folic acid supplementation on the course of liver impairment in CCl(4)-treated rats and (ii) the influence of folic acid supplements on the hepatic recovery following the interruption of the CCl(4)-induced toxic injury. Four experimental groups of rats were used: CCl(4)-treated rats (0.5 ml of CCl(4) twice a week i.p.) fed standard chow for up to 12 weeks (Group A); treated rats fed chow supplemented with 25 mg/kg folic acid from weeks 6 to 12 (Group B); treated rats fed a standard diet but with CCl(4) discontinued after 6 weeks to allow for tissue recovery over 4 weeks (Group C); rats as Group C but fed a diet supplemented with 25 mg/kg folic acid from weeks 6 to 10 (Group D). Liver and blood samples were obtained for biochemical, histological, and gene expression analyses. Animals that received the supplement had a higher content of collagen, activated stellate cells, and apoptotic parenchymal cells in biopsy tissue at weeks 8 and 10 of treatment and more extensive alterations in serum albumin and bilirubin concentrations (Group B vs. Group A). In some of the time periods analyzed, alterations were observed in the expression of genes related to apoptosis (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, inhibitor of apoptosis 2) and to fibrosis (procollagen I, matrix metalloproteinase 7). In the recovery period (Groups C and D), folic acid administration was associated with increased hepatic inflammation and apoptosis and with a decrease in the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 expression following 1 week of recovery. We conclude that folic acid administration aggravates the development of fibrosis in CCl(4)-treated rats. Follow-up studies are needed to determine whether folic acid treatment would be contraindicated in patients with chronic liver diseases.","['Marsillach, Judit', 'Ferre, Natalia', 'Camps, Jordi', 'Riu, Francesc', 'Rull, Anna', 'Joven, Jorge']","['Marsillach J', 'Ferre N', 'Camps J', 'Riu F', 'Rull A', 'Joven J']","['Centre de Recerca Biomedica, Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, Institut de Recerca en Ciencies de la Salut, Reus, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbon Tetrachloride', 'Folic Acid/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental/*chemically induced/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['233/1/38 [pii]', '10.3181/0703-RM-59 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2008 Jan;233(1):38-47. doi: 10.3181/0703-RM-59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients carrying the AML1-ETO fusion gene exhibit an accumulation of granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow and the blood. Here, we describe a transgenic zebrafish line that enables inducible expression of the human AML1-ETO oncogene. Induced AML1-ETO expression in embryonic zebrafish causes a phenotype that recapitulates some aspects of human AML. Using this highly tractable model, we show that AML1-ETO redirects myeloerythroid progenitor cells that are developmentally programmed to adopt the erythroid cell fate into the granulocytic cell fate. This fate change is characterized by a loss of gata1 expression and an increase in pu.1 expression in myeloerythroid progenitor cells. Moreover, we identify scl as an early and essential mediator of the effect of AML1-ETO on hematopoietic cell fate. AML1-ETO quickly shuts off scl expression, and restoration of scl expression rescues the effects of AML1-ETO on myeloerythroid progenitor cell fate. These results demonstrate that scl is an important mediator of the ability of AML1-ETO to reprogram hematopoietic cell fate decisions, suggesting that scl may be an important contributor to AML1-ETO-associated leukemia. In addition, treatment of AML1-ETO transgenic zebrafish embryos with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, restores scl and gata1 expression, and ameliorates the accumulation of granulocytic cells caused by AML1-ETO. Thus, this zebrafish model facilitates in vivo dissection of AML1-ETO-mediated signaling, and will enable large-scale chemical screens to identify suppressors of the in vivo effects of AML1-ETO.","['Yeh, Jing-Ruey J', 'Munson, Kathleen M', 'Chao, Yvonne L', 'Peterson, Quinn P', 'Macrae, Calum A', 'Peterson, Randall T']","['Yeh JR', 'Munson KM', 'Chao YL', 'Peterson QP', 'Macrae CA', 'Peterson RT']","['Developmental Biology Laboratory, Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA. jyeh1@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (gata1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cardiovascular System/cytology/drug effects/embryology/metabolism', '*Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic System/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['135/2/401 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.008904 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2008 Jan;135(2):401-10. doi: 10.1242/dev.008904.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This technique is useful in monitoring patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the same approach can be used in other translocations and has the potential of multiplexing.","['Jilani, Iman', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Faraji, Homan', 'Gorre, Mercedes', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Bhalla, Kapil', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Jilani I', 'Kantarjian H', 'Faraji H', 'Gorre M', 'Cortes J', 'Ottmann O', 'Bhalla K', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, 33608 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071226,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoassay/methods', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00458-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jun;32(6):936-43. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.023.

In this study, we investigated the ability of the CD7(+)CD34(-) population to differentiate into natural killer and dendritic cells (DCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CB CD34(+) cells were expanded over a mesenchymal stem cell layer in serum-free medium supplemented with stem cell factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitor factor, and Flt-3 ligand for 2 weeks. Cultured cells were harvested and CD7(+)CD34(-)Lin(-) cells sorted and plated for 2 additional weeks in either natural killer- or DC-inductive medium. RESULTS: Culture of CD34(+) cells for the first 2 weeks in this system resulted in expansion of the stem cell pool and the myeloid component of the graft, and also produced a 58-fold increase in the CD7(+)CD34(-) cell population. When sorted CD7(+)CD34(-)Lin(-) cells were induced toward a natural killer cell phenotype, further expansion was observed during this time in culture, and differentiation was confirmed by cytotoxic activity and by flow cytometry, with cells displaying CD16 and CD56 in the absence of CD3. Generation of DC cells in culture was also verified by observing both the characteristic dendritic morphology and the dendritic phenotypes HLA-DR(bright)CD123(bright)CD11c(-) and HLA-DR(bright)CD11c(+). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the ability of an ex vivo culture system to drive expansion of human CB hematopoietic stem cells, while promoting the immune maturation of the graft and generation of DC and natural killer cells that could then be utilized for adoptive cancer cellular immunotherapy.","['Frias, Ana M', 'Porada, Christopher D', 'Crapnell, Kirsten B', 'Cabral, Joaquim M S', 'Zanjani, Esmail D', 'Almeida-Porada, Graca']","['Frias AM', 'Porada CD', 'Crapnell KB', 'Cabral JM', 'Zanjani ED', 'Almeida-Porada G']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of Nevada, Reno 89557-0104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00557-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Jan;36(1):61-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.08.031.,,PMC2214851,"['R01 HL070566/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073737-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL70566/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL052955-14A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL052955/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL73737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS37115'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total arsenic was determined with either flow injection-HGAFS in urine or radiochemical neutron activation analysis in blood fractions (in serum/plasma, blood cells). The total arsenic concentrations (during prolonged, daily/weekly arsenic trioxide therapy) were in the microg mL(-1) range for urine and in the ng g(-1) range for blood fractions. The main arsenic species found in urine were As(III), MA and DMA and in blood As(V), MA and DMA. With proper sample preparation and storage of urine (no preservation agents/storage in liquid nitrogen) no analytical artefacts were observed and absence of significant amounts of alleged trivalent metabolites was proven. On the contrary, in blood samples a certain amount of arsenic can get lost in the speciation procedure what was especially noticeable for the blood cells although also plasma/serum gave rise to some disappearance of arsenic. The latter losses may be attributed to precipitation of As(III)-containing proteins/peptides during the methanol/water extraction procedure whereas the former losses were due to loss of specific As(III)-complexing proteins/peptides (e.g. cysteine, metallothionein, reduced GSH, ferritin) on the column (Hamilton PRP-X100) during the separation procedure. Contemporary analytical protocols are not able to completely avoid artefacts due to losses from the sampling to the detection stage so that it is recommended to be careful with the explanation of results, particularly regarding metabolic and pharmacokinetic interpretations, and always aim to compare the sum of species with the total arsenic concentration determined independently.","['Slejkovec, Zdenka', 'Falnoga, Ingrid', 'Goessler, Walter', 'van Elteren, Johannes T', 'Raml, Reingard', 'Podgornik, Helena', 'Cernelc, Peter']","['Slejkovec Z', 'Falnoga I', 'Goessler W', 'van Elteren JT', 'Raml R', 'Podgornik H', 'Cernelc P']","['Jozef Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia. zdenka.slejkovec@ijs.si']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071123,Netherlands,Anal Chim Acta,Analytica chimica acta,0370534,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*blood/chemistry/therapeutic use/*urine', '*Artifacts', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/drug therapy/urine', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/drug therapy/urine', 'Oxides/*blood/chemistry/therapeutic use/*urine', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2670(07)01915-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.aca.2007.11.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Chim Acta. 2008 Jan 21;607(1):83-91. doi: 10.1016/j.aca.2007.11.031.

Genotyping was performed with peripheral blood DNA for MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphisms. RESULTS: Eleven of the 48 patients (22.9%) had scores consistent with the inattentive symptoms of ADHD. Patients with genotypes related to lower folate levels (11 out of 39; 39.2%) were more likely to have ADHD. The A1298C genotype appeared to be the predominant linkage to the inattentive symptoms, leading to a 7.4-fold increase in diagnosis, compared with a 1.3-fold increase for the C677T genotype.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the application of the amelogenin gene for the assessment of chimerism in samples of patients who had received a sex-mismatched stem cell transplantation. METHODS: A polymerase chain reaction technique was developed using a set of amelogenin gene primers alone and/or in combination with short tandem repeats primers and was preformed on blood and/or bone marrow aspiration samples of 30 recipient patients after transplantation. The technique was then set up as a routine procedure, from September 2000 through April 2006, more than 1400 samples taken from 300 stem cell transplantation patients suffering from different types of leukemia and nonmalignant hematologic disorders were evaluated for detection of chimerism after transplantation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the test was as low as 1 - 2%. The ratio of X/Y fragments was as the mixed chimerism. In 90% of the patients, amelogenin marker was as informative as short tandem repeats markers, as confirmed by the clinical outcome. In 5% of the patients, when there was no pre- bone marrow transplantation sample from either donor or recipient, the applicability of this assay became crucial to our treating physicians. CONCLUSION: The application of the amelogenin marker alone or in combination with the short tandem repeats system can be used for relative quantitative analysis of mixed chimerism and for observing kinetics of engraftment in patients who have sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation. Amelogenin polymerase chain reaction analysis showed an excellent correlation with the short tandem repeats-polymerase chain reaction results.","['Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Gavamzadeh, Ardashir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran']","['Ghaffari SH', 'Chahardouli B', 'Gavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K']","['Hematology, Oncology, and BMT Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari2000@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (Amelogenin)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Amelogenin/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Markers', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/12/25 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/12/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['0010 [pii]', '08111/AIM.0010 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Iran Med. 2008 Jan;11(1):35-41. doi: 08111/AIM.0010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most intensive lysis of erythrocytes in erythroclasic clusters took place in the bone marrow of patients in an active stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Differentiation was evaluated in K562 erythroleukaemia cells by measuring haemoglobin synthesis and flow cytometric measurement of glycophorin A expression. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V-FITC and Propidium Iodide (PI) double staining assay. Apoptosis and necrosis was also evaluated morphologically using staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) by fluorescence microscopy. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) level was measured by ELISA kit. RESULTS: Hyperthermia (43 degrees C) induced differentiation as judged by increased haemoglobin synthesis and glycophorin A expression. No sign of apoptosis or necrosis could be detected at this temperature. Cell viability did not change due to heat treatment, and cellular proliferation was reduced in a dose (heating time) dependent manner. At 45 degrees C, hyperthermia induced apoptosis and necrosis with minimal or no sign of differentiation. HSP70 level was significantly increased at 43 degrees C along with differentiation of leukaemic cells, while at 45 degrees C no significant effect on HSP70 production could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: The encouraging results obtained here indicate that by heat treatment at 43 degrees C, hyperthermia can be used alone or in combination with other modalities as a differentiation inducing agent without any detectable apoptotic activity. Positive correlation between HSP70 production and induction of differentiation and lack of apoptosis by hyperthermia confirm the possible role of HSP70 in the heat-induced differentiation and apoptosis in leukaemic cells.","['Sharif-Khatibi, Leila', 'Kariminia, Amina', 'Khoei, Sameide', 'Goliaei, Bahram']","['Sharif-Khatibi L', 'Kariminia A', 'Khoei S', 'Goliaei B']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Fever/metabolism/pathology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Temperature']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['788717847 [pii]', '10.1080/02656730701769833 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 2007 Dec;23(8):645-55. doi: 10.1080/02656730701769833.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, enrollment in clinical trials remains a recommended approach for nearly all patients. While signal transduction inhibition is a promising area to advance AML therapy, no agent as monotherapy has demonstrated obvious clinical benefit over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Tipifarnib is perhaps an exception as it is the only signal transduction inhibitor in AML that reproducibly shows clinical benefit using traditional chemotherapy response criteria. Due to toxicity and low response rates, however, the potential advantages of tipifarnib over either traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy or best supportive care alone await confirmation from phase III studies. Available data suggest that combining signal transduction inhibitors with chemotherapy will improve response rates. Clinical trials to test this hypothesis are ongoing using various agents directed against targets such as FLT3, ras/raf/MAPK, mTOR, KIT, and VEGF, but the optimal approach is yet to be defined. Similarly unclear is the benefit of a potent specific kinase inhibitor versus a broad inhibitor of multiple kinases that could prove relevant to leukemia biology. In general, the incomplete understanding of many signal transduction inhibitors' true mechanism of action limits our ability to identify pretreatment predictors of response. To this end, the extensive measures applied to correlate the biologic activity of FLT3 inhibitors with clinical responses are noteworthy and provide useful lessons for clinical trial design and drug development both in leukemia and other cancers.","['Perl, Alexander E', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Perl AE', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

All patients presented lasting hematologic remission and were matched concerning age, sex and appearance of GvHD. Analysis of late transplant period (day +100) revealed a concentration of host cells within the CD34+ precursor cell compartment in both diseases. However, in IMF BM biopsies only up to 8% recipient CD34+ precursors but in CML biopsies up to 26% recipient CD34+ precursors were detected. Taken into account that in CML up to 10% of the host BM CD34+ precursors bear the BCR-ABL translocation our data suggest that the neoplastic CD34+ progenitor cell population might dispose of better strategies to escape immune surveillance in CML than in IMF.","['Siebolts, Udo', 'Thiele, Jurgen', 'Zander, Thomas', 'Ditschkowski, Markus', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia']","['Siebolts U', 'Thiele J', 'Zander T', 'Ditschkowski M', 'Beelen DW', 'Kroger N', 'Fehse B', 'Wickenhauser C']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, D-50924 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*therapy', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 Jan;19(1):287-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studies reported here have attempted to further characterize the anti-cancer activity of a mixture of steroidal saponins: balanitin-6 (28%) and balanitin-7 (72%) isolated from Balanites aegyptiaca kernels. The balanitin-6 and -7 mixture (henceforth referred to as bal6/7) has demonstrated appreciable anti-cancer effects in human cancer cell lines in vitro. Bal6/7 displayed higher anti-proliferative activity than etoposide and oxaliplatin, although the mixture was appreciably less active than SN38 and markedly less active than taxol. Bal6/7 demonstrated highest activity against A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (IC(50), 0.3 microM) and U373 glioblastoma (IC(50), 0.5 microM) cell lines. The current study has further indicated that bal6/7 is more a cytotoxic compound than a cytostatic one. However, Bal6/7 does not appear to mediate its anti-proliferative effects by inducing apoptotic cell death. Computer-assisted cellular imaging has revealed that bal6/7 does not induce detergent-like effects in A549 NSCLC and U373 glioblastoma unlike certain saponins. Furthermore there is indication that its in vitro anti-cancer activities result at least partly from depletion of [ATP]i, leading in turn to major disorganization of actin cytoskeleton, ultimately resulting in the impairment of cancer cell proliferation and migration. In contrast to a number of natural products acting as anti-cancer agents, bal6/7 does not induce an increase in intra-cellular reactive oxygen species. In vivo, bal6/7 increased the survival time of mice bearing murine L1210 leukemia grafts to the same extent reported for vincristine. These preliminary in vivo data suggest that it may be possible to generate novel hemi-synthetic derivatives of balanitin-6 and -7 with potentially improved in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity and reduced in vivo toxicity, thus markedly improving the therapeutic ratio.","['Gnoula, Charlemagne', 'Megalizzi, Veronique', 'De Neve, Nancy', 'Sauvage, Sebastien', 'Ribaucour, Fabrice', 'Guissou, Pierre', 'Duez, Pierre', 'Dubois, Jacques', 'Ingrassia, Laurent', 'Lefranc, Florence', 'Kiss, Robert', 'Mijatovic, Tatjana']","['Gnoula C', 'Megalizzi V', 'De Neve N', 'Sauvage S', 'Ribaucour F', 'Guissou P', 'Duez P', 'Dubois J', 'Ingrassia L', 'Lefranc F', 'Kiss R', 'Mijatovic T']","['Laboratoire de Chimie Bioanalytique, de Toxicologie et de Chimie Physique Appliquee, Institut de Pharmacie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), 1050 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (balanitin 6)', '0 (balanitin 7)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K49P2K8WLX (Diosgenin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Balanites/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diosgenin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/03/21 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Jan;32(1):5-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have previously demonstrated that bortezomib could also sensitize tumor cells to killing via the death ligand, TRAIL. NK cells represent a potent antitumor effector cell. Therefore, we investigated whether bortezomib could sensitize tumor cells to NK cell-mediated killing. Preincubation of tumor cells with bortezomib had no effect on short-term NK cell killing or purified granule killing assays. Using a 24-h lysis assay, increases in tumor killing was only observed using perforin-deficient NK cells, and this increased killing was found to be dependent on both TRAIL and FasL, correlating with an increase in tumor Fas and DR5 expression. Long-term tumor outgrowth assays allowed for the detection of this increased tumor killing by activated NK cells following bortezomib treatment of the tumor. In a tumor purging assay, in which tumor:bone marrow cell mixtures were placed into lethally irradiated mice, only treatment of these mixtures with a combination of NK cells with bortezomib resulted in significant tumor-free survival of the recipients. These results demonstrate that bortezomib treatment can sensitize tumor cells to cellular effector pathways. These results suggest that the combination of proteasome inhibition with immune therapy may result in increased antitumor efficacy.","['Hallett, William H D', 'Ames, Erik', 'Motarjemi, Milad', 'Barao, Isabel', 'Shanker, Anil', 'Tamang, David L', 'Sayers, Thomas J', 'Hudig, Dorothy', 'Murphy, William J']","['Hallett WH', 'Ames E', 'Motarjemi M', 'Barao I', 'Shanker A', 'Tamang DL', 'Sayers TJ', 'Hudig D', 'Murphy WJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Perforin/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/03/11 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/1/163 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.1.163 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jan 1;180(1):163-70. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.1.163.,,,"['R01CA102282-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA95327-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102282-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093527-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 15 polymorphisms in DHFR promoter were analyzed, and 3 sites (C-1610G/T, C-680A, and A-317G) were identified as sufficient to define observed haplotypes (tag single nucleotide polymorphisms [tagSNPs]). These polymorphisms were investigated for association with treatment response in 277 children with ALL. Lower event-free survival (EFS) was associated with homozygosity for the allele A-317 and C-1610 (P=.03 and .02), and with the haplotype *1, defined by both C-1610 and A-317 alleles (P=.03). The haplotype *1 conferred higher transcriptional activity (P<.01 compared with haplotypes generating minimal luciferase expression). Quantitative mRNA analysis showed higher DHFR levels for particular haplotype *1 carriers (P<.01). The analysis combining haplotype *1 with thymidylate synthase (TS) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) genotypes previously shown to affect ALL outcome showed that the number of event-predisposing genotypes was associated with increasingly lower EFS (P<.001). In conclusion, DHFR promoter polymorphisms are associated with worse ALL outcome, likely due to a higher DHFR expression. Combined effects among genes of the folate cycle can further accentuate differences in the response to the treatment.","['Dulucq, Stephanie', 'St-Onge, Genevieve', 'Gagne, Vincent', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Labuda, Damian', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Dulucq S', 'St-Onge G', 'Gagne V', 'Ansari M', 'Sinnett D', 'Labuda D', 'Moghrabi A', 'Krajinovic M']","['Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Mere-Enfant, Sainte-Justine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071220,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/mortality', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43093-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-110593 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3692-700. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-110593.

PXR promotes bile acid elimination by activating bile acid-detoxifying enzymes and transporters. Certain bile acids are known to promote colonic carcinogenesis by inducing colon cancer cell apoptosis. However, whether and how PXR plays a role in colon cancer apoptosis has not been reported. In this study, we showed that activation of PXR by genetic (using a constitutively activated PXR) or pharmacological (using PXR agonist rifampicin) means protected the PXR-overexpressing colon cancer HCT116 cells from deoxycholic acid-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, activation of PXR also protected HCT116 cells from adriamycin-induced cell death, suggesting that the antiapoptotic effect of PXR was not bile acid specific. Moreover, the antiapoptotic effect of PXR in HCT116 cells appeared to be independent of xenobiotic enzyme regulation, because these cells had little basal and inducible expression of bile acid-detoxifying enzymes. Instead, SuperArray analysis showed that PXR-mediated deoxycholic acid resistance was associated with up-regulation of multiple antiapoptotic genes, including BAG3, BIRC2, and MCL-1, and down-regulation of proapoptotic genes, such as BAK1 and TP53/p53. Treatment with rifampicin in colon cancer LS180 cells, a cell line known to express endogenous PXR, also inhibited apoptosis. Activation of PXR in transgenic mice inhibited bile acid-induced colonic epithelial apoptosis and sensitized mice to dimethylhydrazine-induced colonic carcinogenesis, suggesting that the antiapoptotic effect of PXR is conserved in normal colon epithelium. In summary, our results have established the antiapoptotic role of PXR in both human colon cancer cells and normal mouse colon epithelium.","['Zhou, Jie', 'Liu, Mingjie', 'Zhai, Yonggong', 'Xie, Wen']","['Zhou J', 'Liu M', 'Zhai Y', 'Xie W']","['Center for Pharmacogenetics, Deaprtment of Pharmaceuticals Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071220,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAG3 protein, human)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Dimethylhydrazines)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '005990WHZZ (Deoxycholic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Deoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Dimethylhydrazines/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rifampin/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/07/22 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2007-0197 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2007-0197 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2008 Apr;22(4):868-80. doi: 10.1210/me.2007-0197.

Commonly occurring conditions associated with secondary ITP include lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas), autoimmune collagen vascular diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], thyroid disease, antiphospholipid syndrome [APS]), and chronic infections (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). The mechanism of platelet destruction in thrombocytopenias associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and collagen vascular diseases is identical to the autoimmune mechanism seen in primary ITP. Drug-induced thrombocytopenias are uncommon and generally resolve quickly upon drug discontinuation, but are often attributed to other causes. Platelet destruction in infection-associated ITP occurs via various mechanisms including accelerated platelet clearance due to immune complex disease as seen in HIV infection or cross-reactivity of anti-platelet glycoprotein antibodies and viral antigens in HIV, HCV, and H pylori infections (antigenic mimicry). In patients with HCV-related cirrhotic liver disease, splenic sequestration secondary to portal hypertension and decreased production of thrombopoietin may further contribute to development of thrombocytopenia. The current treatment paradigm for secondary ITP varies according to the underlying condition. Standard treatments for primary ITP (corticosteroids, IVIG, anti-D, splenectomy) are often successful in secondary ITP.

Allelic variations of HUMTH01 are known to have a quantitative silencing effect on TH gene expression and to correlate with quantitative and qualitative changes in the binding by ZNF191. This factor has been isolated from bone marrow and promyelocytic leukemia cell lines indicating that ZNF191 also plays a role in hematopoiesis. Thus, ZNF191 could participate in the regulation of several genes implicated in different functions. Moreover, mice that are deficient in Zfp191, the murine homologue of ZNF191, have been shown to be severely retarded in development and to die approximately at embryonic day 7.5. In order to gain further insight into its biological functions, we have analysed the localisation of Zfp191 throughout mouse development. Expression was detected early during embryogenesis in ectodermal, endodermal, mesodermal and extra-embryonic tissues. In particular, Zfp191 was observed in the developing central nervous system. Interestingly, its expression levels were prominent in areas of proliferation such as the subventricular zone.

Set/TAF-Ibeta was co-precipitated with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) of these promoters in the absence of dexamethasone, while addition of the hormone caused dissociation of Set/TAF-Ibeta from and attraction of the p160-type coactivator GRIP1 to the promoter GREs. Set-Can fusion protein, on the other hand, did not interact with GR, was constitutively co-precipitated with GREs and suppressed GRIP1-induced enhancement of GR transcriptional activity and histone acetylation.

We have investigated the genotoxic effects of HNE and its regulation by cellular glutathione (GSH) levels in human erythroleukemia (K562) cells. Incubation of K562 cells with HNE (5-10 microM) significantly elicited a 3- to 5-fold increased DNA damage in a time- and dose-dependent manner as measured by comet assay. Depletion of GSH in cells by L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) significantly increased HNE-induced DNA damage, whereas supplementation of GSH by incubating the cells with GSH-ethyl ester significantly decreased HNE-induced genotoxicity. Further, overexpression of mGSTA4-4, a HNE-detoxifying GST isozyme, significantly prevented HNE-induced DNA damage in cells, and ablation of GSTA4-4 and aldose reductase with respective siRNAs further augmented HNE-induced DNA damage. These results suggest that the genotoxicity of HNE is highly dependent on cellular GSH/GST/AR levels and favorable modulation of the aldehyde detoxification system may help in controlling the oxidative stress-induced complications.","['Yadav, Umesh C S', 'Ramana, Kota V', 'Awasthi, Yogesh C', 'Srivastava, Satish K']","['Yadav UC', 'Ramana KV', 'Awasthi YC', 'Srivastava SK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-0647, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071117,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.1.1.21 (Aldehyde Reductase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Reductase/metabolism', 'Aldehydes/*toxicity', 'Comet Assay', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/metabolism/*physiology', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutagens', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2007/12/22 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2007/12/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(07)00486-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2007.10.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Mar 1;227(2):257-64. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2007.10.025.

Understanding the molecular basis of CML has led to the development of highly effective targeted therapies that block Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib, the current first-line therapy for CML, induces durable treatment responses in most patients. However, patients may develop imatinib resistance, which is often due to BCR-ABL mutations. With the availability of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, an effective therapeutic option other than stem cell transplantation is available following imatinib failure. Randomized trial data suggest that dasatinib treatment is superior to imatinib dose escalation in patients with imatinib resistance. Nilotinib, a recently approved analogue of imatinib, has also demonstrated encouraging treatment responses in patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Other agents (including bosutinib and INNO-406) are in clinical development. With the potential availability of multiple treatment options for patients with CML, it may be possible to tailor treatment according to individual patient or disease characteristics, for example, BCR-ABL mutations.

The EFSA report suggested that the lymphoma/leukemia findings were most likely explained by infection in the rat colony. The ERF has also conducted the only available long-term oral study of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE). Thus, using the EFSA report as support, some have now raised questions about the human relevance of MTBE-associated hemolymphoreticular tumors reported by the ERF in female rats as well as whether their incidence was elevated above background levels. In this report, we discuss the hypothesized mode of action (MOA) of infection-induced lymphoma and its relevance to MTBE-associated lymphomas. We address the relationship of rat strain and study duration to lymphoma susceptibility and review evidence of low background rates of this tumor in control animals at the ERF, similar survival rates for female rats at the ERF and National Toxicology Program (NTP), and chemical- and gender-specificity of tumor induction for this type of tumor in studies at the ERF. We find that the background incidence of hemolymphoreticular tumors in female rats in the MTBE study is consistent with contemporaneous studies at the ERF and that there is an exposure-related effect, which is unlikely to be due to infections. We examine more recent tumor classification schemes for lymphomas, which support the combination of lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas reported by Belpoggi et al.

This phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine the tolerability, safety, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of R-etodolac, administered orally twice a day (BID), in patients with B-CLL. Secondary objectives included evaluating clinical response, pharmacodynamic activity (reduction of lymphocytes), and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Forty-three patients were enrolled in the study. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, rash, pruritus, and headache. Increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were also observed. Adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting, although in an apparent dose-response relationship, grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicities and grade 3 skin toxicities were reported with the highest dose regimens (1,800 and 2,400 mg BID). Hematologic toxicity was rare. The MTD was determined to be 1,200 mg BID. PK results indicated that oral absorption of R-etodolac was rapid (time to maximum concentration ranged from 2 to 4 h), and the half-life ranged from 5 to 7 h. The increase in maximum concentration, however, was not proportional to the increase in dose. R-etodolac significantly reduced absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in B-CLL patients in a dose-dependent manner up to 1,800 mg BID and caused partial responses in 2 patients. Further study of R-etodolac as a possible new maintenance therapy or as a part of combination therapy of B-CLL appears warranted.","['Jensen, Markus', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Weissinger, Florian', 'Knauf, Wolfgang', 'Kimby, Eva', 'Poynton, Christopher', 'Oliff, Ira Anton', 'Rummel, Mathias J', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Jensen M', 'Engert A', 'Weissinger F', 'Knauf W', 'Kimby E', 'Poynton C', 'Oliff IA', 'Rummel MJ', 'Osterborg A']","['University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Cologne, Germany.

The risk of VTE is higher in multiple myeloma (MM) patients who receive thalidomide or lenalidomide, especially in combination with dexamethasone or chemotherapy. Various VTE prophylaxis strategies, such as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin or aspirin, have been investigated in small, uncontrolled clinical studies. This manuscript summarizes the available evidence and recommends a prophylaxis strategy according to a risk-assessment model. Individual risk factors for thrombosis associated with thalidomide/lenalidomide-based therapy include age, history of VTE, central venous catheter, comorbidities (infections, diabetes, cardiac disease), immobilization, surgery and inherited thrombophilia. Myeloma-related risk factors include diagnosis and hyperviscosity. VTE is very high in patients who receive high-dose dexamethasone, doxorubicin or multiagent chemotherapy in combination with thalidomide or lenalidomide, but not with bortezomib. The panel recommends aspirin for patients with < or = 1 risk factor for VTE. LMWH (equivalent to enoxaparin 40 mg per day) is recommended for those with two or more individual/myeloma-related risk factors. LMWH is also recommended for all patients receiving concurrent high-dose dexamethasone or doxorubicin. Full-dose warfarin targeting a therapeutic INR of 2-3 is an alternative to LMWH, although there are limited data in the literature with this strategy. In the absence of clear data from randomized studies as a foundation for recommendations, many of the following proposed strategies are the results of common sense or derive from the extrapolation of data from many studies not specifically designed to answer these questions. Further investigation is needed to define the best VTE prophylaxis.","['Palumbo, A', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Dimopoulos, M A', 'Richardson, P G', 'San Miguel, J', 'Barlogie, B', 'Harousseau, J', 'Zonder, J A', 'Cavo, M', 'Zangari, M', 'Attal, M', 'Belch, A', 'Knop, S', 'Joshua, D', 'Sezer, O', 'Ludwig, H', 'Vesole, D', 'Blade, J', 'Kyle, R', 'Westin, J', 'Weber, D', 'Bringhen, S', 'Niesvizky, R', 'Waage, A', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, M', 'Lonial, S', 'Morgan, G J', 'Orlowski, R Z', 'Shimizu, K', 'Anderson, K C', 'Boccadoro, M', 'Durie, B G', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Hussein, M A']","['Palumbo A', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Richardson PG', 'San Miguel J', 'Barlogie B', 'Harousseau J', 'Zonder JA', 'Cavo M', 'Zangari M', 'Attal M', 'Belch A', 'Knop S', 'Joshua D', 'Sezer O', 'Ludwig H', 'Vesole D', 'Blade J', 'Kyle R', 'Westin J', 'Weber D', 'Bringhen S', 'Niesvizky R', 'Waage A', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Lonial S', 'Morgan GJ', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Shimizu K', 'Anderson KC', 'Boccadoro M', 'Durie BG', 'Sonneveld P', 'Hussein MA']","['Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

To investigate novel antifungal agents, we compared 53 patients who received posaconazole salvage therapy to 52 contemporary control patients who received high-dose lipid formulation of amphotericin B (HD-LPD/AMB at > or = 7.5 mg kg(-1) per day) and 38 other control patients who received caspofungin plus HD-LPD/AMB. Patients in the three groups had similar. The overall response rate to salvage therapy was 40% for posaconazole, 8% for HD-LPD/AMB (P < or = 0.001) and 11% for combination therapy (P < 0.002). Aspergillosis contributed to the death of 40% of posaconazole group, 65% of the HD-LPD/AMB group and 68% of the combination group (P < or = 0.008).

Several chromosome 21-localized transcription factor oncogenes including ETS2 may contribute to the unique features of DS AMkL. ETS2 transcripts measured by real-time RT-PCR were 1.8- and 4.1-fold, respectively, higher in DS and non-DS megakaryoblasts than those in non-DS myeloblasts. In a doxycycline-inducible erythroleukemia cell line, K562pTet-on/ETS2, induction of ETS2 resulted in an erythroid to megakaryocytic phenotypic switch independent of GATA1 levels. Microarray analysis of doxycycline-induced and doxycycline-uninduced cells revealed an upregulation by ETS2 of cytokines (for example, interleukin 1 and CSF2) and transcription factors (for example, TAL1), which are key regulators of megakaryocytic differentiation. In the K562pTet-on/ETS2 cells, ETS2 induction conferred differences in sensitivities to ara-C and daunorubicin, depending on GATA1 levels. These results suggest that ETS2 expression is linked to the biology of AMkL in both DS and non-DS children, and that ETS2 acts by regulating expression of hematopoietic lineage and transcription factor genes involved in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and in chemotherapy sensitivities.","['Ge, Y', 'LaFiura, K M', 'Dombkowski, A A', 'Chen, Q', 'Payton, S G', 'Buck, S A', 'Salagrama, S', 'Diakiw, A E', 'Matherly, L H', 'Taub, J W']","['Ge Y', 'LaFiura KM', 'Dombkowski AA', 'Chen Q', 'Payton SG', 'Buck SA', 'Salagrama S', 'Diakiw AE', 'Matherly LH', 'Taub JW']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2/*physiology', 'Thrombopoiesis/genetics']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405066 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405066 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):521-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405066.

The guidelines proposed here are intended to contribute to the standardization of the diagnosis and treatment of these patients, and should facilitate the future development of clinical trials that could define more precisely predictive markers for histological progression or lack of response, and evaluate new drugs or treatments.","['Matutes, E', 'Oscier, D', 'Montalban, C', 'Berger, F', 'Callet-Bauchu, E', 'Dogan, A', 'Felman, P', 'Franco, V', 'Iannitto, E', 'Mollejo, M', 'Papadaki, T', 'Remstein, E D', 'Salar, A', 'Sole, F', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Thieblemont, C', 'Traverse-Glehen, A', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Coiffier, B', 'Piris, M A']","['Matutes E', 'Oscier D', 'Montalban C', 'Berger F', 'Callet-Bauchu E', 'Dogan A', 'Felman P', 'Franco V', 'Iannitto E', 'Mollejo M', 'Papadaki T', 'Remstein ED', 'Salar A', 'Sole F', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Thieblemont C', 'Traverse-Glehen A', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Coiffier B', 'Piris MA']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20071220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/blood/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods/standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenectomy', '*Splenic Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/pathology/therapy']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405068 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405068 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):487-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405068.

Using flow cytometry, we studied CECs in 128 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS patients had higher CEC levels than controls (P<0.001), and an inverse relationship was found between CECs and international prognostic scoring system risk (r=-0.55, P<0.001). There was a positive correlation between marrow microvessel density and CECs, low-risk patients showing the strongest association (r=0.62, P<0.001). We calculated a progenitor-to-mature CEC ratio, which was higher in MDS patients than in healthy subjects (P<0.001), the highest values were found at diagnosis. CECs assessed by flow cytometry positively correlated with the ability to produce endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro (ECFCs; r=0.57, P=0.021), which was significantly higher in MDS patients than in controls (P=0.011). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that a variable proportion of CECs (from 40 to 84%) carried the same chromosomal aberration as the neoplastic clone, while endothelial cells isolated from in vitro assays were negative. This study suggests that CECs reflect the abnormal angiogenesis found in MDS, especially in the early stages of the disease. The increased number of functional endothelial progenitor cells in MDS strengthens the rationale for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring a normal interaction between hematopoietic progenitors and marrow microenvironment.","['Della Porta, M G', 'Malcovati, L', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Rosti, V', 'Bonetti, E', 'Travaglino, E', 'Boveri, E', 'Galli, A', 'Boggi, S', 'Ciccone, M', 'Pramparo, T', 'Mazzini, G', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Cazzola, M']","['Della Porta MG', 'Malcovati L', 'Rigolin GM', 'Rosti V', 'Bonetti E', 'Travaglino E', 'Boveri E', 'Galli A', 'Boggi S', 'Ciccone M', 'Pramparo T', 'Mazzini G', 'Invernizzi R', 'Lazzarino M', 'Cazzola M']","['Division of Hematology, University of Pavia and Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. matteo@haematologica.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelial Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405069 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405069 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):530-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405069.

This pathway does not operate in the retinoid-maturation-resistant NB4-LR1 subclone. In this work, we show that the CD44 gene is silenced in these cells. The molecular defect involves DNA methylation of cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) island and underacetylation of histone H3 at CD44 promoter. The methylating inhibitor 5-aza-CdR and cyclic AMP (cAMP) reverse the CD44 gene silencing. Contrary to 5-aza-CdR, cAMP does not induce DNA demethylation or histone modification at the CD44 promoter, whereas an H3pS10/AcK14 dual modification is observed on a global level. cAMP also induces the expression of c-Jun transcription factor and its recruitment at the CD44 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further show the association of brahma (Brm), a subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex involved in the crosstalk between transcription and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) processing, as well as the binding of phosphorylated RNA Pol II to the proximal promoter region of CD44. Finally, our study reveals that cAMP re-establishes the CD44-mediated cell death signalling. We propose that one of the actions of cAMP in restoring normal cell phenotype of leukaemia cells may consist in a broad trans-reactivation of silenced genes, despite marked hypermethylation of their promoters, as illustrated here with CD44 re-expression.","['Abecassis, I', 'Maes, J', 'Carrier, J-L', 'Hillion, J', 'Goodhardt, M', 'Medjber, K', 'Wany, L', 'Lanotte, M', 'Karniguian, A']","['Abecassis I', 'Maes J', 'Carrier JL', 'Hillion J', 'Goodhardt M', 'Medjber K', 'Wany L', 'Lanotte M', 'Karniguian A']","['INSERM U685, IUH, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405071 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405071 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):511-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405071.

METHODS: A total of 114 cases of AML admitted at Ewha Womans University, Mokdong Hospital between March 1997 and June 2006 were included in this study. A diagnosis of AML was made based on the results of morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Among the 114 AML patients, HLA-DR antigen was not expressed in 39 (34%), including 24 non-APL (62%) and 15 APL patients (38%). The HLA-DR negative non-APL group showed higher leukocyte counts and positive rate of CD19 expression than did APL group (P<0.05). The remaining laboratory findings were not statistically different between the HLA-DR negative non-APL and APL groups. CD34 expression was more frequent in the HLA-DR positive non-APL group than in the HLA-DR negative non-APL group and APL group. Of the 24 patients with HLA-DR negative non-APL, 7 patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation and 2 patients showed morphologic features similar to those of APL. CONCLUSIONS: CD19 expression and leukocyte count may be helpful for differentiating HLA-DR negative non-APL from APL.

METHODS: WT1 gene expression was quantified by RQ-PCR in 31 patients with AML at diagnosis (27 patients) and during follow-up (29 patients) relative to ABL control gene. In four patients, the WT1 gene expression was analyzed in comparison to a second PCR marker, PML-RARA fusion transcript. Prognostic significance of WT1 gene expression was analyzed at diagnosis and at the primary CR evaluation. Longitudinal WT1 gene analysis was performed in 17 AML patients. RESULTS: At diagnosis, WT1 gene expression exceeded the control level in all of the patients. Higher levels of WT1 gene expression were not associated with shorter event free survival or overall survival at diagnosis. Higher levels of WT1 gene expression were associated with shorter event free survival after induction chemotherapy. Relapse was observed in eight of 17 patients analysed longitudinally, and an increase of WT1 gene expression preceded morphologic relapse in four patients with the fusion transcript negative. Concomitant monitoring of PML-RARA fusion transcript reveals the lack of a significant correlation withWT1 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitation of WT1 gene expression could be used for MRD monitoring of AML and for the early detection of relapse, especially in patients lacking specific molecular markers.","['Kim, Hye Ran', 'Shin, Jeong Hwan', 'Lee, Jeong Nyeo', 'Lee, Eun Yup']","['Kim HR', 'Shin JH', 'Lee JN', 'Lee EY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Busan Paik Hospital, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (PRAM1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'WT1 Proteins/*analysis/genetics']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['200710305 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.5.305 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2007 Oct;27(5):305-12. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.5.305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we determined the prevalence and prognostic significance of FLT3/ITD in adult AML patients. METHODS: This study included 52 adult de novo AML. Exon 14 and 15 of the FLT3 gene were amplified by PCR and the PCR products were analyzed by 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) and GeneMapper Software. RESULTS: FLT3/ITD was found in 15 (28.8%) of the 52 AML patients. The presence of FLT3/ITD was significantly associated with absolute leukocyte counts (P=0.002) and bone marrow blast counts (P=0.036). FLT3/ITD was also more frequent in patients with normal karyotype (7 of 18) than in those with cytogenetic aberrations (3 of 25). Patients with t (15;17) showed a higher prevalence of FLT3/ITD (2 of 7). FLT3/ITD was significantly associated with overall survival (P<0.042).

METHODS: To investigate the significance of multidrug resistance (mdr) parameters and JNK activity, bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from 52 patients with AML were analyzed. RT-PCR was performed for mdr1, mrp1, and gst pi gene expression. JNK expression and activity were measured using an immunoe- nzymatic kinase assay and a western blot method. RESULTS: High level expression of mdr1, mrp1, and gst pi mRNA was observed in 38.5%, 48.1% and 54.3% of AML cases, respectively. The remission rate was significantly low in cases with an older age (>55 yr), a high WBC count, poor chromosomal abnormalities, a high level expression of mdr1 and mrp1. The WBC count and mdr1 mRNA expression were independent predictors for the outcome to induction chemotherapy. There was a shorter duration of overall survival in the patients with an older age, a high WBC count, chromosome aberrations, high level expressions of mdr1 and mrp1 mRNA, and JNK activation. The patient's age, WBC count and chromosomal abnormalities were independent predictors for overall survivals. The majority (28/30) of AML cases did not show any levels of JNK activation except for two cases, which were associated with an extremely high WBC count, chromosomal aberration, high level expressions of mdr1, mrp1 and gst pi mRNA, and treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate the influences of mdr1 and mrp1 mRNA expression on the clinical outcome of AML to induction chemotherapy.

FRG has been proven to be associated with many etiologies such as several infectious organisms (Coxiella burnett; Epstein-Barr Virus, EBV; cytomegalovirus, CMV; and hepatitis A virus), allopurinol induced hepatitis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients diagnosed with FRG by bone marrow biopsy at a single institute between 1995 and 2004. We reviewed clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the patients, classified them by etiology, and compared prognosis of each group. RESULTS: The most common cause of FRG was acute or chronic EBV infection. Chronic or acute EBV infection was associated with 41.4% of patients (10/24). Of the remaining patients, 33.3% (8/24) were leukemia or lymphoma patients after chemotherapy, 4.2% (1/24) was a patient with hepatic failure, and 20.8% (5/24) were diagnosed as fever of unknown origin. The most common symptom and clinical finding were fever and cytopenia. EBV-associated group comprised chronic active EBV infection, EBV-associated hemophagocytic histiocytosis, acute EBV infection, EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease, and Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. The EBV-associated group showed a lower survival probability compared with the non-EBV group (P<0.05).

It causes hematological diseases by the leukemogenic mechanism that the enhancer of ribophorin I gene in 3q21 induces the transcription of ecotropic viral integration site-1 gene in 3q26. Recently, it has been proposed that the 3q21q26 syndrome may be preceded by diabetes insipidus (DI), particularly when combined with monosomy 7, and is a unique disease entity. METHODS: From May 2001 to June 2006, a total of 5 patients with hematologic malignancy were found to have 3q21q26 syndrome and monosomy 7. Laboratory findings, clinical data, and association with DI were investigated. RESULTS: The rearrangement type of 3q21q26 was inv(3)(q21q26) in four patients and t(3;3)(q21; q26) in one. These patients' French American British types were AML M1, M2, M4 and M7, showing evident dysmegakaryopoiesis. Aberrant antigenic expressions of CD7 and CD56 were observed. The platelet count was relatively high as AML. All the five patients were refractory or in early relapse. Patient 5 was diagnosed with AML M7 20 days after being diagnosed with DI. While DI was well controlled with oral desmopressin, leukemia was refractory to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the recent opinion that 3q21q26 syndrome with monosomy 7 combined with DI is a disease of unique characteristics. In the relation between DI and monosomy 7 or 3q21q26 syndrome, there has been no explanation about how acquired abnormality of hematopoietic cells affects production of DDAVP by neurohormonal cells in hypothalamus.

CONCLUSIONS: Although it does not provide the insight into the mechanisms that cause drug resistance, the MTT assay may be a useful tool in individually optimizing the chemotherapy of patients with acute leukemia.","['Jun, Kyung Ran', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Chi, Hyun Sook', 'Lee, Kyoo Hyung', 'Lee, Je Hwan', 'Choi, Seong Jun', 'Seo, Jong Jin', 'Moon, Hyung Nam', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Park, Chan Jeoung']","['Jun KR', 'Jang S', 'Chi HS', 'Lee KH', 'Lee JH', 'Choi SJ', 'Seo JJ', 'Moon HN', 'Im HJ', 'Park CJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coloring Agents', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['20070489 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.2.89 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2007 Apr;27(2):89-95. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.2.89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But tyrosine kinase, especially Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), has been implicated in myeloproliferative disorders other than chronic myeloid leukemia. We investigated the frequency of JAK2 mutation and its correlation with other clinicopathologic variables in Korean patients with ET and reactive thrombocytosis (RT). METHODS: JAK2 mutation analysis was performed on genomic DNA from bone marrow aspirates of 24 patients with ET and peripheral blood in 36 patients with RT using allele-specific PCR. RESULTS: JAK2 mutation was detected in 11 patients (46%) among the 24 patients with ET and was not found in 36 patients with RT. In patients with ET, older age and leukocytosis were related with JAK2 mutation without statistical significance (P=0.172 and 0.094, respectively). But this mutation was not correlated with sex, hemoglobin, platelet count, splenomegaly, increased cellularity of bone marrow, bone marrow fibrosis and vascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: The current observation strengthens the specific association between JAK2 mutation and ET. At the diagnosis of ET in Korean patients, identification of JAK2 mutation should be incorporated in the basis for new approaches.","['Ahn, Jeong Yeal', 'Yoo, Soo Jin', 'Bang, Soo Mee', 'Park, Pil Whan', 'Seo, Yiel Hea', 'Shin, Dong Bok', 'Lee, Jae Hoon']","['Ahn JY', 'Yoo SJ', 'Bang SM', 'Park PW', 'Seo YH', 'Shin DB', 'Lee JH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University, Incheon, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Korea', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*diagnosis/genetics']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['20070477 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.2.77 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2007 Apr;27(2):77-82. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2007.27.2.77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of sex chromosome losses in patients with hematologic diseases, comparing the characteristics between patients with sole and secondary sex chromosome losses in conjunction with other chromosomal abnormalities. METHODS: Study group included 868 patients with hematologic diseases between June 1998 and May 2006. The cells of bone marrow aspirates were processed using unstimulated culture methods such as direct, 24-hr and/or 48-hr culture. Sex chromosome losses were included in the karyotype, when X or Y chromosome loss is observed in more than 2 metaphase cells. RESULTS: The sex chromosome losses in bone marrow were found in 5.1% of the patients and 1.8% showed sex chromosome losses as a sole chromosomal abnormality. According to the disease categories, the incidences of sex chromosome losses were as follows: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 9.5%; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 0%; myelodysplastic syndrome, 6.0%; chronic myelogenous leukemia 3.6%; myeloproliferative disorders, 1.3%; multiple myeloma (MM), 13.0%; chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 0%; malignant lymphoma, 3.8%; and benign hematologic diseases 2.2%. The patients with sex chromosome losses as a sole chromosomal abnormality were all male and median age was higher than that of patients with sex chromosome losses as a secondary abnormality (64 vs. 58 yr, P=0.02). The proportion of metaphase cells with sex chromosome losses was significantly lower in patients with sex chromosome losses as a sole chromosomal abnormality (40% vs. 100%, P<0.0001). The changes of sex chromosome loss were correlated with the disease status of AML and MM. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that secondary sex chromosome losses in conjunction with other chromosomal abnormalities seem to be one of the clonal abnormalities, whereas sex chromosome losses as a sole change seem to be an aging phenomenon, but further studies are needed.","['Huh, Jungwon', 'Moon, Heewon', 'Chung, Wha Soon']","['Huh J', 'Moon H', 'Chung WS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

However, so far there is only limited evidence for the formation of a stable TM trimer during Env activation. Here we have studied the oligomer composition and stability of an intermediate and the fully activated form of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) Env. Activation of Mo-MLV Env is controlled by isomerization of its intersubunit disulfide. This results in surface subunit (SU) dissociation and TM refolding. If activation is done in the presence of an alkylator, this will modify the isomerization-active thiol in the SU of Env and arrest Env at an intermediate stage, the isomerization-arrested state (IAS) of its activation pathway. We generated IAS and fully activated Envs in vitro and in vivo and studied their states of oligomerization by two-dimensional blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE. The IAS Env was composed of trimers of SU-TM complexes, whereas the activated Env consisted of SU monomers and TM trimers. When the oligomers were subjected to mild SDS treatment the TM trimer was found to be 3.5 times more resistant than the IAS oligomer. Thus, this demonstrates that a structural conversion of TM takes place during activation, which results in the formation of a stable TM trimer.","['Sjoberg, Mathilda', 'Lindqvist, Birgitta', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Sjoberg M', 'Lindqvist B', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071219,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Biopolymers/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Isomerism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01931-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01931-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Mar;82(5):2358-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01931-07.

Interestingly, a low-pH pulse overcame the BafA1 block to JSRV infection, although this occurred only if virus-bound cells were preincubated at 37 degrees C, consistent with a very early entry event such as endocytosis being required before the low-pH-dependent step occurs.

In this study, we examined the effects of PD treatment on telomerase activity in different human leukemia cell lines. At concentrations between 10 and 20 microM, PD exerted a dose-dependent direct cytotoxic effect and inhibition of telomerase activity via downregulation of hTERT expression. Because c-Myc and Sp1 are known to directly regulate transcription of hTERT, we also evaluated the expression and DNA binding activity of these proteins. PD treatment reduced c-Myc and Sp1 protein levels and DNA binding activities in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed that PD treatment downregulates the activation of Akt, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of hTERT. We conclude that PD has direct cytotoxic effect on human leukemia cells and suppresses telomerase activity through transcriptional and posttranslational suppression of hTERT.","['Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Shin, Dong Yeok', 'Kang, Ho Sung', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Li, Wei', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Kim MO', 'Moon DO', 'Choi YH', 'Shin DY', 'Kang HS', 'Choi BT', 'Lee JD', 'Li W', 'Kim GY']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan 609-735, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'CWJ06TA2GI (platycodin D)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(07)00547-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2007.11.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Mar 8;261(1):98-107. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2007.11.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases further document t-MDS/t-AML as a complication of therapy for AML. Presence of chromosome 7 abnormalities in patients with and without prior alkylating agent therapy suggests possible association with the antimetabolite cytarabine.","['Arana-Yi, Cecilia', 'Block, Annemarie W', 'Sait, Sheila N', 'Ford, Laurie A', 'Barcos, Maurice', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Arana-Yi C', 'Block AW', 'Sait SN', 'Ford LA', 'Barcos M', 'Baer MR']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080221,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00440-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jul;32(7):1043-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.006.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 60 children/young adults transplanted because of leukaemia, various haematological disorders and inborn errors of metabolism between 1986 and 2004, with a follow-up time of 7.0 years (median, range 2-18). Clinical assessments, performed at a median age of 15.6 years (range 5.5-23.5), included an inquiry form on dry-eye symptoms, corneal status including fluorescein staining, 'break-up time' (BUT) and Schirmer test. RESULTS: A total of 37 of 60 patients had DES defined as presence of corneal epithelial lesions with a pathological BUT and/or Schirmer test. Twenty-nine had had staining <1-10% of the corneal surface while eight patients had staining > or =10-25% of the corneal surface. All 37 patients with objective signs of DES, graded and not graded, had significant associations to subjective symptoms of dry eyes including dry eyes, red eyes, ocular irritation, secretion and sensitivity to light. Frequent occasions (above median; n = 7) of high cyclosporine A trough levels above 250 ng/ml were associated significantly with DES (P = 0.002). However, there was no association between DES and conditioning with single-dose (s-TBI) or fractionated TBI (f-TBI), busulfan or other chemotherapy. There were no associations between prolonged corticosteroid treatment or chronic GVHD and DES in the present study. DES was more common in patients with malignant diseases (P = 0.02). Malignant disease increased the risk of DES in girls but not in boys. Increased age at SCT increased the risk for DES in boys but not in girls (P = 0.02). Although severe keratitis occurred in three patients, nobody suffered corneal perforation. CONCLUSION: DES with epithelial punctata keratopathy was common in children/young adults treated with SCT and more common if the patients were exposed to repeated high trough levels of cyclosporine A; however, DES was not associated with irradiation, corticosteroids or GVHD in the present study. Patients with objective DES also had subjective symptoms of dry eyes, which facilitate diagnosis. Girls with malignant diseases and boys who underwent SCT at later ages seem to demand higher attention and more frequent check-ups regarding DES. Patients with diagnosed severe DES needed frequent and continuous ophthalmological care to maintain treatment motivation.","['Fahnehjelm, Kristina Tear', 'Tornquist, Alba-Lucia', 'Winiarski, Jacek']","['Fahnehjelm KT', 'Tornquist AL', 'Winiarski J']","['Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institut, Stockholm, Sweden. kristina.fahnehjelm@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071218,England,Acta Ophthalmol,Acta ophthalmologica,101468102,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Corneal Diseases/diagnosis/etiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/chemically induced/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Sex Factors', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Tears/metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Visual Acuity']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['AOS1120 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01120.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol. 2008 May;86(3):253-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01120.x.

This paper addresses the impact of viral components stoichiometry on cell productivity and vector quality (vector stability and transduction efficiency). A strategy is proposed for the development of packaging cell lines allowing for stoichiometric optimization of viral components. This strategy is based on the introduction of a transgene in the first step of cell line development, thus making it possible to eliminate transgene limitations and therefore exploring maximal infectious productivity based on the levels of expression of Gag-Pol and envelope. The transgene can subsequently be exchanged for a gene of interest, using site-specific flipase/flipase recombination target (Flp/FRT) cassette replacement. It was observed that Gag-Pol controlled the order of magnitude of infectious titer: a small, 2-fold variation in its expression could result in a 10- to 100-fold improvement in infectious titer; the RNA transgene and envelope expression limitations had a lower impact. The ratios of retroviral components strongly affected cell productivity but did not affect vector stability; however, transduction efficiencies were affected by an imbalanced ratio of the components, resulting in the production of higher amounts of defective virus. Thus, stoichiometric optimization of viral components not only improves cell productivity but also increases vector quality.","['Carrondo, Manuel J T', 'Merten, Otto-Wilhelm', 'Haury, Matthias', 'Alves, Paula M', 'Coroadinha, Ana S']","['Carrondo MJ', 'Merten OW', 'Haury M', 'Alves PM', 'Coroadinha AS']","['Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa (IBET/ITQB/UNL), P-2781-901 Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transgenes', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion', '*Virus Assembly', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2007/12/21 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2007/12/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2007.0101 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2008 Feb;19(2):199-210. doi: 10.1089/hum.2007.0101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To determine how frequently generalized pruritus had a systemic etiology in an outpatient population seen in a dermatology department and whether any identifiable patient characteristics meant a systemic explanation of generalized pruritus was more likely. METHODS: A prospective controlled study of 55 patients with generalized pruritus and 41 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Clinical data were collected from patients and laboratory parameters investigated in both patients and healthy control subjects to determine the frequency of systemic disease in each group. RESULTS: Of 55 patients, 12 had a systemic cause of pruritus. Pruritus was the initial symptom of systemic disease in eight of these patients. The underlying diseases included hypothyroidism, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, uremia, and iron deficiency anemia. Of these, iron deficiency anemia was the most common cause. Compared with the control group, mean serum hemoglobin, iron, and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B(12)) levels in patients with generalized pruritus were lower. No other patient characteristics were statistically associated with systemic causes of pruritus. CONCLUSION: Generalized pruritus was the initial symptom of a systemic disease in 8 of 55 patients presenting to a dermatology outpatient clinic with this complaint.

(3) The decision to grant marketing authorization was based mainly on the results of a non comparative trial including 61 patients aged from 1 year to 20 years who had few if any other therapeutic options. The median survival time was 13 weeks overall, but about 70 weeks in the subgroup of children who had a full haematological response (20% of the study population). About half these latter patients were able to undergo potentially curative haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. (4) Preliminary results from another non comparative trial suggest similar efficacy. (5) Short-term adverse effects are frequent and often serious, and include gastrointestinal disorders, infections, tumour lysis syndrome, and cardiac, renal and hepatobiliary disorders. The latter effects had also occurred in animal studies. (6) These results warrant further studies, especially to identify those children most likely to benefit from clofarabine.

Exposure to chlorambucil, fludarabine, and Nutlin-3 induced p53 accumulation and variably affected cell cycle progression in SKW6.4 lymphoblastoid cells. In particular, chlorambucil induced cell cycle accumulation at the G2/M checkpoint; Nutlin-3 induced early cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint, while fludarabine showed an intermediate behavior. On the other hand, recombinant TRAIL alone did not affect cell cycle progression but induced a rapid increase of apoptosis. Analysis of the gene expression profile of the p53-transcriptional targets showed distinct features between chlorambucil, Nutlin-3 and fludarabine, which likely account for their differential effect on cell cycle in SKW6.4 cells. In particular, chlorambucil upregulated the steady-state mRNA expression of SFN/14-3-3sigma, a gene involved in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Of note, all agonists upregulated TRAIL-R2 expression in SKW6.4 cells both at the mRNA and protein levels. Consistently, pretreatment with chlorambucil, fludarabine and Nutlin-3 enhanced SKW6.4 sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.","['Barbarotto, Elisa', 'Corallini, Federica', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'Fadda, Roberto', 'Mischiati, Carlo', 'Grill, Vittorio', 'Vaccarezza, Mauro', 'Celeghini, Claudio']","['Barbarotto E', 'Corallini F', 'Rimondi E', 'Fadda R', 'Mischiati C', 'Grill V', 'Vaccarezza M', 'Celeghini C']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21649 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 May 15;104(2):595-605. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21649.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few examples are reported which show that aptamers can be internalized inside living cells for aptamer functional studies and for targeted intracellular delivery. This is mainly due to the limited number of aptamers available for cell-specific recognition, and the lack of research on their extra- and intracellular functions. One of the major difficulties in aptamers' in vivo application is that most of aptamers, unlike small molecules, cannot be directly taken up by cells without external assistance. In this work, we have studied a newly developed and cell-specific DNA aptamer, sgc8. This aptamer has been selected through a novel cell selection process (cell-SELEX), in which whole intact cells are used as targets while another related cell line is used as a negative control. The cell-SELEX enables generation of multiple aptamers for molecular recognition of the target cells and has significant advantages in discovering cell surface binding molecules for the selected aptamers. We have studied the cellular internalization of one of the selected aptamers. Our results show that sgc8 is internalized efficiently and specifically to the lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The internalized sgc8 aptamers are located inside the endosome. Comparison studies are done with the antibody for the binding protein of sgc8, PTK7 (Human protein tyrosine kinase-7) on cell surface. We also studied the internalization kinetics of both the aptamer and the antibody for the same protein on the living cell surface. We have further evaluated the effects of sgc8 on cell viability, and no cytotoxicity is observed. This study indicates that sgc8 is a promising agent for cell-type specific intracellular delivery.","['Xiao, Zeyu', 'Shangguan, Dihua', 'Cao, Zehui', 'Fang, Xiaohong', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Xiao Z', 'Shangguan D', 'Cao Z', 'Fang X', 'Tan W']","['Center for Research at the Bio/Nano Interface, Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center and UF Genetics Institute, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-7200, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/chem.200701330 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2008;14(6):1769-75. doi: 10.1002/chem.200701330.,,,"['R01 GM079359/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 NS 058185/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These factors are produced by Sertoli cells, germ cells, peritubular cells and interstitial cells, mainly Leydig cells and macrophages. The interactions and the ratio between Sertoli and germ cells in the seminiferous tubules ensure successful spermatogenesis. In order to culture spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in vitro, researchers tried to overcome some of the obstacles -- such as the low number of stem cells in the testis, absence of specific markers to identify SSCs -- in addition to difficulties in keeping the SSCs alive in culture. Recently, some growth factors important for the proliferation and differentiation of SSCs were identified, such as glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), stem cell factor (SCF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); also, markers for SSCs at different stages were reported. Therefore, some groups succeeded in culturing SSCs (under limitations), or more differentiated cells and even were able to produce in vitro germ cells from embryonic stem cells. Thus, success in culturing SSCs is dependent on understanding the molecular mechanisms behind self-renewal and differentiation. Culture of SSCs should be a good tool for discovering new therapeutic avenue for some infertile men or for patients undergoing chemotherapy/radiotherapy (pre-puberty or post-puberty).","['Huleihel, Mahmoud', 'Abuelhija, Mahmoud', 'Lunenfeld, Eitan']","['Huleihel M', 'Abuelhija M', 'Lunenfeld E']","['The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel. huleihel@bgu.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Hormones)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Hormones/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Meiosis', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Testis/cytology/embryology']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['786935818 [pii]', '10.1080/08977190701783400 [doi]']",ppublish,Growth Factors. 2007 Aug;25(4):236-52. doi: 10.1080/08977190701783400.,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, IgVH SHM analysis is not well-suited to routine use in the clinical diagnostic laboratory. ZAP70 expression is a potential surrogate for the absence of SHM. Given the current problems with the standardization of ZAP70 assessment by flow cytometry, we sought an alternative approach, using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The utility of IHC is largely restricted to tissues, precluding its routine application to most patients with CLL who are typically diagnosed based upon peripheral blood (PB) findings. Accordingly, we developed an IHC assay that can be performed on PB. Enriched PB mononuclear cells from 29 patients with CLL were analyzed for ZAP70 expression by IHC on paraffin-embedded cell blocks, using standard techniques. IgVH SHM analysis was performed on all cases, and clinical features recorded. Seventeen specimens (59%) were negative for ZAP70 expression and 12 (41%) were positive for ZAP70 expression. SHM was evident in 20 specimens (69%), and absent in 9 (31%). Seventy-six percent of the specimens (22/29) displayed ""concordant"" ZAP70 and SHM results, in that 15 (52%) were SHM-positive/ZAP70 negative, whereas 7 (24%) were SHM-negative/ZAP70 positive. ZAP70 expression in this small cohort correlated with poor clinical outcome. Importantly, IHC analysis of ZAP70 in PB is a simple, reliable, robust assay that may have a valuable role in the routine clinical laboratory assessment of patients with CLL.","['Roullet, Michele', 'Sargent, Rachel', 'Pasha, Theresa', 'Cajiao, Isabela', 'Elstrom, Rebecca', 'Smith, Treasa', 'Liebhaber, Stephen', 'Zhang, Paul', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Roullet M', 'Sargent R', 'Pasha T', 'Cajiao I', 'Elstrom R', 'Smith T', 'Liebhaber S', 'Zhang P', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*analysis']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/02/09 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.pai.0000213152.41440.34 [doi]', '00129039-200712000-00018 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2007 Dec;15(4):471-6. doi: 10.1097/01.pai.0000213152.41440.34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Families were recruited when children with cancer were 8 to 15 years old and receiving initial treatment for a malignancy that did not primarily affect the central nervous system (CNS). At that time, each child with cancer was matched to a classmate of similar age, gender, and race for inclusion in a comparison group. For the current follow-up (7.29 years postdiagnosis), 56 survivors, 60 peers, and their parents completed questionnaires soon after the youth's 18th birthday. Severity of treatment and late effects were rated by healthcare providers. RESULTS: Survivors and peers were similar on a variety of outcomes, including family background, scholastic and occupational self-concept, and academic competence. However, survivors were more likely to report repeating a grade and having more school absences. The proportion of participants who graduated from high school, were working, and expressed plans to attend postsecondary education or seek employment were similar between groups. Initial treatment intensity, time since diagnosis, and severity of late effects were associated with several indices of educational and occupational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being more likely to repeat a grade and miss school, survivors of nonCNS cancer were similar to peers on most educational and occupational outcomes during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Interventions to assist academic or occupational functioning may not be necessary for all survivors, but additional research is needed to identify subgroups at risk for difficulties.","['Gerhardt, Cynthia A', 'Dixon, Meredith', 'Miller, Kimberly', 'Vannatta, Kathyrn', 'Valerius, Kristin S', 'Correll, Judy', 'Noll, Robert B']","['Gerhardt CA', 'Dixon M', 'Miller K', 'Vannatta K', 'Valerius KS', 'Correll J', 'Noll RB']","['Center for Biobehavioral Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. cynthia.gerhardt@nationwidechildrens.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Dev Behav Pediatr,Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,8006933,,IM,"['Absenteeism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Career Choice', '*Educational Status', '*Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Learning Disabilities/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Leukemia/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Peer Group', 'Personality Assessment', 'Reference Values', '*Rehabilitation, Vocational', 'Self Concept', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Wechsler Scales']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/DBP.0b013e31811ff8e1 [doi]', '00004703-200712000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,J Dev Behav Pediatr. 2007 Dec;28(6):448-55. doi: 10.1097/DBP.0b013e31811ff8e1.,,,,,['J Dev Behav Pediatr. 2007 Dec;28(6):473-4.

In view of the fact that transplant recipients are living longer, it is of paramount importance that we continue to translate discoveries at the bench to the bedside and document cancers in the posttransplant recipient registries. Analysis of data will help in optimizing patient management. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence indicates that sirolimus is associated with a decreased incidence of posttransplant de-novo cancer and remission of Kaposi's sarcoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to have an antiproliferative activity against leukemia and lymphoma and an anti-tumor effect against colon and prostate cancer. Clinically it has been shown to be associated with a reduced incidence of cancers like posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

However, prognosis after relapse continues to be poor. We examined postrelapse outcomes of children initially treated on the Children's Cancer Group CCG-1952 study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated outcomes after bone marrow (BM) relapse and isolated extramedullary (EM) relapse for 347 patients with SR-ALL (WBC < 50,000/microL; age, 1 to 9 years). The prognostic significance of several factors for EFS after relapse (EFS2) was assessed by Cox regression analysis. Stem-cell transplant (SCT) was compared with chemotherapy as salvage treatment. RESULTS: The mean +/- SE times to isolated central nervous system relapse, BM relapse, and isolated testicular relapse were 23 +/- 1 months (range, 1 to 88 months), 36 +/- 1 months (range, 2 to 79 months), and 40 +/- 2 months (range, 16 to 64 months), respectively. The estimated percent +/- SE 3-year EFS2 and overall survival rates after BM relapse were 37% +/- 4% and 46% +/- 4%, respectively, and rates after isolated EM relapse were 57% +/- 5% and 71% +/- 5%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, we found the duration of first remission to be the most significant predictor of EFS2 for either BM relapse or isolated EM relapse. Outcome was equivalent with SCT or chemotherapy after early or late relapse of SR-ALL at any site. CONCLUSION: Duration of first remission remains the most significant predictor of outcome after either BM or isolated EM relapse of SR-ALL. Prognosis after early BM relapse remains poor and is not improved with SCT in this cohort.","['Malempati, Suman', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Sather, Harland', 'La, Mei K', 'Stork, Linda C']","['Malempati S', 'Gaynon PS', 'Sather H', 'La MK', 'Stork LC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, CDRC-P, Portland, OR 97239-3098, USA. malempat@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/01/01 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/36/5800 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.10.7508 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 20;25(36):5800-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.10.7508.,,,"['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Curr Oncol Rep. 2008 Nov;10(6):451-2.

In previous studies, we found that ICSBP activated transcription of the gene encoding gp91(PHOX) (the CYBB gene), a rate-limiting component of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase expressed exclusively after the promyelocyte stage of myelopoiesis. Previously, we found that CYBB transcription was dependent on phosphorylation of specific ICSBP tyrosine residues. Since ICSBP is tyrosine-phosphorylated during myelopoiesis, this provided a mechanism of differentiation stage-specific CYBB transcription. In the current studies, we found that ICSBP was a substrate for Src homology-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2-PTP) in immature myeloid cells but not during myelopoiesis. Therefore, SHP2-PTP inhibited CYBB transcription and respiratory burst activity in myeloid progenitor cells by dephosphorylating ICSBP. In contrast, we found that ICSBP was a substrate for a leukemia-associated, constitutively active mutant form of SHP2, described previously, throughout differentiation. Consistent with this, constitutive SHP2 activation blocked ICSBP-induced CYBB transcription and respiratory burst activity in differentiating myeloid cells. ICSBP-deficiency and constitutive SHP2 activation have been described in human myelodysplastic syndromes. As these two abnormalities may coexist, our results identified a potential molecular mechanism for impaired phagocyte function in this malignant myeloid disease.","['Zhu, Chunliu', 'Lindsey, Stephan', 'Konieczna, Iwonna', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Zhu C', 'Lindsey S', 'Konieczna I', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 710 N.

To determine the optimal dose of MTX in childhood relapsed ALL, the ALL Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ALL-REZ BFM) Study Group performed this prospective randomized study. A total of 269 children with a first early/late isolated (n = 156) or combined (n = 68) bone marrow or any isolated extramedullary relapse (n = 45) of precursor B-cell (PBC) ALL (excluding very early marrow relapse within 18 months after initial diagnosis) were registered at the ALL-REZ BFM90 trial and randomized to receive methotrexate infusions at either 1 g/m(2) over 36 hours (intermediate dose, ID) or 5 g/m(2) over 24 hours (high dose, HD) during 6 (or 4) intensive polychemotherapy courses. Intensive induction/consolidation therapy was followed by cranial irradiation, and by conventional-dose maintenance therapy. Fifty-five children received stem-cell transplants.

The two different forms of FasL are reported to have opposite functions-membrane-bound FasL (mFasL) is proinflammatory and soluble FasL (sFasL) is antiinflammatory. We previously showed that, within the immune-privileged eye, tumors expressing high levels of mFasL overcame the suppressive ocular environment, triggered an inflammatory response, and were subsequently rejected. By contrast, eye tumors expressing low levels of mFasL grew progressively. To evaluate the effect of sFasL on the tumor growth and metastatic potential of ocular FasL-expressing tumors, we compared tumor cell clones that expressed equal amounts of (low) mFasL in the presence or absence of sFasL. Tumor cells transfected with a modified FasL gene expressed only mFasL (noncleavable), grew progressively within the eye, and induced systemic protective immunity that prevented metastatic spread of tumor cells to the liver. Unexpectedly, tumors transfected with wild-type FasL (wtFasL; cleavable), which could produce both sFasL and mFasL, elicited considerably more inflammation and grew more slowly within the eye. However, the cleavable wtFasL eye tumors failed to trigger protective immunity and gave rise to liver metastases. Interestingly, exposure to the ocular environment was required for the wtFasL tumors to gain metastatic potential. We conclude that the fate of FasL-expressing tumors is determined by a combination of the following: (a) the relative proportion of membrane and sFasL, and (b) the local environment that determines the extent of FasL cleavage.","['Gregory, Meredith S', 'Saff, Rebecca R', 'Marshak-Rothstein, Ann', 'Ksander, Bruce R']","['Gregory MS', 'Saff RR', 'Marshak-Rothstein A', 'Ksander BR']","['The Schepens Eye Research Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Eye Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Inflammation/immunology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*prevention & control', 'Transfection']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/24/11951 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0780 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 15;67(24):11951-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0780.,,,"['F32-EY13664/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA90691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY016145/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY08122/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 80% of ATLL patients develop humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM), a life-threatening complication leading to a poor prognosis. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) are important factors in the pathogenesis of HHM in ATLL and the expression of PTHrP can be activated by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in ATLL cells and is essential for leukemogenesis including transformation of lymphocytes infected by HTLV-1. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of NF-kappaB disruption by a proteasomal inhibitor (PS-341) and osteoclastic inhibition by zoledronic acid (Zol) on the development of ATLL and HHM using a novel bioluminescent mouse model. We found that PS-341 decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and down-regulated PTHrP expression in ATLL cells in vitro. To investigate the in vivo efficacy, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were xenografted with ATLL cells and treated with vehicle control, PS-341, Zol, or a combination of PS-341 and Zol. Bioluminescent imaging and tumor cell count showed a significant reduction in tumor burden in mice from all treatment groups. All treatments also significantly reduced the plasma calcium concentrations. Zol treatment increased trabecular bone volume and decreased osteoclast parameters. PS-341 reduced PTHrP and MIP-1 alpha expression in tumor cells in vivo. Our results indicate that both PS-341 and Zol are effective treatments for ATLL and HHM, which are refractory to conventional therapy.","['Shu, Sherry T', 'Nadella, Murali V P', 'Dirksen, Wessel P', 'Fernandez, Soledad A', 'Thudi, Nanda K', 'Werbeck, Jillian L', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Rosol, Thomas J']","['Shu ST', 'Nadella MV', 'Dirksen WP', 'Fernandez SA', 'Thudi NK', 'Werbeck JL', 'Lairmore MD', 'Rosol TJ']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HTLV-I Infections/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protease Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/therapeutic use']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/24/11859 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1701 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 15;67(24):11859-66. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1701.,,PMC2832603,"['T32 RR007073-07/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 RR007073-06/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 RR007073/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 RR000168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K26 RR000168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR007073/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS94364'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these phosphorylation sites (mouse Ser(18) and human Ser(15)) is a substrate for the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATM-related (ATR) protein kinases. Studies of p53(S18A) mice (with a germ-line mutation that replaces Ser(18) with Ala) have indicated that ATM/ATR phosphorylation of p53 Ser(18) is required for normal DNA damage-induced PUMA expression and apoptosis but not for DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. Unlike p53-null mice, p53(S18A) mice did not succumb to early-onset tumors. This finding suggested that phosphorylation of p53 Ser(18) was not required for p53-dependent tumor suppression. Here we report that the survival of p53(S18A) mice was compromised and that they spontaneously developed late-onset lymphomas (between ages 1 and 2 years). These mice also developed several malignancies, including fibrosarcoma, leukemia, leiomyosarcoma, and myxosarcoma, which are unusual in p53 mutant mice. Furthermore, we found that lymphoma development was linked with apoptotic defects. In addition, p53(S18A) animals exhibited several aging-associated phenotypes early, and murine embryonic fibroblasts from these animals underwent early senescence in culture. Together, these data indicate that the ATM/ATR phosphorylation site Ser(18) on p53 contributes to tumor suppression in vivo.","['Armata, Heather L', 'Garlick, David S', 'Sluss, Hayla K']","['Armata HL', 'Garlick DS', 'Sluss HK']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Atr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', '*Serine', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/24/11696 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1610 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 15;67(24):11696-703. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1610.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activating RAS mutations and overexpression of BCL-2 are prognostic features of MDS/AML transformation. Using NRASD12 and BCL-2, we created two distinct models of MDS and AML, where human (h)BCL-2 is conditionally or constitutively expressed. Our novel transplantable in vivo models show that expression of hBCL-2 in a primitive compartment by mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat results in a disease resembling human MDS, whereas the myeloid MRP8 promoter induces a disease with characteristics of human AML. Expanded leukemic stem cell (Lin(-)/Sca-1(+)/c-Kit(+)) populations and hBCL-2 in the increased RAS-GTP complex within the expanded Sca-1(+) compartment are described in both MDS/AML-like diseases. Furthermore, the oncogenic compartmentalizations provide the proapoptotic versus antiapoptotic mechanisms, by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT signaling, in determination of the neoplastic phenotype. When hBCL-2 is switched off with doxycycline in the MDS mice, partial reversal of the phenotype was observed with persistence of bone marrow blasts and tissue infiltration as RAS recruits endogenous mouse (m)BCL-2 to remain active, thus demonstrating the role of the complex in the disease. This represents the first in vivo progression model of MDS/AML dependent on the formation of a BCL-2:RAS-GTP complex. The colocalization of BCL-2 and RAS in the bone marrow of MDS/AML patients offers targeting either oncogene as a therapeutic strategy.","['Omidvar, Nader', 'Kogan, Scott', 'Beurlet, Stephanie', 'le Pogam, Carole', 'Janin, Anne', 'West, Robert', 'Noguera, Maria-Elena', 'Reboul, Murielle', 'Soulie, Annie', 'Leboeuf, Christophe', 'Setterblad, Niclas', 'Felsher, Dean', 'Lagasse, Eric', 'Mohamedali, Azim', 'Thomas, N Shaun B', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Pla, Marika', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Weissman, Irving', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Padua, Rose Ann']","['Omidvar N', 'Kogan S', 'Beurlet S', 'le Pogam C', 'Janin A', 'West R', 'Noguera ME', 'Reboul M', 'Soulie A', 'Leboeuf C', 'Setterblad N', 'Felsher D', 'Lagasse E', 'Mohamedali A', 'Thomas NS', 'Fenaux P', 'Fontenay M', 'Pla M', 'Mufti GJ', 'Weissman I', 'Chomienne C', 'Padua RA']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U718 and 728, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot, Faculte de Medicine, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie-IFR105, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', '*Genes, bcl-2', '*Genes, ras', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Spleen']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/24/11657 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0196 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 15;67(24):11657-67. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0196.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MUC1 heterodimeric protein is aberrantly overexpressed in diverse human carcinomas. The present studies show that MUC1 is expressed in the human K562 and KU812 CML cell lines. The results show that MUC1 associates with Bcr-Abl through a direct interaction between the Bcr N-terminal region and the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain. Stable silencing of MUC1 decreased cytoplasmic Bcr-Abl levels by promoting Bcr-Abl degradation. Silencing MUC1 was also associated with decreases in K562 and KU812 cell self-renewal capacity and with a more differentiated erythroid phenotype. The results further show that silencing MUC1 increases sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis. Analysis of primary CML blasts confirmed that, as found with the CML cell lines, MUC1 blocks differentiation and the apoptotic response to imatinib treatment. These findings indicate that MUC1 stabilizes Bcr-Abl and contributes to the pathogenesis of CML cells by promoting self renewal and inhibiting differentiation and apoptosis.","['Kawano, Takeshi', 'Ito, Masaki', 'Raina, Deepak', 'Wu, Zekui', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Avigan, David', 'Stone, Richard', 'Kufe, Donald']","['Kawano T', 'Ito M', 'Raina D', 'Wu Z', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Avigan D', 'Stone R', 'Kufe D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Glutathione', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma', 'Mucin-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/24/11576 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2756 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Dec 15;67(24):11576-84. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2756.,,PMC3206309,"['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA029431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS332840'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cationic amino acid transporter type 1 (CAT1) paralogues of murine NIH 3T3 and MDTF cells (mCAT1 and dCAT1, respectively) contain two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites in the third extracellular loop (ECL3, the putative Mo-MLV binding site). Glycosylation of dCAT1 inhibits Mo-MLV infection, but that of mCAT1 does not. Compared with mCAT1, dCAT1 possesses an Ile-to-Val substitution at position 214 and a Gly insertion at position 236 in the ECL3. To determine the residues responsible for the loss of dCAT1 receptor function, mutants of mCAT1 were constructed. The mCAT1/insG receptor (with a Gly residue inserted at mCAT1 position 236) had greatly reduced Mo-MLV receptor function compared with mCAT1. Treatment of mCAT1/insG-expressing cells with tunicamycin, an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, increased the transduction titre. In addition, the reduced susceptibility to Mo-MLV observed with mCAT1/insG-expressing cells correlated with impaired binding of Mo-MLV. These results show that a single amino acid insertion confers mCAT1 receptor properties on dCAT1 and provide an important insight into the co-evolution of virus-host interactions.","['Yoshii, Hiroaki', 'Kamiyama, Haruka', 'Amanuma, Hiroshi', 'Oishi, Kazunori', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Kubo, Yoshinao']","['Yoshii H', 'Kamiyama H', 'Amanuma H', 'Oishi K', 'Yamamoto N', 'Kubo Y']","['Department of Preventive and Therapeutic Research for Infectious Diseases, Course of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Molecular Cell Science Laboratory, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan.', 'International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive and Therapeutic Research for Infectious Diseases, Course of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism/*virology', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/deficiency/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.83430-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2008 Jan;89(Pt 1):297-305. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.83430-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the protein product, U19, of the HHV-6B U19 gene is identified as a 47 kDa transcriptional activator. HHV-6B infection or overexpression of U19 transactivated the RANTES promoter. Mutational analysis of the promoter indicated that transactivation was not critically dependent on the promoter sites CRE, NF-kappaB, ISRE or NF-IL6. ND10 are nuclear substructures that are involved in several cellular regulatory pathways, including those controlling gene expression. HHV-6B infection resulted in a reduced number of ND10 structures, but with a concomitantly increased level of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein expression and mRNA induction. The U19 protein co-located to ND10 with PML and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), but whilst PML formed a ring structure, U19 also localized to the centre of ND10. Knockdown of PML by small interfering RNA did not prevent U19 localization to ND10-like foci, but instead led to a fourfold increase in U19-induced transcription from the RANTES promoter. Generation of four truncated U19 proteins indicated that the N-terminal portion of the protein contains a sequence responsible for nuclear localization; a domain in the N-terminal half of U19 is responsible for its ND10 localization, whereas the C-terminal portion contains the transactivation domain. None of the truncated proteins retained full transactivating ability on the RANTES promoter. Thus, U19 is a transcriptional activator that co-localizes with PML and localizes to ND10-like foci independently of PML, yet is regulated negatively by PML or its associated proteins.","['Kofod-Olsen, Emil', 'Ross-Hansen, Katrine', 'Mikkelsen, Jacob Giehm', 'Hollsberg, Per']","['Kofod-Olsen E', 'Ross-Hansen K', 'Mikkelsen JG', 'Hollsberg P']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.83224-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2008 Jan;89(Pt 1):106-116. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.83224-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To stabilize the E-ring, CPT keto analogues with a five-membered E-ring lacking the oxygen of the lactone ring (S38809 and S39625) have been synthesized. S39625 has been selected for advanced preclinical development based on its promising activity in tumor models. Here, we show that both keto analogues are active against purified Top1 and selective against Top1 in yeast and human cancer cells. The keto analogues show improved cytotoxicity toward colon, breast, and prostate cancer cells and leukemia cells compared with CPT. The drug-induced Top1-DNA cleavage complexes induced by the keto analogues show remarkable persistence both with purified Top1 and in cells following 1-h drug treatments. Moreover, we find that S39625 is not a substrate for either the ABCB1 (multidrug resistance-1/P-glycoprotein) or ABCG2 (mitoxantrone resistance/breast cancer resistance protein) drug efflux transporters, which sets S39625 apart from the clinically used CPT analogues topotecan or SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan). Finally, we show that nanomolar concentrations of S38809 or S39625 induce intense and persistent histone gamma-H2AX. The chemical stability of the keto analogues and the ability of S39625 to produce high levels of persistent Top1-DNA cleavage complex and its potent antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines make S39625 a promising new anticancer drug candidate. Histone gamma-H2AX could be used as a biomarker for the upcoming clinical trials of S39625.","['Takagi, Kazutaka', 'Dexheimer, Thomas S', 'Redon, Christophe', 'Sordet, Olivier', 'Agama, Keli', 'Lavielle, Gilbert', 'Pierre, Alain', 'Bates, Susan E', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Takagi K', 'Dexheimer TS', 'Redon C', 'Sordet O', 'Agama K', 'Lavielle G', 'Pierre A', 'Bates SE', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, 37 Convent Drive, Building 37, Room 5068, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Molecular Structure', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/12/3229 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0441 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Dec;6(12 Pt 1):3229-38. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0441.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues BAX and BAK are activated following the induction of apoptosis and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

The activity of both BAX/BAK and BH3-only proteins is opposed by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues such as BCL-2 and MCL-1. Here we show that anti-apoptotic MCL-1 inhibits the function of BAX downstream of its initial activation and translocation to mitochondria. Although MCL-1 interacted with BAK and inhibited its activation, the activity of MCL-1 against BAX was independent of an interaction between the two proteins. However, the anti-apoptotic function of MCL-1 required the presence of BAX.

We used 250 microM H2O2 and 200 ng/mL angiotensin II (ANGII) as damaging factors. RESULTS: A direct cytotoxic effect of Met2PY on Moly cells was observed. In LLC-PK1 cells, co-incubation with 0.03 mM Met2PY protected cells against the DNA damage caused by ANG II. In A549 cells, the action of Met2PY was ambiguous. At lower concentrations (1 and 3 mM), it showed protective effects, although 10 mM Met2PY increased the toxic effect of 250 microM H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Met2PY is not always toxic or harmful. In some circumstances, it may even express beneficial and protective properties.","['Rutkowski, Przemyslaw']",['Rutkowski P'],"['Department of Nephrology, Transplantation, and Internal Diseases, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland. prut@amg.gda.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Ren Nutr,Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,9112938,"['0 (Pyridones)', '0 (l-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay/methods', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Pyridones/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Uremia/blood/*chemically induced']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/03/08 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1051-2276(07)00222-1 [pii]', '10.1053/j.jrn.2007.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ren Nutr. 2008 Jan;18(1):7-11. doi: 10.1053/j.jrn.2007.10.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRI reading was abnormal in the heart (5%), liver (85%), pancreas (40%), and pituitary gland (55%). The heart T2 correlated with peak ferritin levels (P=.024), while the liver T2* correlated with current ferritin (P=.038) values only. Pancreatic T2* values correlated with pituitary T2 and signal intensity ratio values. The ejection fraction was abnormal in 10% of cases and did not correlate with ferritin level or heart T2. The peak liver enzymes correlated with peak ferritin (P=.025), but the current liver enzymes were mostly normal. Pancreatic assessments (fasting glucose, insulin, beta cell function, insulin reserve, and C-peptide) and pituitary growth hormone axis assessments (growth hormone, insulin growth factor-1, and insulin growth factor binding protein-3) were abnormal in 40% to 70% of cases. They were unrelated to pancreas or pituitary MRI values. Interestingly, endocrine assessments correlated with heart T2 values and peak (but not current) ferritin levels. We concluded that iron overload may contribute to organ damage after HSCT, and MRI assessment may be useful in its detection and treatment monitoring.","['Au, W Y', 'Lam, W M', 'Chu, W C', 'Tam, S', 'Wong, W K', 'Pennell, D J', 'Lie, A K', 'Liang, R']","['Au WY', 'Lam WM', 'Chu WC', 'Tam S', 'Wong WK', 'Pennell DJ', 'Lie AK', 'Liang R']","['University Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. auwing@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Heart Diseases/pathology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hemosiderosis/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/*etiology', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous/physiology']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/02/21 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-1345(07)01249-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.09.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2007 Dec;39(10):3369-74. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.09.027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of human adipose-tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSC) as salvage therapy for steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Six patients with steroid-refractory grades III-IV acute GVHD received IV infusions of AMSC. The AMSC dose was 1.0x10(6)/kg. No side effects were noted after the AMSC infusions. Five patients were treated once and one patient twice. Two patients received AMSC from haplo-identical family donors and four from unrelated mismatched donors. Acute GVHD disappeared completely in five of six patients, four of whom are alive after a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 18-90 months) after the initiation of AMSC therapy. All four surviving patients are in good clinical condition and in remission of their hematological malignancy. Two patients died-one with no obvious response to AMSC died of multiorgan failure and one a relapse of leukemia.

Quantification of IgH levels was performed on bone marrow mononuclear cells from 9 patients with B-cell malignancy before and after HSCT by PCR using the consensus JH TaqMan probe in combination with an allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) upstream primer. The IgH levels was normalized by control gene GAPDH. The results indicated that the reproducible sensitivity of RQ-PCR was 1 copy, the significant reduction of IgH copies was observed in bone marrow samples of 9 patients at one month post HSCT (6.67x10(3)/10(6) GAPDH vs 29/10(6) GAPDH, p<0.01). 3 out of 9 patients who achieved complete clinical and molecular cytogenetic remission (CCyR) contained persistently measurable low IgH level of 10(2)/10(6) GAPDH within 15 months and no detectable IgH at 18 months post HSCT. Whereas 5 out of 9 patients whose IgH copies were less than 10(2)/10(6) GAPDH within 3 months and less than 10(3)/10(6) GAPDH 3 months post HSCT achieved a sustained complete remission (CR). IgH copies in one patient were 4.5x10(3)/10(6) GAPDH at 3 months post HSCT, who relapsed at 4 months post HSCT. The median levels of tumor contamination in the stem cell harvests from 8 patients measured by RQ PCR were 3.68x10(2) (0-1720)/10(6) GAPDH. RQ PCR showed that PBPC harvests were less contaminated than BM harvests [75 (0-890)/10(6) GAPDH vs 1.1x10(3) (527-1720)/10(6) GAPDH, p<0.05]. 8 patients whose stem cell harvest were avaiable for RQ PCR were still in CR despite of the tumor contamination. The level of tumor contamination in stem cell harvest well correlated with IgH levels at diagnosis and one month after HSCT (r=0.810, r=0.708, p<0.05). It is concluded that RQ PCR can effectively monitor the IgH levels in patients with B-cell malignancy after auto-HSCT. 10(3)/10(6) GAPDH within 3 months post HSCT may be a cut-off level of IgH copies, which may be used to evaluate different prognoses of patients.","['Yu, Zhen', 'Wang, Ya-Fei', 'Li, Zeng-Jun', 'Zhou, Zheng', 'Xu, Shi-Cai', 'Qiu, Lu-Gui']","['Yu Z', 'Wang YF', 'Li ZJ', 'Zhou Z', 'Xu SC', 'Qiu LG']","['Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2007/12/20 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2007)06-1236-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Dec;15(6):1236-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adult stem cells were cultured in DMEM with HGF (10 ng/ml)+SCF (10 ng/ml)+LIF (10 ng/ml) in induced group I. In induced group II the enriched cells were cultured in DMEM with SCF (10 ng/ml)+LIF (10 ng/ml) and the undifferentiated cells acted as the control group without the factors. The morphology of cells was observed by the inverted phase contrast microscopy; the expression of albumin (Alb), human hepatocyte cytokeratin (CK18) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were detected by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR assay in the 21-day culture. Alb secreted by hepatocytes in the medium was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) at day 7, 14, 21, 23 and 25. The results showed that the shapes of ASCs changed and their sizes and number increased in the course of culture in group I. After being induced for three weeks, the cells turned round and resembled hepatocyte-like cells. The mRNA for Alb could be detected by RT-PCR in the differentiated adult stem cells in group I, and the mRNA for AFP was poorly detected by RT-PCR at day 21. Alb and CK18 were positive through immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry at day 21, compared with group II and the control group. In group I, Alb in the medium significantly increased, compared with control group, and reached the highest level at day 21, then decreased at day 23.

This study was aimed to investigate the T lymphocyte function of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in different status through analyzing intracellular cytokine characteristics of T lymphocytes in AML patients. The T lymphocytes from 18 de nuevo AML patients in different status and 10 healthy controls were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin in the presence of monensin, and were stained with fluorescent McAbs CD4-PITC, CD8-FITC and IFNgamma-PE, ILA-PE, then their T lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry.

It is concluded that the cytokine secretion in T cell subsets of AML patients in different status is changed. Correspondingly, the Th1/Tc1 level is low after stimulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood of de novo AML patients, but not different from healthy controls.

MS-PCR methods were used to detect the status of Id4 gene methylation in healthy individuals and acute leukemia patients. The results showed that Id4 gene was unmethylated in bone marrow samples from healthy individuals. In new diagnosed AML and ALL patients, the rate of Id4 gene methylation was 84% and 86% respectively. Id4 gene methylation was found in all 8 cases of relapsed acute leukemias. In 14 ALL-CR patients with Id4 gene methylation, 8 patients relapsed within 12 months, while in 9 ALL-CR patients with Id4 gene unmethylation only 1 patient relapsed within 12 months. In AML-CR patients, the 12-months relapse rate in patients with Id4 gene methylation was 62.5%, while it was 10% in Id4 gene unmethylation patients, there was significant difference between them. The rate of Id4 gene methylation in ALL-CR patients was 64.3%, while it was 28.6% in AML-CR patients, there was significant difference between them. In the all 39 new diagnosed AL patients, Id4 gene methylation could be detected in 33 patients. In all 8 relapsed AL patients Id4 gene methylation was found, out of 58 AL-CR cases, 24 patients was found with Id4 gene methylation. It is concluded that as compared with healthy individuals, Id4 gene in acute leukemia patients was methylated in different degrees. The percentage of Id4 gene methylation in AL-CR group is lower than that in AL-non remission group.

The effects of NRP-1 interfered with siRNA on proliferation and migration in leukemic cell line HEL were examined by MTT and migration test. The results showed that the expression of NRP-1 mRNA was found in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCS) of 24 AML patients, the positive rate was 100% and significantly higher than that in control group (positive rate 67%). The expressions of NRP-2 mRNA were seen in 79% AML patients and in 67% health control, there was no significant difference between them. The increased NRP-1 expression was directly correlated with the blast percentage in both peripheral blood and bone marrow of AML patients (r=05, r=0.4, p<0.05). The expressions of NRP-1 and NRP-2 mRNA were observed in 6/7 and 3/7 myeloid leukemic cell lines respectively. After HEL cells were transfected with siRNA for 24 hours, the expression levels of NRP-1 mRNA and protein decreased obviously. Under VEGF action, the cell number in control group significantly increased, while the cell proliferation in interfered group had been not changed. After being transfected for 24 hours, the migration in interfered group decreased significantly. It is concluded that the higher level of NRP-1 mRNA is expressed in bone marrow mononuclear cells of leukemia patients and plays a pivotal role in proliferation and migration of myeloid leukemic cells.

In addition, expression of PRAME gene was also analyzed in 7 cases of non-malignant hematological diseases and 8 healthy volunteers. K562 cell line was used as a positive control. The results showed that the expression of PRAME gene was found in 35 cases of acute leukemia, the positive percentage was 64%.

In 35 PRAME positive cases, 28 cases were AML, which mainly belonged to M3, M4 and M2 subtypes, and 5 cases was ALL. In 31 fusion gene positive cases, 23 cases were PRAME positive, and in 24 fusion gene negative cases 12 cases were PRAME positive. No significant relationship was found between PRAME expression level and clinical characteristics (age, sex, WBC count, blast cells in BM).

It is concluded that the PRAME gene expresses in 64% AML patients, which mainly belonged to M3, M4 and M2 subtypes, no expression could be detected in any of the non-malignant hematological diseases and healthy volunteers. There is remarkable difference in the level of PRAME transcript of the 35 cases and the expression of PRAME gene decreases or disappears when the patients achieved complete remission.

The neuroprotective role of gp130 activation has been widely demonstrated in both CNS and PNS, but the mechanism by which this is accomplished is not well established. We investigated temporal and cell-specific activation of signaling pathways induced by LIF in the mature mouse retina. Intravitreal injection of LIF preserved photoreceptor function and prevented photoreceptor cell death from light-induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent manner (2 days post-injection). A therapeutic dose of LIF induced rapid and sustained activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. Activated STAT3 was localized to all the retinal neurons and glial cells, including photoreceptors. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 was robust but transient in Muller glial cells, and undetectable at the time of light exposure. Akt was not activated by LIF. We also show that at the time of neuroprotection, STAT3 but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 or the Akt pathways was active in LIF-treated retinas, and activated STAT3 was clearly localized in transcriptionally active areas of photoreceptor nuclei.

This paper presents a Monte Carlo maximum likelihood method that can be used for estimating a confidence interval that reflects both statistical sampling error and uncertainty in the measurement of exposures. The method is illustrated by application to an analysis of all cancer (excluding leukemia) mortality in a study of nuclear workers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Monte Carlo methods were used to generate 10,000 data sets with a simulated corrected dose estimate for each member of the cohort based on the estimated distribution of errors in doses. A Cox proportional hazards model was applied to each of these simulated data sets.

METHODS: Direct injection of a murine leukemia virus-based vector targeted transgene expression to the proliferating periosteal cells arising shortly after fracture. Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) was selected because the transgene for its prostaglandin products that promote angiogenesis, bone formation and bone resorption, are all required for fracture healing. The human (h) Cox-2 transgene was modified to remove AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region and to improve protein translation. RESULTS: In vitro studies revealed robust and sustained Cox-2 protein expression, prostaglandin E(2) and alkaline phosphatase production in rat bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts transgenic for the hCox-2 gene. In vivo studies in the rat femur fracture revealed that Cox-2 transgene expression produced bony union of the fracture by 21 days post-fracture, a time when cartilage persisted within the fracture tissues of control animals and approximately 1 week earlier than the healing normally observed in this model. None of the ectopic bone formation associated with bone morphogenetic protein gene therapy was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first demonstration that a single local application of a retroviral vector expressing a single osteoinductive transgene consistently accelerated fracture repair.","['Rundle, Charles H', 'Strong, Donna D', 'Chen, Shin-Tai', 'Linkhart, Thomas A', 'Sheng, Matilda H-C', 'Wergedal, Jon E', 'Lau, K-H William', 'Baylink, David J']","['Rundle CH', 'Strong DD', 'Chen ST', 'Linkhart TA', 'Sheng MH', 'Wergedal JE', 'Lau KH', 'Baylink DJ']","['Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bony Callus/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*genetics', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Femoral Fractures/genetics/therapy', 'Fracture Healing/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transgenes']",2007/12/20 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2007/12/20 09:00'],"['2007/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.1148 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2008 Mar;10(3):229-41. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1148.,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The national registry-based case-control study ESCALE (Etude sur les cancers de l'enfant) was carried out in France over the period 2003-2004. Population controls were frequency matched with the cases on age and sex. Maternal household use of pesticides during pregnancy and paternal use during pregnancy or childhood were reported by the mothers in a structured telephone questionnaire. Insecticides (used at home, on pets, or for garden crops), herbicides, and fungicides were distinguished. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) using unconditional regression models closely adjusting for age, sex, degree of urbanization, and type of housing (flat or house). RESULTS: We included a total of 764 cases of acute leukemia (AL), 130 of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 166 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 1,681 controls. Insecticide use during pregnancy was significantly associated with childhood AL [OR = 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-2.5], both lymphoblastic and myeloblastic, NHL (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6), mainly for Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5), and mixed-cell HL (OR = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4-11.8), but not nodular sclerosis HL (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6-1.9). Paternal household use of pesticides was also related to AL (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8) and NHL (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6); but for AL the relationships did not remain after adjustment for maternal pesticide use during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The study findings strengthen the hypothesis that domestic use of pesticides may play a role in the etiology of childhood hematopoietic malignancies. The consistency of the findings with those of previous studies on AL raises the question of the advisability of preventing pesticide use by pregnant women.","['Rudant, Jeremie', 'Menegaux, Florence', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Patte, Catherine', 'Pacquement, Helene', 'Verite, Cecile', 'Robert, Alain', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Margueritte, Genevieve', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Rudant J', 'Menegaux F', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Nelken B', 'Bertrand Y', 'Patte C', 'Pacquement H', 'Verite C', 'Robert A', 'Michel G', 'Margueritte G', 'Gandemer V', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale, Villejuif, France. rudant@vjf.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Family Characteristics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', '*Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.10596 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Dec;115(12):1787-93. doi: 10.1289/ehp.10596.,,PMC2137105,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin lymphoma', 'acute leukemia', 'children', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'pesticide', 'pregnancy']",,,,,,,,

In many ways, T-LGL clones resemble terminal effector CTL, including down-modulation of CD28 and overexpression of perforin, granzymes, and CD57. We studied the transcriptome of T-LGL clones and compared it with healthy CD8+CD57+ effector cells as well as CD8+CD57- populations. T-LGL clones were sorted based on their TCR variable beta-chain restriction, and controls were obtained by pooling cell populations from 14 donors. Here, we focus our analysis on immunological networks, as immune mechanisms play a prominent role in the etiology of bone marrow failure in T-LGL. Informative genes identified by expression arrays were studied further in an independent cohort of patients using Taqman PCR, ELISA assays, and FACS analysis. Despite a strikingly similar gene expression profile between T-LGL clones and their healthy counterparts, important phenotypic differences were identified, including up-modulation of TNFRS9, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, IFN-gamma, and IFN-gamma-related genes, and several integrins/adhesion molecules. In addition, T-LGL clones were characterized by an overexpression of chemokines and chemokine receptors that are typically associated with viral infections (CXCL2, Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1, IL-18, CCR2). Our studies suggest that immunodominant LGL clones, although phenotypically similar to effector CTL, show significantly altered expression of a number of genes, including those associated with an ongoing viral infection or chronic, antigen-driven immune response.","['Wlodarski, Marcin W', 'Nearman, Zachary', 'Jankowska, Anna', 'Babel, Nina', 'Powers, Jennifer', 'Leahy, Patrick', 'Volk, Hans-Dieter', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Wlodarski MW', 'Nearman Z', 'Jankowska A', 'Babel N', 'Powers J', 'Leahy P', 'Volk HD', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. marwlo@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071217,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0107073 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0107073 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Mar;83(3):589-601. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0107073.

This reduction makes it possible for patients who are ineligible for high-dose myeloablative conditioning allo-SCT to benefit from graft-versus-leukemia reaction. In this multicenter, prospective study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we investigated the efficacy of RIC allo-SCT from a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling by using a regimen that uses fludarabine and busulfan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with AML (n = 59) and MDS (n = 34) were included, and the median age was of 53 years. Follow-up for survivors was 43 months (range, 3 to 89 months). The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (150 mg/m(2)) and oral busulfan (8 to 10 mg/kg). All except one patient received mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyslosporine and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. RESULTS: The 100-day, 1-year, and 4-year incidences of NRM were 8, 16%, and 21%, respectively. The 1- and 4-year relapse cumulative incidences were 23% and 37%, respectively, and leukemia recurrence was the main cause of death. The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 43% and 45%, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 168 patients with HL undergoing a first alloSCT (RIC, n = 89; myeloablative conditioning, n = 79) between January 1997 and December 2001 and registered in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database were analyzed. RESULTS: NRM was significantly decreased in the RIC group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.85; 95% CI, 1.62 to 5.02; P < .001). OS was better in the RIC group (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.29; P = .04) and there was a trend for better PFS in the RIC group (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.40; P = .07). RR was higher in the RIC group in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. The development of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) significantly decreased the incidence of relapse, which translated into a trend for a better PFS. CONCLUSION: The lower incidence of NRM in the RIC group is encouraging, particularly because these patients experienced adverse pretransplantation characteristics more frequently. This analysis also indicates the existence of a graft-versus-HL effect correlated to the development of GVHD. Additional efforts to reduce the high RR seen in both groups of patients will be necessary to improve the modest PFS (31% v 27%) and OS (59% v 36%) for patients prepared with RIC or myeloablative conditioning.","['Sureda, Anna', 'Robinson, Stephen', 'Canals, Carmen', 'Carella, Angelo M', 'Boogaerts, Marc A', 'Caballero, Dolores', 'Hunter, Ann E', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Slavin, Shimon', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Schmitz, Norbert']","['Sureda A', 'Robinson S', 'Canals C', 'Carella AM', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Caballero D', 'Hunter AE', 'Kanz L', 'Slavin S', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Gramatzki M', 'Niederwieser D', 'Russell NH', 'Schmitz N']","['Clinical Hematology Division, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Antoni Maria i Claret, 167, 08025 Barcelona, Spain. asureda@santpau.es']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20071217,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.13.2415 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.2415 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 20;26(3):455-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.2415.

However, little is known about the structural basis of these remarkable activities of Nanog. We have previously identified an unusually strong transactivator named CD2 at its C terminus. Here we demonstrate that CD2 is required for Nanog to mediate ES cell self-renewal. Furthermore, deletion and point mutation analysis revealed that CD2 relies on at least seven aromatic amino acid residues to generate its potent transactivating activity. A mutant Nanog bearing alanine substitutions for these seven residues fails to confer LIF-independent self-renewal in mouse ES cells. Substitution of CD2 by the viral transactivator VP16 gave rise to Nanog-VP16, which is 10 times more active than wild-type Nanog in ES cells. Surprisingly, the expression of Nanog-VP16 in mouse ES cells induces differentiation and is thus unable to sustain LIF-independent self-renewal for mouse ES cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the CD2 domain of Nanog is a unique transactivator that utilizes aromatic residues to confer specific activity absolutely required for ES self-renewal.","['Wang, Zhe', 'Ma, Tianhua', 'Chi, Xiaoke', 'Pei, Duanqing']","['Wang Z', 'Ma T', 'Chi X', 'Pei D']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Department of Biological Sciences & Biotechnology, State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology, Institutes of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 [corrected] China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071217,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids, Aromatic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids, Aromatic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Dedifferentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)68208-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M706009200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Feb 22;283(8):4480-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706009200.

Recently, we demonstrated that histone deacetylase inhibitors suppressed this proliferation and induced the differentiation of EoL-1 cells into eosinophils in parallel with a decrease in the level of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha induces the proliferation and whether the suppression of cell proliferation triggers the differentiation into eosinophils. The FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha inhibitor imatinib inhibited the proliferation of EoL-1 cells and decreased the level of the oncoprotein c-Myc as well as the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The proliferation of EoL-1 cells and expression of c-Myc were also inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126 and JNK inhibitor SP600125. The expression of the eosinophilic differentiation marker CCR3 was not induced by imatinib. These findings suggest that FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha induces the proliferation of EoL-1 cells through the induction of c-Myc expression via ERK and JNK signaling pathways, but is not involved in the inhibition of differentiation toward mature eosinophils.","['Ishihara, Kenji', 'Kitamura, Hajime', 'Hiraizumi, Kenji', 'Kaneko, Motoko', 'Takahashi, Aki', 'Zee, Okpyo', 'Seyama, Toshio', 'Hong, Jangja', 'Ohuchi, Kazuo', 'Hirasawa, Noriyasu']","['Ishihara K', 'Kitamura H', 'Hiraizumi K', 'Kaneko M', 'Takahashi A', 'Zee O', 'Seyama T', 'Hong J', 'Ohuchi K', 'Hirasawa N']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiological Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3 Aoba Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071218,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CCR3)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/enzymology/*pathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR3/metabolism', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*metabolism']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02691-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Feb 22;366(4):1007-11. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.063.

Diagnosing hereditary breast cancer syndromes.,3-13,,"Hereditary breast cancer (HBC) accounts for as much as 10% of the total BC burden. Most of these cases will be found to be due to a BRCA germline mutation. An estimated additional 15-20% of those affected with BC will have one or more first- and/or second-degree relatives with BC. Therefore, when these numbers are combined, familial BC risk accounts for approximately 20-25% of the total BC burden. However, because of the often limited information on family history in the etiologic assessment of BC, this may be an underestimate. Confounding factors include its phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity, given the association of HBC with a plethora of differing cancer syndromes. Its most common occurrence is its association with ovarian cancer in the so-called hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome due to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. More rarely, it occurs in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, caused by a p53 germline mutation, in which markedly early-onset BC is found in association with brain tumors, sarcomas, leukemia, lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma. Importantly, the age-adjusted incidence of BC in women in the United States fell sharply, by 6.7%, in 2003, when compared with the rate identified in 2002. We postulate that increasing knowledge about the genetics of BC may have partially contributed to the identification of high-risk patients who thereby may have benefited significantly from early diagnosis.","['Lynch, Henry T', 'Silva, Edibaldo', 'Snyder, Carrie', 'Lynch, Jane F']","['Lynch HT', 'Silva E', 'Snyder C', 'Lynch JF']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska 68178, USA. htlynch@creighton.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20071211,United States,Breast J,The breast journal,9505539,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BLID protein, human)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics', 'BRCA2 Protein/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['TBJ515 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4741.2007.00515.x [doi]']",ppublish,Breast J. 2008 Jan-Feb;14(1):3-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4741.2007.00515.x.

However, the role of Bcl2 in the skeletal system is unknown. Bcl2 has been hypothesized to play an important anti-apoptotic role in osteoblasts during anabolic actions of PTH. Although rational, this has not been validated in vivo; hence, the impact of Bcl2 in bone remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bone phenotype of Bcl2 homozygous mutant (Bcl2(-/-)) mice was analyzed with histomorphometry and muCT. Calvarial osteoblasts were isolated and evaluated for their cellular activity. Osteoclastogenesis was induced from bone marrow cells using RANKL and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), and their differentiation was analyzed. PTH(1-34) (50 microg/kg) or vehicle was administered daily to Bcl2(+/+) and Bcl2(-/-) mice (4 days old) for 9 days to clarify the influence of Bcl2 ablation on PTH anabolic actions. Western blotting and real-time PCR were performed to detect Bcl2 expression in calvarial osteoblasts in response to PTH ex vivo. RESULTS: There were reduced numbers of osteoclasts in Bcl2(-/-) mice, with a resultant increase in bone mass. Bcl2(-/-) bone marrow-derived osteoclasts ex vivo were significantly larger in size and short-lived compared with wildtype, suggesting a pro-apoptotic nature of Bcl2(-/-) osteoclasts. In contrast, osteoblasts were entirely normal in their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. Intermittent administration of PTH increased bone mass similarly in Bcl2(+/+) and Bcl2(-/-) mice. Finally, Western blotting and real-time PCR showed that Bcl2 levels were not induced in response to PTH in calvarial osteoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl2 is critical in osteoclasts but not osteoblasts. Osteoclast suppression is at least in part responsible for increased bone mass of Bcl2(-/-) mice, and Bcl2 is dispensable in PTH anabolic actions during bone growth.","['Yamashita, Junro', 'Datta, Nabanita S', 'Chun, Yong-Hee P', 'Yang, Dong-Ye', 'Carey, Allison A', 'Kreider, Jaclynn M', 'Goldstein, Steven A', 'McCauley, Laurie K']","['Yamashita J', 'Datta NS', 'Chun YH', 'Yang DY', 'Carey AA', 'Kreider JM', 'Goldstein SA', 'McCauley LK']","['Department of Biologic and Materials Sciences, University of Michigan School of Dentistry, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.071211 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2008 May;23(5):621-32. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.071211.,,PMC2674538,"['P30 AR046024/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA093900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AR46024/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA093900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK53904/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053904/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,['J Bone Miner Res. 2011 Jun;26(6):1380'],,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this pilot study was to assess the impact of childhood cancer on employment and sources of income within families. PROCEDURE: A retrospective postal-administered questionnaire was used to collect information from parents of children diagnosed with cancer before 20 years of age between 1990 and 1996 in the province of British Columbia (n = 111). RESULTS: Among full or part-time employed parents, 64% of mothers and 16% of fathers left their job after their child's diagnosis. The large majority of parents who left their jobs were away for less than 1 year (65% of mothers; 78% of fathers) and nearly all were able to return to the same job if they chose to do so (80% of mothers; 89% of fathers). Parents with children <10 years of age at diagnosis and those with leukemia were most likely to take leave from their jobs. There was considerable change in sources of income between the time of diagnosis and survey with more families relying on employment insurance, social assistance or other financial support at diagnosis. Reliance on sources of income other than salary decreased with time since diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the diagnosis of childhood cancer may cause an important but short-term impact on the employment and income sources of affected families.","['Limburg, Heather', 'Shaw, Amanda K', 'McBride, Mary L']","['Limburg H', 'Shaw AK', 'McBride ML']","['Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. heather_limburg@phac-aspc.gc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost of Illness', 'Employment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Income/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*economics', '*Parents', 'Pilot Projects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21448 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):93-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21448.,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):1-2.

Given that in vitro vincristine is metabolized more efficiently by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 than by CYP3A4 and that 70% African-Americans (vs. 20% of Caucasians) express CYP3A5, one may hypothesize that African-Americans metabolize vincristine more efficiently resulting in lower vincristine exposure and associated-toxicity. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis of vincristine-related side effects in pediatric patients treated for preB ALL was performed. Data were compared between Caucasians (n = 92) and African-Americans (n = 21) to examine the relationship between race and vincristine-associated neurotoxicity thus using race as a surrogate for CYP3A5 genotype. Race, age, gender, disease subtype, highest grade of vincristine-associated neurotoxicity (per NIH Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0), number of omitted and reduced vincristine doses, cumulative vincristine dose, and disease outcome were captured. RESULTS: 34.8% of Caucasians experienced symptoms consistent with vincristine-related neurotoxicity compared to 4.8% of African-Americans (P = 0.007). The average grade of neurotoxicity for Caucasians was 2.72 versus grade 1 neurotoxicity in the African-American (P < 0.0001). Four percent of total doses administered to Caucasian patients were reduced due to vincristine-related neurotoxicity compared to 0.1% given to African-Americans (P < 0.0001). 1.2% of all protocol-indicated doses for Caucasians were held due to severe vincristine-associated toxicity compared to 0.1% of doses for African-Americans (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The data support the hypothesis pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 expression contribute to variability in vincristine metabolism and neurotoxicity.","['Renbarger, Jamie L', 'McCammack, Kevin C', 'Rouse, Caroline E', 'Hall, Stephen D']","['Renbarger JL', 'McCammack KC', 'Rouse CE', 'Hall SD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. jarenbar@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['African Americans', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*ethnology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Racial Groups/*ethnology', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects', 'Whites']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21435 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):769-71. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21435.,,,['K23 RR019956/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structurally related Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 exhibits single-agent preclinical activity against lymphoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and displays synergistic cytotoxicity with chemotherapeutics and radiation. METHODS: ABT-263 was tested at concentrations ranging from 1.0 nM to 10.0 microM using 23 cell lines from the PPTP in vitro panel and was tested in 44 xenograft models representing nine distinct histologies using daily gavage administration of ABT-263 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle for 21 days. RESULTS: ABT-263 was active against approximately one-half of the cell lines of the PPTP in vitro panel. The median IC(50) for all of the lines in the panel was 1.91 microM. ABT-263 induced significant prolongation of the EFS distribution in 9 of 35 (26%) of the solid tumor xenografts, and in 5 of 6 (83%) of the evaluable ALL xenografts. ABT-263 induced no objective responses in the solid tumor panels, but induced CRs in 3 of 6 evaluable xenografts in the ALL panel, including two that were maintained for an additional 3 weeks following treatment cessation.

Leukemia is the cancer most often associated with PAP; prolonged neutropenia and reduction of alveolar macrophages by myeloablative chemotherapy or leukemic infiltration are implicated. Only isolated cases of PAP have been reported, and pediatric experience is limited. PROCEDURE: We reviewed all pathology records (1962-2007) of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to identify patients with PAP. RESULTS: Five patients had PAP. As expected, all had leukemia and had profound neutropenia at onset of PAP. A diagnosis was made only after PAS staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung biopsy, or autopsy specimens. Two patients had Down syndrome, which is not known to be associated with PAP. The other three patients had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Two patients showed clinical improvement or histological disappearance of PAP after neutropenia resolved. CONCLUSIONS: PAP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory symptoms in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy, especially those with Down syndrome, a history of HSCT, or active disease. PAP should be confirmed by PAS staining of a BAL or lung biopsy specimen.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Jenkins, Jesse J', 'McCarville, M Beth', 'Morrison, R Ray', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Ribeiro, Raul C']","['Inaba H', 'Jenkins JJ', 'McCarville MB', 'Morrison RR', 'Howard SC', 'Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Neutropenia', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staining and Labeling']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21442 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):66-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21442.,,,['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of initial characteristics on prognosis has been addressed previously in elderly patients; however, very few data are available regarding the prognostic value of immunophenotypic characteristics in this setting. METHODS: The authors investigated expression of the membrane antigens CD13, CD15, CD33, and CD34 by flow cytometry in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML and analyzed whether these parameters had clinical or prognostic relevance to help physicians in their choice of therapy. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping was performed in 273 patients aged > or =60 years (median age, 69 years). CD13 was expressed in 73% of patients, CD15 was expressed in 43% of patients, CD33 was expressed in 64% of patients, and CD34 was expressed in 66% of patients. Complete remission was obtained in 157 patients (58%). The median overall survival was 8.1 months, and the 3-year survival rate was 14%. Three risk groups were defined based on CD34 and CD33 antigen expression: The poor-risk group included patients with CD34-positive/CD33-positive or CD34-negative/CD33-negative disease, the intermediate-risk group included patients with CD34-positive/CD33-negative disease, and the favorable-risk group included patients with CD34-negative/CD33-positive disease. After cytogenetic analyses, immunophenotype was the most significant prognostic factor in terms of survival in a multivariate analysis (P = .03 and P < .0001, respectively). When immunophenotypic and cytogenetic parameters were combined, patients were classified into 4 prognostic groups: Group A (3-year survival rate, 33%) included patients with favorable and normal karyotypes who had a favorable immunophenotype, Group B (3-year survival rte, 28%) included patients with normal karyotypes who had an intermediate immunophenotype, Group C (3-year survival rate, 8%) included patients with intermediate or normal karyotypes who had an unfavorable immunophenotype, and Group D (3-year survival rate, 2%) included all patients who had unfavorable cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotypic characteristics appeared to be a major prognostic factor in this population of elderly patients with AML. By using 2 simple parameters assessed at the time of diagnosis, the authors devised a prognostic system of immediate clinical utility for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapeutic choices.","['Plesa, Claudiu', 'Chelghoum, Youcef', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Elhamri, Mohamed', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Dumontet, Charles', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Plesa C', 'Chelghoum Y', 'Plesa A', 'Elhamri M', 'Tigaud I', 'Michallet M', 'Dumontet C', 'Thomas X']","['Leukemia Unit, Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon Civil Hospices, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'CD13 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23219 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Feb 1;112(3):572-80. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aim was to examine the significance of different response criteria for CML on imatinib therapy. METHODS: In all, 276 patients with chronic phase CML on imatinib therapy were analyzed. Cytogenetic and molecular responses were coded as to single best response and response at specific intervals of treatment. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response (CGCR) with imatinib was 91%; however, the incidence of CGCR at 48 months into therapy was only 78%. Similarly, the incidence of major molecular responses (best cumulative vs landmark at 48 months) were 74% versus 62%, and of undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts 38% versus 24%. There was a strong association between achievement of major cytogenetic response (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positivity <or=35%) at 6 months to 12 months and survival as well as progression-free survival (PFS). Achievement of major molecular response (vs lesser molecular response) in patients in complete cytogenetic response was not associated with significant differences in survival, but showed some association with PFS. Durable CGCR and major molecular responses (documented continuously for >or=12 months) were associated with longer PFS duration but not with survival duration differences. Of interest, major molecular responses documented at least twice were noted in 71% of patients on imatinib therapy; undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts documented at least twice were noted in 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Achievement and durability of CGCR and of major and complete molecular responses at landmark times predict outcome in CML, and may help in comparing the efficacy of different treatments.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Beth Rios, Mary', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Shan J', 'Huang X', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Faderl S', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Verstovsek S', 'Beth Rios M', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23238 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Feb 15;112(4):837-45. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23238.,,,,,,,,['Cancer 2008.

We previously showed the presence of ALT, as detected by ALT-associated promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (APBs) by combined promyelocytic leukaemia immunofluorescence and telomere fluorescence-in situ hybridization, in approximately 25% of frozen specimens obtained from adult patient liposarcomas and proved that ALT negatively affects patient prognosis. In the present study, we assessed the reproducibility of APB detection on frozen versus formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from the same liposarcoma specimens and investigated the eventual stability of ALT in 103 different lesions from 40 adult patients followed during their disease. Irrespective of liposarcoma subtype, we (1) confirmed the presence of ALT in 21.4% of tumours; (2) demonstrated the reliability of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukaemia body detection in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (with qualitative concordance between matched frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples in 29/30 specimens, and high quantitative agreement, as indicated by a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.85); and (3) suggested the stability of ALT status during disease evolution, since the ALT mechanism was never acquired in the 29 patients with initially ALT-negative lesions and lost over time in only two of 11 patients with initially ALT-positive liposarcomas. In conclusion, these results confirm the possibility of investigating the ALT mechanism in archival specimens to obtain biologically relevant information on liposarcoma progression, even when the primary lesion is not available.","['Venturini, L', 'Erdas, R', 'Costa, A', 'Gronchi, A', 'Pilotti, S', 'Zaffaroni, N', 'Daidone, Mg']","['Venturini L', 'Erdas R', 'Costa A', 'Gronchi A', 'Pilotti S', 'Zaffaroni N', 'Daidone M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology and Laboratories, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cryopreservation', 'Disease Progression', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Liposarcoma/*ultrastructure', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Phenotype', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2007/12/19 09:00,2008/04/24 09:00,['2007/12/19 09:00'],"['2007/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.2288 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2008 Mar;214(4):410-4. doi: 10.1002/path.2288.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although some eicosanoids are known to act through receptors, the molecular actions of many PUFA remain obscure. As the three-dimensional structure of eicosanoids allows them to specifically bind and activate their receptors, we hypothesized that the same structure would allow other proteins to associate with PUFA and eicosanoids. Here, we demonstrate that biotinylation of arachidonic acid and its oxygenated derivatives 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and leukotriene (LT) B(4) can be used to pull down associated proteins. Separation of proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that a large number of proteins bound each lipid and that proteins could distinguish between two enantiomers of 5-HETE. Individual proteins, identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, included proteins that are known to bind lipids, including albumin and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, as well as several novel proteins. These include cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin, moesin, stathmin and coactosin-like protein, and G protein signaling proteins, such as Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase B. This method, then, represents a relatively simple and straightforward way to screen for proteins that directly associate with, and are potentially modulated by, PUFA and their derivatives.","['Brock, Thomas G']",['Brock TG'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. brocko@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071215,United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Eicosanoids)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eicosanoids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Rats']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11745-007-3136-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 2008 Feb;43(2):161-9. doi: 10.1007/s11745-007-3136-3.

One direct transcriptional activator of hTERT is the oncogene MYC which is known to be, in turn, activated by JAK2. To explore the relationship of telomerase, MYC and JAK2 in chronic myeloproliferative diseases, we investigated hTERT and MYC expression in bone marrow cells of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). We could determine an up-regulation of MYC expression exclusively in JAK2(wt) ET, whereas hTERT expression was rather inconsistent across the groups. Interestingly, a significant correlation between MYC and hTERT expression could only be established in homozygous JAK2(V617F) PV and control cases.

This new recombinant bispecific CT, called DTEGF13, enhanced the killing potency against the human glioblastoma lines, U87MG (0.015 nM) and U118MG (0.02 nM). A similar enhancement was observed against the lung carcinoma cell line, Calu-3 (0.0018 nM). Enhanced activity could not be explained by an increased number of cytokines available for binding since a combination of monospecific DTEGF and DTIL13 did not cause the same enhanced activity. Enhanced activity was dependent on the presence of both cytokines on the same single chain molecule and killing was receptor specific since target receptor negative leukemia cells were unaffected by the highly selective DTEGF13 and cytotoxicity could be blocked with anti-EGFR and anti-IL-13 antibodies. In a xenograft flank tumor model, intratumoral injection of DTEGF13, but not monospecific DTEGF or DTIL13, significantly inhibited the growth of established U87 tumors in nude mice (P < 0.04). In this model, the human EGF and IL-13 components of DTEGF13 are reactive with mouse EGFR and IL-13R, respectively. These studies show that a new co-targeting agent that simultaneously recognizes EGFR and IL-13R is more effective than its monospecific counterparts and that DTEGF13 has therapeutic advantages for glioblastoma.","['Stish, Brad J', 'Oh, Seunguk', 'Vallera, Daniel A']","['Stish BJ', 'Oh S', 'Vallera DA']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071215,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DTEGF13 cytotoxin)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Diphtheria Toxin/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-007-9499-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2008 Mar;87(1):51-61. doi: 10.1007/s11060-007-9499-8.

Inhibition of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 may delay the transition to androgen-independent growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have established a prostate cancer model with VCaP prostate cancer cells in vivo to study the transition to androgen independence. Here, we investigated the efficacy of AT-101 (R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid; a pan small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Mcl-1) in combination with surgical castration to delay the onset of androgen-independent growth in vivo. RESULTS: AT-101 (15 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) 5 days/week) in combination with surgical castration delayed the onset of androgen-independent prostate cancer growth in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate the induction of caspase-9-and caspase-3-dependent induction of apoptosis following AT-101 treatment in vitro which was accompanied by an AT-101-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AT-101 in combination with surgical castration delays the onset of androgen-independent prostate cancer in vivo by disrupting the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 upregulation during the transition to androgen independence. Further studies are needed to define the mechanism of action by which AT-101 attenuates the expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and to characterize the potential for AT-101 in combination with hormone therapy.","['Loberg, Robert D', 'McGregor, Natalie', 'Ying, Chi', 'Sargent, Erin', 'Pienta, Kenneth J']","['Loberg RD', 'McGregor N', 'Ying C', 'Sargent E', 'Pienta KJ']","['Department of Urology, University of Michigan Urology Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. rloberg@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', '*Orchiectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/02/26 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1593/neo.07778 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2007 Dec;9(12):1030-7. doi: 10.1593/neo.07778.,,PMC2134900,"['P50 CA069568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 A093900/PHS HHS/United States', 'P50 CA69568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BH3 domain', 'Bcl-2', 'hormone refractory', 'orchiectomy']",,,,,,,,

The siIRF-1 cells expressed elevated levels of TLR-4 mRNA and protein compared to controls by 90% and 77%, respectively. ICAM.1 protein expression and apoptosis levels were increased by 8.35- and 4.25-fold, respectively. The siIRF-1 cells overexpressed Bax mRNA compared to controls. Proteomic analysis revealed upmodulation of the Annexin-II protein in siIRF-1 THP-1 cells.

Moreover, the pronounced potentiation of TNFalpha-induced apoptosis by NF-kappaB inhibitors suggest that these compounds could enhance TNFalpha antitumor efficacy through direct induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Therefore, attempts at amplifying signaling pathways that mediate TNFalpha antitumor effects could help to design combination therapies improving its efficiency. We report that nanomolar concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) amplify TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in APL cells expressing a specific repressor of NF-kappaB activation. This effect is abolished by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk and by caspase-8 and -9 inhibitors. Cell death is accompanied by a drop of mitochondrial potential and by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation. Using specific PARP-1 inhibitors and siRNAs, we show that PARP-1 is essential for the synergistic apoptotic effect and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activation triggered by the ATRA/TNFalpha combination. JNK1 siRNAs reduce ATRA/TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and caspase-9 activation. Altogether, these results identify a novel mechanism of PARP-1-induced apoptosis, in which JNK1 provides a link between PARP-1 activation and mitochondrial pathway of caspase-9 activation. This study also suggests that inclusion of nanomolar doses of ATRA could be clinically beneficial in amplifying TNFalpha-induced antitumor signals.","['Mathieu, J', 'Flexor, M', 'Lanotte, M', 'Besancon, F']","['Mathieu J', 'Flexor M', 'Lanotte M', 'Besancon F']","[""INSERM Unite 685, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris Cedex 10, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071217,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', '*Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210997 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210997 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 May 29;27(24):3361-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210997.

Expression of NUP98-IQCG inhibited 32Dcl3 cell apoptosis induced by Ara-C, and partially blocked granulocyte differentiation induced by G-CSF. Colony-forming assay and serial replating assays indicated that NUP98-IQCG was able to stimulate proliferation, partially block differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells but was unable to confer transformation alone.

Most forms of hypertension ultimately result from an increased vascular tone that leads to an elevated total peripheral resistance. Regulation of vascular resistance under normotensive and hypertensive conditions involves multiple mediators, many of which act through G protein-coupled receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells. Receptors that mediate vasoconstriction couple with the G-proteins G(q)-G11 and G12-G13 to stimulate phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) via the Ca2+/MLC kinase- and Rho/Rho kinase-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. Using genetically altered mouse models that allow for the acute abrogation of both signaling pathways by inducible Cre/loxP-mediated mutagenesis in smooth muscle cells, we show that G(q)-G11-mediated signaling in smooth muscle cells is required for maintenance of basal blood pressure and for the development of salt-induced hypertension. In contrast, lack of G12-G13, as well as of their major effector, the leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), did not alter normal blood pressure regulation but did block the development of salt-induced hypertension. This identifies the G12-G13-LARG-mediated signaling pathway as a new target for antihypertensive therapies that would be expected to leave normal blood pressure regulation unaffected.","['Wirth, Angela', 'Benyo, Zoltan', 'Lukasova, Martina', 'Leutgeb, Barbara', 'Wettschureck, Nina', 'Gorbey, Stefan', 'Orsy, Petra', 'Horvath, Bela', 'Maser-Gluth, Christiane', 'Greiner, Erich', 'Lemmer, Bjorn', 'Schutz, Gunther', 'Gutkind, J Silvio', 'Offermanns, Stefan']","['Wirth A', 'Benyo Z', 'Lukasova M', 'Leutgeb B', 'Wettschureck N', 'Gorbey S', 'Orsy P', 'Horvath B', 'Maser-Gluth C', 'Greiner E', 'Lemmer B', 'Schutz G', 'Gutkind JS', 'Offermanns S']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 366, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071216,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Salts)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/*physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*physiology', 'Hypertension/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Salts/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transgenes', 'Vasoconstriction']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1666 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1666 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2008 Jan;14(1):64-8. doi: 10.1038/nm1666.

Little is known, however, about the molecular interactions allowing viral BCL-2 homologs to mediate their anti-apoptotic function. Cellular anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2 and MCL-1, prevent death via selective interactions with pro-death BH3-only proteins. To investigate whether BHRF-1 and KSHV BCL-2 function similarly, we made recombinant BHRF-1 and KSHV BCL-2 proteins. We identified the individual binding patterns for BHRF-1 and KSHV BCL-2 to BH3 domains. These studies surprisingly showed that KSHV BCL-2 is more closely related to MCL-1 than to BCL-2, a result confirmed by sequence analysis. GST-BHRF-1 and GST-KSHV BCL-2 bound BH3-only family proteins from human cells. BHRF-1 protected mammalian cells from growth factor withdrawal, etoposide and adriamycin. We found that both BCL-2 and BHRF-1 sequestered pro-death BH3-only proteins under growth factor-deficient conditions. Finally, we tested the ability of a panel of BH3 peptides to inhibit BHRF-1 and KSHV BCL-2 function in a mitochondrial model of apoptosis. We found that each could be inhibited by the select group of BH3 peptides identified in our binding assay. Our studies define the biochemical interactions underlying BHRF-1 and KSHV BCL-2 anti-apoptotic function, and identify peptides that are prototypic inhibitors of this function.","['Flanagan, A M', 'Letai, A']","['Flanagan AM', 'Letai A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071214,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BHRF1 protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Bcl-2 protein, Human herpesvirus 8)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry', 'Viral Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/05/01 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['4402292 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4402292 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 Mar;15(3):580-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4402292.

This developmentally regulated process is finely tuned through the interaction of circulating systemic hormones and locally produced peptide growth factors, the net result of which is to trigger changes in gene expression by growth plate chondrocytes. These molecular events lead to carefully orchestrated alterations in chondrocyte size, extracellular matrix components, secreted enzymes, growth factors and receptor expression. These events finally result in calcification of the matrix, chondrocyte death, vascular invasion and the completion of endochondral bone formation. Although the past several years have seen important progress in the identification of numerous important factors, which, in a complex and integrated network, control longitudinal bone growth, many of the signaling pathways and their interactions in the growth plate remain poorly understood. The ESPE Growth Plate Working Group (EUROGROP) was established in 2000 with the aim of bringing together both basic and clinical European research groups with an interest in the biology and pathology of the growth plate. The 7th EUROGROP Symposium was held as an official ESPE working group of the 46th ESPE Annual Meeting held in Helsinki, Finland, 2007.

Statin drugs inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, whereas nitrogenous bisphosphonates have more recently been shown to inhibit farnesyl disphosphate synthase. In addition, our laboratory has recently developed several potent and specific bisphosphonate inhibitors of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, including digeranyl bisphosphonate. Because all three enzymes fall in the same biosynthetic pathway and many of the biological effects are due to depletion of downstream products, we hypothesized that simultaneous inhibition of these enzymes would result in synergistic growth inhibition. In this study, we show that inhibition of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase induces apoptosis in K562 leukemia cells. This induction of apoptosis is in part dependent upon both geranylgeranyl diphosphate depletion and accumulation of farnesyl diphosphate. Combinations of either lovastatin or zoledronate with digeranyl bisphosphonate synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis. These combinations also potently inhibited cellular geranylgeranylation. These results support the potential for combinations of multiple inhibitors of isoprene biosynthesis to inhibit cancer cell growth or metastasis at clinically achievable concentrations.","['Dudakovic, Amel', 'Wiemer, Andrew J', 'Lamb, Kimberly M', 'Vonnahme, Laura A', 'Dietz, Sara E', 'Hohl, Raymond J']","['Dudakovic A', 'Wiemer AJ', 'Lamb KM', 'Vonnahme LA', 'Dietz SE', 'Hohl RJ']","['University of Iowa, SE 313 GH, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071214,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Terpenes)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Terpenes/*metabolism']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/03/25 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.107.132217 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.107.132217 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008 Mar;324(3):1028-36. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.132217.

Here we addressed this issue in 45 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients analyzing 2 core apoptogenic events: cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. In patients with good prognosis cytochrome c release was clearly found to be caspasedependent and correlated with activated caspase-3, indicating that activation of initiator or amplifier caspases such as caspase-8 together with an intact apoptosome function are elementary for favorable outcome. The functional integrity of this apoptogenic checkpoint is reflected by the parameter caspase-dependent cytochrome c-related activation of caspase-3 (CRAC(dep)). Patients with positive CRAC(dep) values (intact signaling) exhibited superior survival compared with CRAC(dep) negative patients (deficient signaling). Thus, the propensity to undergo apoptosis of leukemia cells is an important feature for favorable treatment outcome and may serve as an additional stratification tool for pediatric AML patients.

Zinc finger protein Sp1 transactivates DNMT1 gene in mice and is functionally regulated through protein abundance, posttranslational modifications (ie, ubiquitination), or interaction with other transcription factors (ie, NF-kappaB). We hypothesize that inhibition of proteasomal degradation and Sp1/NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation may impair aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity. We show here that, in addition to inducing accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and abolishment of NF-kappaB activities, bortezomib decreases Sp1 protein levels, disrupts the physical interaction of Sp1/NF-kappaB, and prevents binding of the Sp1/NF-kappaB complex to the DNMT1 gene promoter. Abrogation of Sp1/NF-kappaB complex by bortezomib causes transcriptional repression of DNMT1 gene and down-regulation of DNMT1 protein, which in turn induces global DNA hypomethylation in vitro and in vivo and re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes in human cancer cells. The involvement of Sp1/NF-kappaB in DNMT1 regulation is further demonstrated by the observation that Sp1 knockdown using mithramycin A or shRNA decreases DNMT1 protein levels, which instead are increased by Sp1 or NF-kappaB overexpression. Our results unveil the Sp1/NF-kappaB pathway as a modulator of DNA methyltransferase activity in human cancer and identify bortezomib as a novel epigenetic-targeting drug.","['Liu, Shujun', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Lehmann, Esther', 'Huynh, Lenguyen', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Takeki, Mitsui', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Baiocchi, Robert A', 'Blum, William', 'Porcu, Pierluigi', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Byrd, John C', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Liu S', 'Liu Z', 'Xie Z', 'Pang J', 'Yu J', 'Lehmann E', 'Huynh L', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Takeki M', 'Klisovic RB', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Blum W', 'Porcu P', 'Garzon R', 'Byrd JC', 'Perrotti D', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Chan KK', 'Wu LC', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. shujun.liu@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Sp1 kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44636-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-110171 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2364-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-110171.

The meaning of cure in this case, however, was problematic, as it was impossible for physicians to be certain that cancer would not return. This paper uses historical methods to explore how remission was understood by families with children with acute leukaemia during the period in which the first cures were announced, roughly 1972-77. METHODS: These comprised documentary analysis of records of the Medical Research Council's leukaemia working parties, published papers and letters on treatments for childhood leukaemia, and interviews with eight UK paediatric oncologists practising in UK hospitals in the 1960s and 1970s. RESULTS: Two approaches to defining 'cure' in leukaemia can be identified. The first relied on statistical assessment of survival rates. I argue that the concept of 'indefinite remission' came to serve for researchers and clinicians as a proxy measure of cure. However, the concept of 'indefinite remission' left many patients and their families quite uncertain as to whether a cure had really happened. A second approach to defining cure therefore developed. Faced with uncertainty, patients, parents and psychologists sought to develop alternative measures of success--including the notion of 'psychological cure'--that brought forward the moment of cure and its relief. CONCLUSIONS: Changing conceptualizations of leukaemia shaped and were shaped by negotiations over the meaning of 'remission' and 'cure'. On the one hand, the statistical definition of cure was not available for years. On the other hand, psychological cure could begin from the time of first remission, even if medical absolution was not available for years.","['Barnes, Emm']",['Barnes E'],"['Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Simon Building, Brunswick Street, Manchester M13 9PL, UK. emm.barnes@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Chronic Illn,Chronic illness,101253019,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Health Personnel', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', '*Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Medical Audit', '*Patients', '*Remission, Spontaneous', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/03/06 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['3/4/253 [pii]', '10.1177/1742395307085333 [doi]']",ppublish,Chronic Illn. 2007 Dec;3(4):253-64. doi: 10.1177/1742395307085333.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses with imatinib, mainly due to the mutations in the Abl kinase domain, resistance occurs in patients with advanced disease. In the present study on imatinib-resistant K562 cells (IR-K562), however, no such mutations in the Abl kinase domain were observed. Further studies revealed the over-expression of COX-2 and MDR-1 in IR-K562 cells suggesting the possible involvement of COX-2 in the development of resistance to imatinib. So, we sought to examine the effect of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on IR-K562 cells. The results clearly indicate that celecoxib is more effective in IR-K562 cells with a lower IC50 value of 10 microM compared to an IC50 value of 40 microM in K562 cells. This increase in the sensitivity of IR-K562 cells towards celecoxib suggests that the development of resistance in IR-K562 cells is COX-2 dependent. Further studies revealed down-regulation of MDR-1 by celecoxib and a decline in p-Akt levels. Celecoxib-induced apoptosis of IR-K562 cells led to release of cytochrome c, PARP cleavage and decreased Bcl2/Bax ratio. Also, celecoxib at 1 microM concentration induced apoptosis in IR-K562 cells synergistically with imatinib by reducing the IC50 value of imatinib from 10 to 6 microM. In conclusion, the present study indicates over-expression of COX-2 and MDR-1 in IR-K562 cells and celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, induces apoptosis by inhibiting COX-2 and down-regulating MDR-1 expression through Akt/p-Akt signaling pathway.","['Arunasree, Kalle M', 'Roy, Karnati R', 'Anilkumar, Kotha', 'Aparna, A', 'Reddy, Gorla Venkateswara', 'Reddanna, Pallu']","['Arunasree KM', 'Roy KR', 'Anilkumar K', 'Aparna A', 'Reddy GV', 'Reddanna P']","['Department of Animal Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500046, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080220,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (COL11A2 protein, human)', '0 (Collagen Type XI)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type XI/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00439-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jun;32(6):855-64. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.007.

An image dataset of 2287 chromosomes acquired from 24 abnormal and 26 normal Giemsa metaphase cells is utilized to optimize and test the scheme. The overall accuracy is 91.4% for centromere identification and 97.4% for polarity assignment. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can be successfully applied to diverse chromosomes, which include those severely bent and abnormal chromosomes extracted from cancer cells.","['Wang, Xingwei', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Li, Shibo', 'Mulvihill, John J', 'Liu, Hong']","['Wang X', 'Zheng B', 'Li S', 'Mulvihill JJ', 'Liu H']","['Center for Bioengineering and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma, 202 West Boyd Street, Room 219, Norman, OK 73019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Ireland,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Centromere/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'Databases, Factual', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Software']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/04/03 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0169-2607(07)00264-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Methods Programs Biomed. 2008 Jan;89(1):33-42. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.10.013.,,,['CA115320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a critical step to our further series synthesis of derivatives of honokiol, three derivatives of honokiol composed of two isomers and one compound with two formyl groups, which were hardly separated by common purification methods, needed to be rapidly separated and purified. The present work describes analytical and preparative high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) for the isolation and purification of these three C-formylation derivatives of honokiol, named 3'-formylhonokiol, 5-formylhonokiol and 3',5-diformylhonokiol, respectively. The solvent system for HSCCC separation was composed of hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water with the ratio of 1:0.4:1:0.4 (v/v).

Its variable pharmacokinetics, mainly a consequence of variable bioavailability, saturable protein binding and saturable hepatic metabolism, predisposes the drug to therapeutic drug monitoring. Several methods to analyze the drug in serum exist with immunoassays being the method of choice for routine measurements. Immunoassays are specific and sensitive, but cross-reactivity, possibly leading to erroneous serum levels, is a concern. We report a patient with falsely undetectable phenytoin serum levels. CASE REPORT: This 73-year old woman was treated with intravenous phenytoin due to epilepsia partialis continua in the context of a bilateral cerebrovascular insult. Anamnestically, a chronic lymphatic leukemia was known. In this patient, serum phenytoin levels became only detectable by the particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay used after precipitation of serum proteins. Protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal immunoglobulin, identified as IgMlambda. With other methods such as HPLC and fluorescence depolarization immunoassay, phenytoin was detectable. CONCLUSION: We propose interference between the monoclonal IgMlambda and/or other serum proteins and the particle-enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay, rendering phenytoin falsely undetectable in samples of this patient. In such patients, alternative methods such as HPLC should be used to prevent dosage errors.","['Brauchli, Yolanda B', 'Scholer, Andre', 'Schwietert, Martin', 'Krahenbuhl, Stephan']","['Brauchli YB', 'Scholer A', 'Schwietert M', 'Krahenbuhl S']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20071128,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anticonvulsants/*blood/therapeutic use', '*Automation', 'Epilepsy/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'Immunoglobulin M/*blood', 'Paraproteinemias/*blood', 'Phenytoin/*blood/therapeutic use']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(07)00566-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2007.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2008 Mar;389(1-2):174-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2007.11.014.

NLI/Ldb1, a widely expressed nuclear factor, is a potential mediator of long-range interactions. Here, we show that NLI/Ldb1 and erythroid-binding partners GATA-1/SCL/LMO2 bind in vivo to the beta-globin locus control region (LCR). The C-terminal LIM interaction domain of NLI is required for formation of the complex on chromatin. Loss of the LIM domain converts NLI into a dominant-negative inhibitor of globin gene expression, and knockdown of NLI by using shRNA results in failure to activate beta-globin expression. Kinetic studies reveal that the NLI/GATA-1/SCL/LMO2 complex is detected at the beta-globin promoter coincident with RNA Pol II recruitment, beta-globin transcription, and chromatin loop formation during erythroid differentiation, providing evidence that NLI facilitates long-range gene activation.","['Song, Sang-Hyun', 'Hou, Chunhui', 'Dean, Ann']","['Song SH', 'Hou C', 'Dean A']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kinetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', '*Locus Control Region', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1097-2765(07)00637-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2007.09.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2007 Dec 14;28(5):810-22. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2007.09.025.,,PMC2195932,['Z01 DK015508-19/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS36186'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No such effect for all cancers was seen in ecological studies in Germany (1980-1995). Results from exploratory analyses led to a new study. Pre-selected areas around all 16 major nuclear power plants in Germany formed the study area. The design is a matched case-control study; cases are all cancers under five years diagnosed in 1980-2003: 1592 cases, and 4735 controls. Inverse distance of place of residence to the nearest nuclear power plant at the time of diagnosis was used as the independent variable in a conditional logistic regression model. Results show an increased risk for childhood cancer under five years when living near nuclear power plants in Germany. The inner 5-km zone shows an increased risk (odds ratio 1.47; lower one-sided 95% confidence limit 1.16). The effect was largely restricted to leukaemia. The results are compatible with the corresponding subgroups in the previous German ecological studies, with which this study shares most of the cases.

These HMTs are present as distinct multi-protein complexes with several proteins in common. Herein, we have affinity purified and characterized human CpG binding protein (CGBP) and its interacting proteins from human cells. We demonstrated that CGBP is co-purified with three H3K4 specific HMTs MLL1, MLL2, and hSet1. We also performed independent immuno-precipitation of MLL1, MLL2 and hSet1 complexes from human cell and demonstrated that each of these complexes contains CGBP. In addition, CGBP is co-localized with MLL1, MLL2 and hSet1 in vivo and binds to the promoter of MLL target gene HoxA7. Antisense mediated knock down of CGBP diminished the recruitment of MLL1 and down regulated levels of H3K4 trimethylation in HoxA7 promoter affecting its expression. These results demonstrated that CGBP interacts with MLL1, MLL2 as well as hSet1 HMTs and plays critical roles in regulations of MLL target genes.","['Ansari, Khairul I', 'Mishra, Bibhu P', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Ansari KI', 'Mishra BP', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas 76019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071203,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (CXXC1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Trans-Activators']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1874-9399(07)00187-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagrm.2007.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Jan;1779(1):66-73. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2007.11.006.

Immunostaining of PIE cells revealed that TLR4 was precisely expressed in PIE cells at the protein level.

The levels of MMP-2 did not show significant changes between glass and plastic tubes, between serum and plasma, between serum with and without clot accelerators, or between silica and silicate treatments. No modification of MMP-9 expression was obtained by the addition of silica or silicate to previously separated plasma and serum. Increasing the amounts of nonsoluble silica and soluble silicate added to citrate and empty tubes prior to blood collection resulted in increasing levels of MMP-9 relative to citrate plasma and serum.

METHODS: Thirty-three children with newly diagnosed ALL, including 18 cases of low risk, 7 cases of moderate risk and 8 cases of high risk, were enrolled in this study. Twenty-five patients received a complete remission and 8 cases were in non-remission after conventional remission induction chemotherapy. Plasma concentrations of VEGF and TF in the patients were detected using ELISA before and after treatment. Sixteen healthy children served as normal control group. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of VEGF and TF in ALL patients before treatment were significantly higher than those in normal controls (P < 0.01). Plasma concentrations of VEGF and TF in the non-remission group before treatment were significantly higher than those in the remission group (P < 0.05) and the control group (P < 0.01). After treatment the plasma concentrations of VEGF and TF in the non-remission group were not significantly reduced and higher than those in the remission and the control groups (P < 0.01). There were significant differences in plasma concentrations of VEGF and TF among the low-risk, moderate-risk and high-risk groups before and after treatment (P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of VEGF and TF in the high risk group were not significantly reduced after treatment and higher than those in the control group (P < 0.01). A linear correlation was noted between plasma VEGF and TF concentrations in ALL patients before treatment (r=0.50, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF and TF play an important role in the development of ALL and may be useful to the evaluation of the severity and the outcome in ALL.","['Yang, Hua-Qiang', 'Zhang, Rong-Huan', 'Zhang, Zheng-Hua', 'Wan, Chu-Cheng', 'Xia, Yun-Jin']","['Yang HQ', 'Zhang RH', 'Zhang ZH', 'Wan CC', 'Xia YJ']","['Department of Hemotology, Taihe Hospital, Yunyang Medical College, Shiyan, Hubei, China. yanghuaqiang2004@126.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/etiology', 'Thromboplastin/*analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['1008-8830(2007)06-0526-03 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Dec;9(6):526-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical relevance of WT1 gene expression as minimal residual disease (MRD) marker in AML has been questioned. METHODS: We determined the expression of WT1 gene in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells of 100 AML patients at diagnosis and compared it with other MRD markers during follow up in 16 patients using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The median WT1 gene expression was 9.7% of K562 cell line WT1 expression (lower quartile 1.5%, upper quartile 29.9%, n = 100) at diagnosis and, 0.053% (lower quartile 0.022%, upper quartile 0.125%, n = 87) in molecular or immunophenotypic remission. Median WT1 expression in control BM was 0.029% (lower quartile 0.013%, upper quartile 0.061%, n = 22). The upper 99% percentile of remission samples was 0.3%, which was regarded as the cut-off of increased WT1 gene expression in AML and was exceeded in 87% of all AML patients at diagnosis. WT1 and the other MRD markers showed only minor differences in profiles during follow-up. WT1 expression at diagnosis with median value 9.7% as the cut-off level or as a continuous variable had no prognostic significance for 2-yr survival. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of WT1 as a MRD marker was low due to the relatively high background WT1 gene expression in BM cells at remission and in subjects without haematological malignancies. Therefore, WT1 gene expression analysis would be beneficial only in those patients who do not have a more specific and sensitive MRD marker.","['Hamalainen, Mauri M', 'Kairisto, Veli', 'Juvonen, Vesa', 'Johansson, Janita', 'Auren, Jukka', 'Kohonen, Kati', 'Remes, Kari', 'Salmi, Toivo T', 'Helenius, Hans', 'Pelliniemi, Tarja-Terttu']","['Hamalainen MM', 'Kairisto V', 'Juvonen V', 'Johansson J', 'Auren J', 'Kohonen K', 'Remes K', 'Salmi TT', 'Helenius H', 'Pelliniemi TT']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. mauham@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20071210,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/03/04 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1009 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.01009.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Mar;80(3):201-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.01009.x.

In AML MMP-2 levels were lower than in MDS (P < 0.0001) and MMP-9 levels lower than in MDS and controls (P < 0.0001). MMP levels did not predict response to therapy. The release of active MMPs was detected by colorimetric analysis in cell cultures from representative MDS and AML cases. In conclusion, we have demonstrated an abnormal MMP expression in AML as well as in MDS. The production and release of these enzymes may influence haematopoietic cell behaviour. In MDS, the detection of MMP deregulated expression may be important also from the clinical point of view: it may provide a useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis and a possible target for experimental treatments.","['Travaglino, Erica', 'Benatti, Chiara', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Della Porta, Matteo Giovanni', 'Galli, Anna', 'Bonetti, Elisa', 'Rosti, Vittorio', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela']","['Travaglino E', 'Benatti C', 'Malcovati L', 'Della Porta MG', 'Galli A', 'Bonetti E', 'Rosti V', 'Cazzola M', 'Invernizzi R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.

Rasburicase proved to be effective in rapidly reducing UA levels. Costs of rasburicase average up to 4500 euros. To assess if lower doses of rasburicase are effective, we treated patients with lower doses than recommended. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients received rasburicase for prophylaxis (n = 8) or treatment (n = 42) of TLS. The median age was 67 yr (16-88), 21 were female. The majority of patients (n = 46) had hematologic malignancies (acute leukemia, 14; lymphoma, 26; myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndromes, 6) and four had solid tumors. Creatinine levels were increased in 42 patients. RESULTS: Baseline median UA and creatinine levels were 856.5 micromol/L (339-1659.5 micromol/L) and 192.7 micromol/L (65.4-761.1 micromol/L), respectively. Patients received between one and eight doses of rasburicase, the median total dose was 0.049 mg/kg. UA levels were lowered by 83%. After rasburicase treatment, median serum UA and creatinine levels were 160.6 micromol/L (5.9-779.2 micromol/L) and 111.4 micromol/L (46.9-610 micromol/L), respectively. Treatment costs were reduced by 96.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of rasburicase are effective and cost-saving for prophylaxis and treatment of TLS. Application of an initial dose of 3-4.5 mg of rasburicase and subsequently dosage as needed, depending on UA levels, is feasible.","['Hummel, Margit', 'Reiter, Sebastian', 'Adam, Katja', 'Hehlmann, Ruediger', 'Buchheidt, Dieter']","['Hummel M', 'Reiter S', 'Adam K', 'Hehlmann R', 'Buchheidt D']","['III.

While NPM1 mutations are associated with favourable prognosis in younger AML patients, Flt3-ITD mutations reflect an unfavourable prognostic factor in these patients. So far, especially NPM1 mutations have not yet been evaluated exclusively in older patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the prevalence of NPM1 and Flt3-ITD mutations and its association with complete remission (CR), and survival in 99 elderly patients (median age 71 yr, range 60-85 yr) newly diagnosed for AML. Primary treatment approach was curative in 54, and palliative in 38 patients, while seven patients received best supportive care only. The mean follow-up of surviving patients was 600 d. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were tested negative for NPM1 and Flt3-ITD mutations (group 1), 16 patients carried only a NPM1 mutation (group 2) and nine patients had only a Flt3-ITD mutation (group 3) while additional seven patients were positive for both aberrations (group 4). We can demonstrate a significant higher rate of CR comparing wildtype vs. NPM1 positive patients (40.5% for group 1 vs. 80.0% for group 2, P = 0.03) for patients receiving curative therapy. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in overall survival between group 1 and group 2 (Log-rank test P = 0.22, median 440 d vs. 1125 d). In contrast, patients carrying a Flt3-ITD mutation had a significant worse overall survival compared to wildtype patients (P = 0.03, median 210 d for group 3 + 4 vs. 634 d for group 1 + 2) while no difference of CR rate could be observed (42.8% vs. 48.9%, P = 0.91). CONCLUSION: As elderly but medically fit patients with AML carrying a NPM1 mutation have a high CR rate, age itself should not be a barrier for induction treatment. However, new therapeutic concepts of postremission therapy (e.g. allogeneic stem cell transplantation after dose-reduced conditioning) should be considered for these patients in first CR.","['Scholl, Sebastian', 'Theuer, Claudia', 'Scheble, Veit', 'Kunert, Christa', 'Heller, Anita', 'Mugge, Lars-Olof', 'Fricke, Hans-Joerg', 'Hoffken, Klaus', 'Wedding, Ulrich']","['Scholl S', 'Theuer C', 'Scheble V', 'Kunert C', 'Heller A', 'Mugge LO', 'Fricke HJ', 'Hoffken K', 'Wedding U']","['Department of Internal Medicine II (Oncology and Hematology), Universitatsklinikum, Jena, Germany. sebastian.scholl@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/03/04 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1019 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.01019.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Mar;80(3):208-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.01019.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune evasion may be the result of a number of factors, including expansion of regulatory T cells, production of immunosuppressive cytokines, downregulation of HLA class I and tumor-associated antigens and upregulation of immunosuppressive molecules on the surface of tumor cells. CD200, a cell surface ligand that plays a role in regulating the immune system, has been shown to be upregulated on the surface of some hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. This review characterizes the role of CD200 in immune suppression, and describes strategies to target this molecule in the oncology setting, thus directly modulating immune regulation and potentially altering tolerance to tumor antigens.","['Kretz-Rommel, Anke', 'Bowdish, Katherine S']","['Kretz-Rommel A', 'Bowdish KS']","['Aracari Biotech, Del Mar, CA, USA. kretz-rommel@aracaribio.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14712598.8.1.5 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2008 Jan;8(1):5-15. doi: 10.1517/14712598.8.1.5.,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that opioid-containing immune cells migrate to inflamed sites and release beta-endorphins to inhibit pain as a mode of peripheral endogenous opioid analgesia. The present study investigates whether LLLT may enhance peripheral endogenous opioid analgesia. METHODS: The effect of LLLT on opioid analgesia and production was evaluated in vivo in a rat model of inflammation as well as in vitro in Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. mRNA expression of the beta-endorphin precursors proopiomelanocortin and corticotrophin releasing factor was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: LLLT produced an analgesic effect in inflamed peripheral tissue which was transiently antagonized by naloxone. Beta-endorphin precursor mRNA expression increased with LLLT, both in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that LLLT produces analgesic effects in a rat model of peripheral inflammation. We further revealed an additional mechanism of LLLT-mediated analgesia via enhancement of peripheral endogenous opioids. These findings suggest that LLLT induces analgesia in rats by enhancing peripheral endogenous opioid production in addition to previously reported mechanisms.","['Hagiwara, Satoshi', 'Iwasaka, Hideo', 'Okuda, Kentaro', 'Noguchi, Takayuki']","['Hagiwara S', 'Iwasaka H', 'Okuda K', 'Noguchi T']","['Department of Brain and Nerve Science, Anesthesiology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine, 1-1 Idaigaoka-Hasamamachi-Yufu City-Oita 879-5593, Japan. saku@med.oita-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Lasers Surg Med,Lasers in surgery and medicine,8007168,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Narcotic Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)""]",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', ""Freund's Adjuvant/pharmacology"", 'Hindlimb/pathology', 'Hormones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Low-Level Light Therapy', 'Male', 'Naloxone/pharmacology', 'Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Staining and Labeling']",2007/12/18 09:00,2008/03/29 09:00,['2007/12/18 09:00'],"['2007/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/lsm.20583 [doi]'],ppublish,Lasers Surg Med. 2007 Dec;39(10):797-802. doi: 10.1002/lsm.20583.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with acute leukaemias normally must receive anti-leukaemic treatment at full dosage prior to delivery, except for selected women diagnosed very close to term. Treatment should be avoided in the first trimester. The prognosis of pregnant women with acute leukaemia corresponds to that of an age-matched and diagnosis-matched non-pregnant cohort of patients, provided appropriate treatment is given. If given as of the second trimester, the typical chemotherapy regimes used for acute leukaemias imply acceptable acute toxicities to the fetus, with a somewhat increased risk of premature birth or developmental retardation, but no clear evidence of late sequelae in children and adolescents who were exposed to cytostatic agents whilst in utero. In chronic leukaemias and MDS, treatment may often be delayed until after delivery. In CML targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate is safe as of the second trimester, and possibly even before. Obstetric care and monitoring of women with leukaemia are essential throughout the pregnancy to ensure the best possible outcome for mother and child.","['Fey, M F', 'Surbek, D']","['Fey MF', 'Surbek D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital and University, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

The clonogenic activity of JAK2(V617F) mutated cells was inhibited by low concentrations of ITF2357 (IC(50) 0.001-0.01 microM), 100- to 250-fold lower than required to inhibit growth of normal or tumor cells lacking this mutation. Under these conditions, ITF2357 allowed a seven fold increase in the outgrowth of unmutated over mutated colonies. By western blotting we showed that in HEL cells, ITF2357 led to the disappearance of total and phosphorylated JAK2(V617F) as well as pSTAT5 and pSTAT3, but it did not affect the wild-type JAK2 or STAT proteins in the control K562 cell line. By real-time PCR, we showed that, upon exposure to ITF2357, JAK2(V617F) mRNA was not modified in granulocytes from PV patients while the expression of the PRV-1 gene, a known target of JAK2, was rapidly downmodulated. Altogether, the data presented suggest that ITF2357 inhibits proliferation of cells bearing the JAK2(V617F) mutation through a specific downmodulation of the JAK2(V617F) protein and inhibition of its downstream signaling.","['Guerini, V', 'Barbui, V', 'Spinelli, O', 'Salvi, A', 'Dellacasa, C', 'Carobbio, A', 'Introna, M', 'Barbui, T', 'Golay, J', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Guerini V', 'Barbui V', 'Spinelli O', 'Salvi A', 'Dellacasa C', 'Carobbio A', 'Introna M', 'Barbui T', 'Golay J', 'Rambaldi A']","['Hematology Unit, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Z02132R2QQ (givinostat hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/analysis/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/pathology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405049 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405049 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):740-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405049.

Little is known about the metabolism of lipids and function of lipases in CLL cells. Performing gene expression profiling including B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation of CLL cells in comparison to healthy donor CD5+ B cells, we found significant overexpression of lipases and phospholipases in CLL cells. In addition, we observed that the recently defined prognostic factor lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is induced by stimulation of BCR in CLL cells but not in CD5+ normal B cells. CLL cellular lysates exhibited significantly higher lipase activity compared to healthy donor controls. Incubation of primary CLL cells (n=26) with the lipase inhibitor orlistat resulted in induction of apoptosis, with a half-maximal dose (IC(50)) of 2.35 microM. In healthy B cells a significantly higher mean IC(50) of 148.5 microM of orlistat was observed, while no apoptosis was induced in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; P<0.001). Orlistat-mediated cytotoxicity was decreased by BCR stimulation. Finally, the cytotoxic effects of orlistat on primary CLL cells were enhanced by the simultaneous incubation with fludarabine (P=0.003).

However, clinical drug resistance occurs, which warrants development of alternative and/or complementary therapeutic strategies to target critical downstream signaling molecules. We recently demonstrated that disrupting 14-3-3/ligand association by a peptide-based 14-3-3 competitive antagonist R18 induces significant apoptosis, partially through reactivation of AKT-inhibited proapoptotic FOXO3a, in FGFR1 fusion-transformed hematopoietic cells. Here, we report that targeting 14-3-3 by R18 effectively induced significant apoptosis in Ba/F3 and K562 cells expressing BCR-ABL, similarly through liberation and reactivation of FOXO3a. Moreover, R18 sensitized BCR-ABL-transformed cells to inhibition with MEK1 inhibitor U0126, Bcl-2 inhibitor GX15-070, or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Treatment with these reagents potentiated R18-induced reactivation of proapoptotic FOXO3a with enhanced expression of downstream transcription targets p27(kip1) and Bim1.

NKX2-5 is normally expressed in developing spleen and heart, regulating fundamental processes, including differentiation and survival. In this study we investigated whether NKX2-5 expression in T-ALL cell lines reactivates these embryonal pathways contributing to leukemogenesis. Among 18 known targets analyzed, we identified three genes regulated by NKX2-5 in T-ALL cells, including myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C). Knockdown and overexpression assays confirmed MEF2C activation by NKX2-5 at both the RNA and protein levels. Direct interactions between NKX2-5 and GATA3 as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation data may contribute to MEF2C regulation. In T-ALL cell lines LOUCY and RPMI-8402 MEF2C expression was correlated with a 5q14 deletion, encompassing noncoding proximal gene regions. Fusion constructs with green fluorescent protein permitted subcellular detection of MEF2C protein in nuclear speckles interpretable as repression complexes. MEF2C consistently inhibits expression of NR4A1/NUR77, which regulates apoptosis via BCL2 transformation. Taken together, our data identify distinct mechanisms underlying ectopic MEF2C expression in T-ALL, either as a downstream target of NKX2-5, or via chromosomal aberrations deleting proximal gene regions.","['Nagel, S', 'Meyer, C', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Kaufmann, M', 'Drexler, H G', 'MacLeod, R A F']","['Nagel S', 'Meyer C', 'Quentmeier H', 'Kaufmann M', 'Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA']","['Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany. sna@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MADS Domain Proteins)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2C protein, human)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (NKX2-5 protein, human)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MADS Domain Proteins/*physiology', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology', 'Receptors, Steroid/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405067 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405067 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Mar;22(3):600-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405067.

We evaluated the characteristics of 856 patients with low or intermediate-1 disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System. Mean follow-up was 19.6 months (range 1-262). Of these patients, 87 (10%) transformed to acute myelogenous leukemia, and 429 (50%) had died. By multivariate analysis, characteristics associated with worse survival (P<0.01) were low platelets, anemia, older age, higher percent of marrow blasts and poor-risk cytogenetics. Although not included in the model, higher ferritin (P=0.007) and beta2-microglobulin (P<0.001) levels were associated with worse prognosis. This allowed the development of a scoring system in which patients could be grouped in three categories: category 1 (n=182, 21%) with a median survival of 80.3 months (95% CI 68-NA); category 2 (n=408, 48%) with a median survival of 26.6 months (95% CI 22-32) and category 3 (n=265, 31%) with a median survival of 14.2 months (95% CI 13-18).

We present here a protocol for measuring very low rates of cell proliferation, on the basis of the incorporation of deuterium ((2)H) from heavy water ((2)H(2)O) into the deoxyribose moiety of purine deoxyribonucleotides in DNA of dividing cells, by use of gas chromatography/pyrolysis/isotope ratio-mass spectrometry (GC/P/IRMS). Very low levels of label incorporation (>or=0.002% atom percent excess (2)H) can be quantified by GC/P/IRMS. This protocol thereby permits shorter periods or lower amounts of (2)H(2)O administration than would be required using standard GC/MS techniques for measuring cell proliferation kinetics (see accompanying protocol in this issue). A disadvantage of this approach compared to GC/MS is the requirement for larger numbers of cells (> approximately 10(7)). This protocol enables definitive in vivo studies of the fraction or absolute number of newly divided cells and their subsequent survival kinetics in animals and humans, even when turnover rates are very low. Indolent hematologic malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and other relatively quiescent cells represent promising areas of application.","['Voogt, Jason N', 'Awada, Mohamad', 'Murphy, Elizabeth J', 'Hayes, Gregory M', 'Busch, Robert', 'Hellerstein, Marc K']","['Voogt JN', 'Awada M', 'Murphy EJ', 'Hayes GM', 'Busch R', 'Hellerstein MK']","['KineMed Inc., 5980 Horton Street, Emeryville, California 94608, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Nat Protoc,Nature protocols,101284307,"['533-67-5 (Deoxyribose)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J65BV539M3 (Deuterium Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatography, Gas/*methods', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication', 'Deoxyribose/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Deuterium Oxide/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Molecular Conformation']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['nprot.2007.421 [pii]', '10.1038/nprot.2007.421 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Protoc. 2007;2(12):3058-62. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2007.421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML with favorable cytogenetic changes, KIT gene mutation has been known as a worse prognostic marker.

Of these, FLT3-ITD has the most important prognostic implication. Insights into the molecular pathogenesis of AML have led to the development of more specific targeted agents. Currently, a number of agents have been explored in AML, including immunoconjugate of anti-CD33 antibody and cytotoxic agent (gemtuzumab ozogamicin: GO), tyrosine kinase inhibitors and farnesyl transferase inhibitor. These agents have shown promise in small studies. Large phase III studies will reveal whether these are effective in inducing complete remission and prolonging survival. Combining targeted agents with each other or with chemotherapy may improve the response rates. GO is the most promising drug, which has been evaluated in randomized trials by several major cooperative groups to determine whether the addition of GO improves the complete remission rate and overall survival.

Our results show that tandem arrays of miRNA mimics, but not single miRNA mimics, directed against the Abl portion of the mRNA and introduced by lentiviral vectors can effectively alter the leukemogenic potency when the degree of suppression of expression of Bcr-Abl is reduced >200-fold from control levels. Only methods capable of such dramatic sustained reduction in the level of expression of highly activated kinase oncogenes are likely to be effective in controlling malignant cell populations.","['McLaughlin, Jami', 'Cheng, Donghui', 'Singer, Oded', 'Lukacs, Rita U', 'Radu, Caius G', 'Verma, Inder M', 'Witte, Owen N']","['McLaughlin J', 'Cheng D', 'Singer O', 'Lukacs RU', 'Radu CG', 'Verma IM', 'Witte ON']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071213,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/01/29 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['0710532105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0710532105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Dec 18;104(51):20501-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0710532105.

As arginine methylation of histones is an important mechanism in transcriptional regulation, we asked whether PRMT6 possesses activity toward histones. We show here that PRMT6 methylates histone H3 at R2 and histones H4/H2A at R3 in vitro. Overexpression and knockdown analysis identify PRMT6 as the major H3 R2 methyltransferase in vivo. We find that H3 R2 methylation inhibits H3 K4 trimethylation and recruitment of WDR5, a subunit of the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) K4 methyltransferase complex, to histone H3 in vitro. Upon PRMT6 overexpression, transcription of Hox genes and Myc-dependent genes, both well-known targets of H3 K4 trimethylation, decreases. This transcriptional repression coincides with enhanced occurrence of H3 R2 methylation and PRMT6 as well as reduced levels of H3 K4 trimethylation and MLL1/WDR5 recruitment at the HoxA2 gene. Upon retinoic acid-induced transcriptional activation of HoxA2 in a cell model of neuronal differentiation, PRMT6 recruitment and H3 R2 methylation are diminished and H3 K4 trimethylation increases at the gene. Our findings identify PRMT6 as the mammalian methyltransferase for H3 R2 and establish the enzyme as a crucial negative regulator of H3 K4 trimethylation and transcriptional activation.","['Hyllus, Dawin', 'Stein, Claudia', 'Schnabel, Kristin', 'Schiltz, Emile', 'Imhof, Axel', 'Dou, Yali', 'Hsieh, James', 'Bauer, Uta-Maria']","['Hyllus D', 'Stein C', 'Schnabel K', 'Schiltz E', 'Imhof A', 'Dou Y', 'Hsieh J', 'Bauer UM']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT), Philipps-University of Marburg, 35032 Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['21/24/3369 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.447007 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2007 Dec 15;21(24):3369-80. doi: 10.1101/gad.447007.,,PMC2113036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall aim of this project is to estimate the current burden of cancer in Great Britain attributable to occupational factors, and identify carcinogenic agents, industries and occupations for targeting risk prevention. METHODS: Attributable fractions and numbers were estimated for mortality and incidence for bladder, lung, non-melanoma skin, and sinonasal cancers, leukaemia and mesothelioma for agents and occupations classified as International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Group 1 and 2A carcinogens with ""strong"" or ""suggestive"" evidence for carcinogenicity at the specific cancer site in humans. Risk estimates were obtained from published literature and national data sources used for estimating proportions exposed. RESULTS: In 2004, 78,237 men and 71,666 women died from cancer in Great Britain. Of these, 7317 (4.9%) deaths (men: 6259 (8%); women: 1058 (1.5%)) were estimated to be attributable to work-related carcinogens for the six cancers assessed. Incidence estimates were 13,338 (4.0%) registrations (men: 11,284 (6.7%); women 2054 (1.2%)). Asbestos contributed over half the occupational attributable deaths, followed by silica, diesel engine exhaust, radon, work as a painter, mineral oils in metal workers and in the printing industry, environmental tobacco smoke (non-smokers), work as a welder and dioxins. Occupational exposure to solar radiation, mineral oils and coal tars/pitches contributed 2557, 1867 and 550 skin cancer registrations, respectively. Industries/occupations with large numbers of deaths and/or registrations include construction, metal working, personal and household services, mining (not metals), land transport and services allied to transport, roofing, road repair/construction, printing, farming, the Armed Forces, some other service industry sectors and manufacture of transport equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, non-ferrous metals and metal products, and chemicals. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates for all but leukaemia are greater than those currently used in UK health and safety strategy planning and contrast with small numbers (200-240 annually) from occupational accidents. Sources of uncertainty in the estimates arise principally from approximate data and methodological issues. On balance, the estimates are likely to be a conservative estimate of the true risk. Long latency means that past high exposures will continue to give substantial numbers in the near future. Although levels of many exposures have reduced, recent measurements of others, such as wood dust and respirable quartz, show continuing high levels.","['Rushton, L', 'Hutchings, S', 'Brown, T']","['Rushton L', 'Hutchings S', 'Brown T']","[""Imperial College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, St Mary's Campus, London, UK. l.rushton@imperial.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071213,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '1332-21-4 (Asbestos)']",IM,"['Asbestos/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2007/12/15 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['oem.2007.037002 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2007.037002 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2008 Dec;65(12):789-800. doi: 10.1136/oem.2007.037002.

The authors examined the effect of postnatal exposures predicted to affect early immune functioning, including childhood vaccinations, illness, medication use, and breastfeeding patterns. Children 0-15 years of age diagnosed with leukemia from 1990 to 1994 and resident within principal cities across Canada were eligible for inclusion. Through pediatric oncology centers and population-based cancer registries, 399 cases were ascertained at the time of diagnosis. For each participating case, an age-, gender-, and area-matched control was randomly selected from government health insurance rolls. Risk factor information was obtained through personal interviews with each child's parents or guardians. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios, with adjustment for potential confounders. Use of immunosuppressant medication by the index child led to a deficit of risk (odds ratio = 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.16, 0.84), while vitamin intake was positively associated with leukemia (odds ratio = 1.66, 95% confidence interval: 1.18, 2.33). Breastfeeding for more than 6 months was also protective (p < 0.05). Results persisted for cases diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and for children diagnosed at 1-5 years of age.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the spectrum of clinical disease and putative virulence factors in vanB VREfm isolates. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify potential virulence genes (asa1, gel E, cylA, esp and hyl) in VREfm isolates obtained from an Australian population of haematology patients. Clonality was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and automated ribotyping. Infection, requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and all-cause 30-day mortality were used as clinical indicators of organism virulence. Forty-one VREfm vanB isolates (41 patients; 14 infected and 27 colonised only) were analysed. Thirty-five of these isolates were typed by PFGE, 31 of which were represented by three clusters. The esp gene was identified in 22 of 27 (81.5%) screening and 11 of 14 (78.6%) infection-associated isolates. One isolate was hyl gene positive, and no isolate contained asa1, gel E or cylA genes. VREfm infection was independently associated with host factors (underlying diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia, age <or=60 years) but not with presence of the esp gene. ICU admission was negatively associated with presence of the esp gene (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01-0.61; P=0.02). There was no association between 30-day mortality and host factors or the presence of the esp gene. When compared to European and US reports, a high esp gene prevalence and low hyl gene prevalence was observed in polyclonal VRE isolates obtained from this immunocompromised population.","['Worth, L J', 'Slavin, M A', 'Vankerckhoven, V', 'Goossens, H', 'Grabsch, E A', 'Thursky, K A']","['Worth LJ', 'Slavin MA', 'Vankerckhoven V', 'Goossens H', 'Grabsch EA', 'Thursky KA']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia. leon.worth@petermac.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Hosp Infect,The Journal of hospital infection,8007166,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (VanB protein, Enterococcus)', '0 (aggregation substance, Enterococcus faecalis)', '0 (enterococcal surface protein, esp)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (MATK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Clone Cells', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Enterococcus faecium/drug effects/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/microbiology/mortality', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Vancomycin Resistance/*genetics', 'Virulence/genetics']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0195-6701(07)00383-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhin.2007.10.017 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hosp Infect. 2008 Feb;68(2):137-44. doi: 10.1016/j.jhin.2007.10.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several peptides, including LSYLLWRSRLP (LSY), LVAHVGAGGVL (LVA), RVSSCRGRNHIV (RVS), ETIGARWVRIE (ETI), TDGVTYTNDCL (TDG), RVVRYDADFWI (RVV), GFWCRRSGLVGV (GFW), were further characterized. These peptides inhibited the release of histamine from antigen-stimulated mast cells isolated from lung tissues of guinea pigs. Furthermore, the peptides inhibited calcium influx in ovalbumin-stimulated mast cells isolated from lung tissues of guinea pigs. Likewise, the peptides inhibited the release of beta-hexosaminidase from antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells and decreased calcium influx and intracellular reactive oxygen species production as well. We found that the peptides significantly decreased phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and that this was responsible for the decreased calcium influx and beta-hexosaminidase in antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells, suggesting that ERK plays an important role in allergic reactions. The peptides identified in this study also affected upstream signaling of allergic inflammation. In other words, these peptides decreased phosphorylation of Lyn, PKCalpha, and -delta. Lyn and PKC are known to be responsible for the phosphorylation of FcepsilonRI, in response to receptor aggregation. The peptides inhibited interaction between IgE and FcepsilonRI, suggesting that these peptides exert anti-allergic effects by inhibiting receptor cross-linking. These peptides also inhibited interaction between FcepsilonRI and PKCdelta. Taken together, these data suggest that peptides exert anti-allergic effect through the inhibition of upstream signaling, involving receptor cross-linking, and downstream multiple signaling.","['Kim, Kyungjong', 'Kim, Youngmi', 'Kim, Hae Yeong', 'Ro, Jai Youl', 'Jeoung, Dooil']","['Kim K', 'Kim Y', 'Kim HY', 'Ro JY', 'Jeoung D']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chunchon 200-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071128,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/drug effects', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/05/24 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(07)01275-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.11.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Feb 26;581(1-2):191-203. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.11.033.

The mechanisms responsible for NT regulation are largely unknown. IL-4 is a pro-survival signal for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and has been shown to confer resistance to nucleoside analogs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL-4 is able to modulate the expression and function of the human equilibrative NT1 (hENT1) in primary cultures of CLL cells and, consequently, to affect cytotoxicity induced by therapeutic nucleosides analogs. We found that treatment with IL-4 (20 ng/ml for 24 h) increased mRNA hENT1 expression in CLL cells without affecting that of normal B cells. Given that the enhanced mRNA levels of hENT1 in CLL cells did not result in increased transport activity, we examined the possibility that hENT1 induced by IL-4 may require post-translational modifications to become active. We found that the acute stimulation of PKC in IL-4-treated CLL cells by short-term incubation with PMA significantly increased hENT1 transport activity and favoured fludarabine-induced apoptosis. By contrast, and in line with previous reports, IL-4 plus PMA protected CLL cells from a variety of cytotoxic agents.

Thus, in patients with adult-T cell leukaemia (ATL), an HTLV-1 (Human T cell Leukaemia virus type 1)-associated disease, leukemic cells display a high telomerase activity, mainly through transcriptional up-regulation of the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT). The HBZ (HTLV-1 bZIP) protein coded by the minus strand of HTLV-1 genome and expressed in ATL cells has been shown to increase the transcriptional activity of JunD, an AP-1 protein. The presence of several AP-1 binding sites in the hTERT promoter led us to investigate whether HBZ regulates hTERT gene transcription. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate using co-transfection assays that HBZ in association with JunD activates the hTERT promoter. Interestingly, the -378/+1 proximal region, which does not contain any AP-1 site was found to be responsible for this activation. Furthermore, an increase of hTERT transcripts was observed in cells co-expressing HBZ and JunD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that HBZ, and JunD coexist in the same DNA-protein complex at the proximal region of hTERT promoter. Finally, we provide evidence that HBZ/JunD heterodimers interact with Sp1 transcription factors and that activation of hTERT transcription by these heterodimers is mediated through GC-rich binding sites for Sp1 present in the proximal sequences of the hTERT promoter. CONCLUSION: These observations establish for the first time that HBZ by intervening in the re-activation of telomerase, may contribute to the development and maintenance of the leukemic process.","['Kuhlmann, Anne-Sophie', 'Villaudy, Julien', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Castellazzi, Marc', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine']","['Kuhlmann AS', 'Villaudy J', 'Gazzolo L', 'Castellazzi M', 'Mesnard JM', 'Duc Dodon M']","['Virologie Humaine, INSERM-U758, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France. anne-sophie.kuhlmann@ens-lyon.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071213,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/12/15 09:00,2008/03/01 09:00,['2007/12/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-4-92 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-92 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Dec 13;4:92. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-92.,,PMC2235888,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The luciferase reporter plasmids of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene promoter were constructed, and co-transfected into CV-1 cells with AML1-ETO, AML1b and AML1a expression plasmids. The trans-activity of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene promoter was assayed by luminometer. RESULTS: AML1-ETO exhibited a distinct inhibition activity of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene promoter with a sequence-specificity and dosage-dependent manner. The trans-activity of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene promoter decreased to (19 +/- 4)% compared to control group, when 1000 ng pCMV5-AML1-ETO plasmid was used. AML1b and AMLla showed less inhibition activity.

Immunocytochemistry was in some of patients to detect the distribution of beta-catenin at the same time. The clinical significance of beta-catenin was analyzed in combination with patients' clinical information. RESULTS: Expression of beta-catenin was statistically higher in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) samples than in normal donors (P = 0.001 and 0.016 respectively) and chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (P = 0.001 and P = 0.008 respectively), while there was no statistic difference between AML and ALL patients (P = 0.58). In addition, beta-catenin expression in chronic phase CML patients was like that in normal donors (P = 0.49), but increased significantly in blast crisis and accelerated phase. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that BMMNCs from normal donors expressed beta-catenin on the plasma membrane and cytoplasma, while those from acute leukemia expressed beta-catenin to varying degrees in the nucleus as well.

METHODS: Expression levels of pig7 mRNA in bone marrow samples from 138 patients with de novo AL and 21 normal controls and in 6 leukemic cell lines were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Differentiation induction effect by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and concomitant change in pig7 expression were also monitored in NB4 cells. Endonuclease analysis was employed to determined the identity of pig7 transcript present in AL samples. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to elucidate if hypermethylation was responsible for pig7 silence in AL. RESULTS: Compared with that in normal control, pig7 expression was markedly decreased (0.62 vs 18.30, median, P < 0.01) in AL patients on progression (at diagnosis, relapse or refractory). No significant difference was observed between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). AL at diagnosis had a higher pig7 level than those with relapsed or refractory disease (1.43 vs 0.16, median, P < 0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate after chemotherapy was found to be significantly correlated with pig7 expression levels (P < 0.05). Differentiated NB4 cells showed an increased level of pig7 expression (from 1.61 +/- 0.72 to 44.75 +/- 3.93, P < 0.01). Only one form of pig7 transcripts i.e., Small integral membrane protein of late endosome (SIMPLE), was detected in AL patients. Hypermethylation of pig7 promoter was identified in K562 and HL-60 cells, in contrast to non-methylation predominant in U937 cells.

However, how these different specificities have evolved in the primate lineages is not fully understood. Here we used ancestral protein resurrection to estimate the evolution of antiviral restriction specificities of TRIM5alpha on the primate lineage leading to humans. We used TRIM5alpha coding sequences from 24 primates for the reconstruction of ancestral TRIM5alpha sequences using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Ancestral sequences were transduced into HeLa and CRFK cells. Stable cell lines were generated and used to test restriction of a panel of extant retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV-1] and HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus [SIV] variants SIV(mac) and SIV(agm), and murine leukemia virus [MLV] variants N-MLV and B-MLV). The resurrected TRIM5alpha variant from the common ancestor of Old World primates (Old World monkeys and apes, approximately 25 million years before present) was effective against present day HIV-1. In contrast to the HIV-1 restriction pattern, we show that the restriction efficacy against other retroviruses, such as a murine oncoretrovirus (N-MLV), is higher for more recent resurrected hominoid variants. Ancestral TRIM5alpha variants have generally limited efficacy against HIV-2, SIV(agm), and SIV(mac).

Here we evaluated the specificity of 156 validated kinase inhibitors, including inhibitors used in clinical trials, against 60 human Ser/Thr kinases using a thermal stability shift assay. Our analysis revealed many unexpected cross-reactivities for inhibitors thought to be specific for certain targets. We also found that certain combinations of active-site residues in the ATP-binding site correlated with the detected ligand promiscuity and that some kinases are highly sensitive to inhibition using diverse chemotypes, suggesting them as preferred intervention points. Our results uncovered also inhibitor cross-reactivities that may lead to alternate clinical applications. For example, LY333'531, a PKCbeta inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials, efficiently inhibited PIM1 kinase in our screen, a suggested target for treatment of leukemia. We determined the binding mode of this inhibitor by x-ray crystallography and in addition showed that LY333'531 induced cell death and significantly suppressed growth of leukemic cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients.","['Fedorov, Oleg', 'Marsden, Brian', 'Pogacic, Vanda', 'Rellos, Peter', 'Muller, Susanne', 'Bullock, Alex N', 'Schwaller, Juerg', 'Sundstrom, Michael', 'Knapp, Stefan']","['Fedorov O', 'Marsden B', 'Pogacic V', 'Rellos P', 'Muller S', 'Bullock AN', 'Schwaller J', 'Sundstrom M', 'Knapp S']","['Structural Genomics Consortium, Botnar Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LD, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071211,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/classification']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/01/29 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['0708800104 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0708800104 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Dec 18;104(51):20523-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0708800104.

RT-PCR analysis revealed that the HOXC13 and PU.1 genes were expressed in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and their levels decreased during DMSO-induced differentiation into erythroid cells. HOXC13 bound to the ETS domain of PU.1 through a region encompassing the C-terminal part of the homeodomain and the most C-terminal region and enhanced the transcriptional activity of PU.1. Enforced expression of HOXC13 in MEL cells resulted in the suppression of beta-globin gene expression. In MEL cells overexpressing HOXC13 and PU.1, which also inhibits the differentiation of MEL cells, no synergistic effect on the suppression of beta-globin gene expression was observed. However, in the presence of DMSO, the expression levels of the beta-globin gene in the cells overexpressing HOXC13 and PU.1 were, unexpectedly, higher than those in the cells overexpressing PU.1 alone. The levels of PU.1 protein were markedly decreased despite that the levels of mRNA were preserved in the cells overexpressing PU.1 and HOXC13. It was, thus, suggested that although HOXC13 negatively regulates the differentiation of MEL cells into erythroid cells, it antagonizes PU.1 possibly by down-regulation of PU.1 protein in the presence of a differentiation stimulus.","['Yamada, Toshiyuki', 'Shimizu, Takeshi', 'Suzuki, Mitsuhiro', 'Kihara-Negishi, Fumiko', 'Nanashima, Naoki', 'Sakurai, Takuya', 'Fan, Yang', 'Akita, Miki', 'Oikawa, Tsuneyuki', 'Tsuchida, Shigeki']","['Yamada T', 'Shimizu T', 'Suzuki M', 'Kihara-Negishi F', 'Nanashima N', 'Sakurai T', 'Fan Y', 'Akita M', 'Oikawa T', 'Tsuchida S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Genome Biology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071117,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (HOXC13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(07)00531-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 Feb 15;314(4):847-58. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.11.005.

Our previous experiments showed that melittin could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells. This study was to examine the effects of melittin on the growth and angiogenesis of BEL-7402 cell xenografts in nude mice. METHODS: The xenografts derived from BEL-7402 cells were established in BALB/C nude mice. Inoculated mice were randomly divided into normal saline (NS, 10 ml/kg) group, positive control (thalidomide, TLD, 200 mg/kg) group, low dose melittin (40 microg/kg) group, moderate dose melittin (60 microg/kg) group and high dose melittin (80 microg/kg) group. Tumor volume was measured. Tumor tissue was observed under microscope. Microvessel density (MVD) and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) were detected by SABC immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of VEGF and bFGF were analyzed by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The relative tumor volume (V/V0) and MVD were significantly lower in low, moderate and high dose melittin groups than in NS group (4.42+/-0.58, 3.47+/-0.97, and 3.06+/-1.23 vs. 9.06+/-1.45, P<0.01; 11.33+/-1.86, 9.17+/-1.17, and 6.67+/-1.21 vs. 16.50+/-2.35, P<0.01). Tumor tissue necrosis was observed in melittin-treated groups and tumor vessels were destroyed by melittin. The positive expression indexes of VEGF (2.59+/-0.27, 2.61+/-0.17, 1.55+/-0.22 vs. 3.80+/-0.60, P<0.01), bFGF (2.45+/-0.78, 2.27+/-0.36, 2.10+/-0.27 vs. 4.43+/-0.34, P<0.01) and NF-kappaB (2.79+/-0.29, 2.71+/-0.66, 2.26+/-0.56 vs. 4.98+/-0.63, P<0.01) were significantly lower in low, moderate and high dose melittin groups than in NS group. The mRNA levels of VEGF and bFGF were also significantly lower in melittin-treated groups than in NS group. CONCLUSIONS: Melittin could inhibit the growth of BEL-7402 cell xenografts in nude mice. The down-regulation of VEGF, b-FGF and NF-kappaB expression and the inhibition of angiogenesis might play key roles in the antitumor effect of melittin.","['Song, Chang-Cheng', 'Lu, Xiang', 'Cheng, Bin-Bin', 'DU, Juan', 'Li, Bai', 'Ling, Chang-Quan']","['Song CC', 'Lu X', 'Cheng BB', 'DU J', 'Li B', 'Ling CQ']","['Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Militaty Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, PR China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Melitten/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microvessels/*drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Tumor Burden/*drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",2007/12/14 09:00,2009/12/24 06:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X2007121315 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2007 Dec;26(12):1315-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to evaluate the effects of 23 flavonoids on the proliferation of leukemia cell line HL-60, and elucidate the structure-activity relationship (SAR). METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with 23 flavonoids with high purity and definite structure. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) of the 23 flavonoids were calculated. The effects of particular structures on IC50 were evaluated. RESULTS: Most of the 23 flavonoids inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells distinctly, and the effects were enhanced along with increasing concentrations. However, the intensity of their effects were different, which were arranged from strong to weak as follows:3,6-dihydroxyflavone > luteolin > geraldol > 2'-hydroxyflavanone > apigenin > 3,7-dihydroxyflavone > myricetin > fisetin > baicalein > quercetin > flavanone > chrysin > galangin > 4'-hydroxyflavanone > 6-hydroxyflavone > genistein > flavone >7-hydroxyflavone > daidzein > hesperetin > naringenin. The 2,3-double bond in ring C, appropriate hydroxyls, ring B attached at position 2, hydroxyls in position 3, ortho-substituting hydroxyls in ring B were related to enhanced inhibitory effects of flavonoids on the proliferation of HL-60 cells, while the lack of 2,3-double bond, deficiency or redundancy of hydroxyl groups, hydroxyl group in position 5, 7 or meta-substituting hydroxyls in ring B, isoflavone structure were related to reduced inhibitory effects of flavonoids. CONCLUSION: The 2,3-double bond in ring C, appropriate hydroxyls, ring B attached at position 2, hydroxyls in position 3, ortho-substituting hydroxyls in ring B may be key structural requirements of flavonoids for potent cytotoxicity to HL-60 cells.","['Chang, Hui', 'Mi, Man-Tian', 'Gu, Yan-Yan', 'Yuan, Jia-Lin', 'Ling, Wen-Hua', 'Lin, Hui']","['Chang H', 'Mi MT', 'Gu YY', 'Yuan JL', 'Ling WH', 'Lin H']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, College of Preventive Medicine, Third Military University, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Food Safety, Chongqing, 400038, PR China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)', 'O948D0K9BQ (3,7-dihydroxyflavone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apigenin/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Luteolin/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2007/12/14 09:00,2009/12/24 06:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X2007121309 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2007 Dec;26(12):1309-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A nationwide, active surveillance was carried out in Germany for children up to age 17 years who were admitted to a paediatric hospital for varicella or associated complications, including deaths. RESULTS: A total of 10 children with varicella-associated death were reported over period of 2 years, yielding a mortality rate of 0.4/1 000 000 children per year. Three deaths occurred in children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukaemia and disseminated varicella, two shortly after diagnosis of leukaemia and therefore not preventable, and one during remission with an untypical presentation. Two children died with a congenital varicella syndrome. There was no death in children with neonatal varicella. Four other cases were related to varicella pneumonia or septicaemia and one to myocarditis. CONCLUSION: In a population with no general varicella vaccination programme, varicella accounted for a small but not negligible risk for death in immunocompetent and immunocompromised children. Together these data point to the importance of a thoroughly implemented, general varicella vaccination programme.","['Grote, Veit', 'von Kries, Rudiger', 'Springer, Wolfgang', 'Hammersen, Gerhard', 'Kreth, Hans Wolfgang', 'Liese, Johannes']","['Grote V', 'von Kries R', 'Springer W', 'Hammersen G', 'Kreth HW', 'Liese J']","['Institute of Social Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany. veit.grote@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071210,Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chickenpox/complications/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['APA595 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00595.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2008 Feb;97(2):187-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00595.x.

Purine analogs fludarabine (FA) and cladribine (2-CdA) increase cytotoxic effect of Ara-C in leukemic blasts and inhibit DNA repair mechanisms; therefore its association with Ara-C and mitoxantrone (MIT) results in a synergistic effect. In the current report, we present the final results of multi-center phase II study evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of CLAG-M salvage regimen in poor risk refractory/relapsed AML patients. METHODS: The induction chemotherapy consisted of 2-CdA 5 mg/m2, Ara-C 2 g/m2, MIT 10 mg/m2, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. In the case of PR, a second CLAG-M was administered. Patients in CR received consolidation courses based on high doses of Ara-C and MIT with or without 2-CdA. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen patients from 11 centers were registered; 78 primary resistant and 40 relapsed. Sixty-six patients (58%) achieved CR after one or two courses of CLAG-M, 49 (35%) were refractory, and 8 (7%) died early. WBC >10 g/L and age >34 yr were factors associated with increased risk of treatment failure. Hematological toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The probability of OS at 4 yr was 14% (95% CI 4-23%). OS was influenced by age, WBC >10 g/L and poor karyotype in both univariate and multivariate analyses. The probability of 4 yr DFS was 30% for all 66 patients in CR (95% CI 11-49%). Poor karyotype was the only factor associated with decreased probability of DFS.

DNA topoisomerases (topos) are the target of several drugs commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. These drugs induce topo-DNA complexes with either topo I or topo II; then cellular processing converts these complexes into permanent DNA strand breaks that trigger cell death. Using the TARDIS in vivo assay, this study shows for the first time that curcumin induces topo I and topo II (alpha and beta)-DNA complexes in K562 leukemia cells. A comparative analysis revealed that the levels of these complexes were higher than those induced by several standard topo I and topo II inhibitors at equitoxic doses. Curcumin-induced topo I and topo II-DNA complexes were prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine; this suggests that, unlike the standard topo inhibitors, reactive oxygen species may mediate the formation of these complexes. Overall, this work shows that curcumin is capable of inducing topo-DNA complexes in cells with both topo I and topo II and increases the evidence suggesting that this dietary agent has potential to be tested in cancer chemotherapy.","['Lopez-Lazaro, Miguel', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Jobson, Andrew', 'Gilroy, Kathryn L', 'Curtis, Hannah', 'Padget, Kay', 'Austin, Caroline A']","['Lopez-Lazaro M', 'Willmore E', 'Jobson A', 'Gilroy KL', 'Curtis H', 'Padget K', 'Austin CA']","['Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, The Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071213,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Curcumin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Structure', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/np070332i [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2007 Dec;70(12):1884-8. doi: 10.1021/np070332i.

METHODS: In all, 891 patients <18 years were treated in the pediatric trials AML-BFM 93/98 and 290 adolescents and young adults (>16 to <30 years) in the AMLCG 92/99 and AMLSG HD93/98A trials. Treatment schedules and dose intensities were comparable. RESULTS: Initial features and risk factors differed considerably between infants (<2 years) and older age groups and only slightly between children (2 to <13), adolescents (13 to <21) and young adults (21 to <30). Treatment results were most favorable in children (5-year event free survival [EFS]: 54% +/- 3%), slightly inferior in adolescents (46% +/- 4%, P = .03), and unfavorable in young adults (28% +/- 5%, P = .0001). Excluding patients with favorable karyotypes, the results were similar in infants and children (EFS: 44% +/- 4% and 46% +/- 3%, respectively) and inferior in adolescents (35% +/- 4%) and young adults (23% +/- 4%). There was an increased, age-related percentage and inferior outcome in patients with >5% bone marrow blasts after induction. EFS was especially poor in young adults, with blasts >5%. The blast count after induction was of no prognostic value in patients with favorable karyotypes, but a significant risk factor in patients with other cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: Biologic data differed mainly between infants and older age groups. When comparing the same age groups, outcome was similar between the trial groups, which differed from reports concerning acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the prognosis decreased after childhood independent of other risk factors. This indicates that even in the younger cohorts increasing age may be an additional unfavorable factor.","['Creutzig, Ursula', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Sauerland, Maria C', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schlenk, Richard F']","['Creutzig U', 'Buchner T', 'Sauerland MC', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Dohner H', 'Schlenk RF']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, University of Munster, Munster, Germany. ursula@creutzig.de""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging/pathology/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23220 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Feb 1;112(3):562-71. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Automated Childhood Cancer Information System-project found an increasing trend in Europe. Against this background we present the first detailed trend analysis of childhood (aged under 15) malignancies in Germany. We examined incidence rates separately in western Germany 1987-2004 and eastern Germany 1991-2004. We analyzed all malignancies, all main diagnostic groups and relevant subsets using an age-period-cohort model. Additionally we fitted fractional polynomials to assess the linearity of the drift. All malignancies combined (excluding Central Nervous System-tumors and neuroblastoma) show a significant trend: +0.7% in western and +1.1% per year in eastern Germany. The overall trend in Germany is mostly due to the significant increase in lymphoid leukemia, which increased significantly in western Germany (+0.7% per year) and significantly nonlinearly in eastern Germany (+3.3% per year until 1998, +0.8% since 1998), catching up from a level 20% below western Germany. This could be due to life style changes since the reunification in eastern Germany influencing early immune system training. We found no trends for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin's disease shows a cohort effect in western Germany after reunification. Improved registration of CNS tumors led to an increase. Neuroblastoma yielded a period effect in western Germany due to screening.

Leukemia and extracardiac teratomas were next in frequency followed by hepatic tumors, neuroblastoma, placental, soft tissue, and renal tumors. The main presenting findings along with hydrops were hydramnios, a tumor mass, placentomegaly, and stillbirth. Most tumors were detected in the third trimester of pregnancy. No fetus with the diagnosis of cardiac rhabdomyoma, neuroblastoma, brain tumor, rhabdoid tumor, or histiocytosis associated with hydrops survived.

The lower respiratory tract is a sterile environment and host defense is well developed to clear bacteria. This response includes both humeral factors and resident and recruited cells. The alveolar macrophage is an integral component and its long-lifespan aids function. Following low-dose challenge alveolar macrophages clear bacteria from the lung, employing an over-lapping set of microbicidal strategies. At a higher-dose the phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages is overwhelmed but alveolar macrophages help orchestrate the inflammatory response. In the resolution phase of infection alveolar macrophages contribute to apoptosis induction and clearance of recruited cells. This process down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Macrophage function is controlled by induction of apoptosis. Delayed-onset macrophage apoptosis contributes both to bacterial clearance and to resolution of the inflammatory response. Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein with a very short half-life, is a key regulator of macrophage survival and therefore of host responses to common bacterial pathogens in the lung. Studies involving Streptococcus pneumoniae and other respiratory bacteria are discussed to illustrate these points and ephasise that the timing of macrophage apoptosis is important in determining its overall effect on the host pathogen interaction.","['Marriott, Helen M', 'Dockrell, David H']","['Marriott HM', 'Dockrell DH']","['Section of Infection, Inflammation and Immunity, University of Sheffield School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Exp Lung Res,Experimental lung research,8004944,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bacterial Infections/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/physiology', 'Lung Diseases/*immunology/*microbiology/physiopathology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Pneumococcal Infections/immunology/microbiology/physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['788421781 [pii]', '10.1080/01902140701756562 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Lung Res. 2007 Dec;33(10):493-505. doi: 10.1080/01902140701756562.,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a member of the nuclear receptor family that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). In addition to RAR targets, PML-RARalpha silence a wide range of nuclear receptor target genes including PPARgamma targets. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a ligand for the RA receptor (RAR), restores normal retinoid signaling and induces terminal differentiation of APL cells; however, APL cells can develop resistance to ATRA. Using ATRA sensitive NB4 and ATRA-resistant derivative MR2 cell lines, we demonstrate that PPARgamma ligand 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) enhances pro-apoptotic and differentiating effects of ATRA in ATRA-sensitive NB4 cells and partially reverses ATRA resistance in MR2 cells. The CDDO/ATRA combination synergistically induces RARbeta2 expression both in ATRA-sensitive and -resistant APL cells. RARbeta2 MrNA induction by CDDO/ATRA was mediated in part by enhanced H3-Lys9 acetylation in the RARbeta2 promoter which in turn increased the affinity of RARbeta for betaRARE. PPARgamma specific inhibitor T007 and silencing of PPARgamma by siRNA diminished CDDO-induced maturation and RARbeta2 mRNA along with PPARgamma induction indicating that PPARgamma activation is at least partially responsible for the RARbeta2 transcription and maturation induction. In an in vivo mouse model of APL, CDDO derivative CDDO-methyl ester markedly enhanced ATRA-induced maturation and extended the survival of mice. In summary, these results provide rationale for the combined targeting of RAR and PPARgamma nuclear receptors in the therapy of APL.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Contractor, Rooha', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Shi, Yuexi', 'Ling, Xiaoyang', 'Watt, Julie C', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii, Yuko', 'Ohsaka, Akimichi', 'Nagaoka, Isao', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Tabe Y', 'Konopleva M', 'Kondo Y', 'Contractor R', 'Tsao T', 'Konoplev S', 'Shi Y', 'Ling X', 'Watt JC', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii Y', 'Ohsaka A', 'Nagaoka I', 'Issa JP', 'Kogan SC', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070904,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nicotinic Acids)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)', 'UVU4X1103P (LG 100268)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nicotinic Acids/pharmacology', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'PPAR gamma/*drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Response Elements/drug effects', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/agonists/*pharmacology']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['4982 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.6.12.4982 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Dec;6(12):1967-77. doi: 10.4161/cbt.6.12.4982.

The cells show appreciable apoptosis suppression but retain their ability to differentiate and maturate. Ph chromosome, bcr/abl oncogene and Ph+, bcr/abl+ cells themselves are the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia. Under leukemia progression differentiating Ph+, bcr/abl+ cells transform into leukemic malignant cells with differentiation block. It is assumed to be a result of subsequent mutations or activation of proliferation of long silent Ph+ cells arisen previously in the stem cells because of the translocation. Real mechanism underlying the cell transformation remains unknown. This work was performed to develop a proper cell model allowing us to study functioning of differentiating Ph+, bcr/abl+ cells and their real transformation into malignant cells with block of differentiation. For this purpose we have investigated kinetics of Ph+, bcr/abl+ cells proliferation, differentiation, cell death and transcription of antiapoptotic genes in cultured 14-day of Ph+ mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of a patient in chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia before treatment. The results obtained revealed that Ph+ cell differentiation proceeded in accord with characteristic scheme of chronic myeloid leukemia in vivo. Myeloid cells of hematopoietic cell lineage amounted to 3/4 of live Ph+ mononuclear cells undergoing accumulation and subsequent consumption in the course of differentiation. 95% myeloid cells were differentiating Ph+ granulocytes. The most deal of differentiating Ph+ cells was myelocytes. The rate ratio of myelocyte accumulation to its subsequent consumption showed that the rate of transformation into metamyelocytes was significantly decreased at this differentiation stage. Ph+ cells cultivation curves characterized cell death at different differentiation stages. There were observed the cell death of proliferating Ph+ cells and Ph+ myelocytes, and intensive death of mature cells as well. P/D index, that is ratio of immature Ph+ granulocytes differentiated by cell dividing (blasts, promyelocytes and myelocytes) to the cells differentiated without dividing (metamyelocytes and mature neutrofiles), revealed active of proliferation at the beginning of cultivation and unexpected new proliferative activity at the end of cultivation in the presence of growth factor. The peaks of antiapoptotic bcr/abl gene transcription activity coincided with the observed active proliferation at the beginning and at the end of cultivation. Cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were noticeably accelerated by growth factor treatment. Thus, the study of the Ph+ cells cultivation kinetics is rather informative approach to investigation of continuous regulation of cellular and molecular processes in vitro in the case of chronic myeloid leukemia and allows more complete consideration of Ph+, bcr/abl+ cells hematopoiesis.","['Akhlynina, T V', 'Gerasimova, L P', 'Sarkisian, G P', 'Borovkova, T V', 'Dukhovenskaia, E A', 'Manakova, T E', 'Naidenova, N M', 'Timofeev, A M', 'Grineva, N I']","['Akhlynina TV', 'Gerasimova LP', 'Sarkisian GP', 'Borovkova TV', 'Dukhovenskaia EA', 'Manakova TE', 'Naidenova NM', 'Timofeev AM', 'Grineva NI']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2007;49(10):889-900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that mannan-methotrexate conjugate should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for intraperitoneally disseminated tumors.","['Budzynska, Renata', 'Nevozhay, Dmitry', 'Kanska, Urszula', 'Jagiello, Monika', 'Opolski, Adam', 'Wietrzyk, Joanna', 'Boratynski, Janusz']","['Budzynska R', 'Nevozhay D', 'Kanska U', 'Jagiello M', 'Opolski A', 'Wietrzyk J', 'Boratynski J']","['Laboratory of Biomedical Chemistry, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, 53-114 Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Mannans)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mannans/*pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",2007/12/14 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/12/14 09:00'],"['2007/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/000000007783980837 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2007;16(9):415-21. doi: 10.3727/000000007783980837.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examination of population-based incidence data provides insight regarding etiology among various demographic groups and may result in new hypotheses. The objective of the current study was to present updated information regarding childhood cancer incidence and trends in the U.S. overall and among demographic subgroups, including Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics, for whom to the authors' knowledge trends have not been previously examined. METHODS: Data obtained by 13 registries of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were evaluated to assess incidence and trends of common primary cancers diagnosed between 1992 and 2004 among children aged birth to 19 years. Frequencies, age-adjusted incidence rates, and joinpoint regression results, including annual percent change (APC) in incidence rates (and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]), were calculated. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2004, a modest, nonsignificant increase in the average annual incidence rate (APC, 0.4%; 95% CI, -0.1%-0.8%) was observed for all pediatric cancer diagnoses combined. There was a suggestion of an increase in leukemia (APC, 0.7%; 95% CI, -0.1%-1.5%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in particular (APC, 0.8%; 95% CI, -0.4%-1.9%), whereas rates for central nervous system tumors overall were stable (APC, -0.1%; 95% CI, -1.1%-1.0%); 2 joinpoints were observed for astrocytoma. Rate increases were noted for hepatoblastoma (APC, 4.3%; 95% CI, 0.2%-8.7%) and melanoma (APC, 2.8%; 95% CI, 0.5%-5.1%). Differences by demographic group (sex, age, and race/ethnicity) are also described. CONCLUSIONS: The observed trends reinforce an ongoing need for population-based surveillance and further etiologic studies.","['Linabery, Amy M', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Linabery AM', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23169 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Jan 15;112(2):416-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23169.,,,['T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that the metabolites of alcohol are likely carcinogens and that leukemia, the most frequent childhood cancer, can arise in utero, the study of alcohol consumption as a potential risk factor for the development of childhood cancer is justified. This article summarizes the epidemiological evidence on the association between parental exposure to alcohol and the risk of childhood cancers. To do this, a thorough search of the literature from 1960 to 2003 using the PubMed database was carried out. It yielded 33 case-control studies published between 1982 and 2003, including 13 studies that considered paternal exposure in the preconceptional period. In 10 of the 33 studies at least 1 statistically significant risk increase was reported in relation with parental alcohol consumption; in 7 of these studies the increase was related to maternal consumption, whereas in 3 studies, it was related to paternal consumption. The cancers most often found associated with parental drinking were leukemia, brain tumors, and neuroblastoma. A few studies also reported a protective effect with maternal exposure at modest levels. Inconsistencies in the results and the low risks reported do not suggest an association between childhood cancer and parental consumption of alcohol. However, before reaching any definitive conclusions, methodological issues need to be addressed in future studies, as well as the role of genetic susceptibility. Moreover, subtypes of specific cancers need to be studied separately.","['Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'El-Zein, Mariam']","['Infante-Rivard C', 'El-Zein M']","['Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. claire.infante-rivard@mcgill.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev,"Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Parental occupational exposure to pesticides is also a concern because exposures occurring during pregnancy and carry-home residues also contribute to children's cumulative burden. A number of epidemiological studies consistently reported increased risks between pesticide exposures and childhood leukemia, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma. An extensive review of these studies was published in 1998 (Zahm & Ward, 1998). Fifteen case-control studies, 4 cohort studies, and 2 ecological studies have been published since this review, and 15 of these 21 studies reported statistically significant increased risks between either childhood pesticide exposure or parental occupational exposure and childhood cancer. Therefore, one can confidently state that there is at least some association between pesticide exposure and childhood cancer. However, an unambiguous mechanistic cause-and-effect relationship between pesticide exposure and childhood cancer was not demonstrated in these studies, and modifying factors such as genetic predisposition, rarely considered in the reviewed studies, likely play an important role. While the time window of exposure may be a crucial determinant for biological effects associated with pesticide exposure on children, studies have not contributed definitive information on the most vulnerable period. Accurate exposure assessment remains a challenge; future epidemiological studies need to assess gene-environment interactions and use improved exposure measures, including separate parental interviews, specific pesticide exposure questions, and semiquantitative exposure measures that can be used to confirm information obtained through questionnaires.","['Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Weichenthal, Scott']","['Infante-Rivard C', 'Weichenthal S']","['Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. claire.infante-rivard@mcgill.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev,"Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

The question to be addressed in the present work is the potential use of these extracellular vesicles as a biological drug delivery tool, using Hoechst 33342 as a model of a DNA-targeting drug. After cell growth with or without the dye, vesicles were prepared from the cell-free growth medium by differential centrifugation, giving rise to two types of vesicles. Negative staining electron microscopy showed their large heterogeneity in size. Using fluorescence techniques, data were obtained on the dye loading and its environment inside the vesicles. By UV video-microscopy, it was demonstrated that the dye-containing vesicles were able to deliver it into the nuclei of naive Dictyostelium cells, thus overcoming their constitutive resistance to the free dye. A vesicle-mediated dye-transfer into the nuclei of living human leukaemia multidrug resistant K562r cells was also observed.","['Tatischeff, Irene', 'Lavialle, Francoise', 'Pigaglio-Deshayes, Sophie', 'Pechoux-Longin, Christine', 'Chinsky, Laurent', 'Alfsen, Annette']","['Tatischeff I', 'Lavialle F', 'Pigaglio-Deshayes S', 'Pechoux-Longin C', 'Chinsky L', 'Alfsen A']","['Laboratoire de Biophysique Moleculaire, Cellulaire et Tissulaire (BioMoCeTi), Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, CNRS UMR 7033, Genopole Campus 1, 5 rue Henri Desbrueres, Evry Cedex, France. tati@ccr.jussieu.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071212,Netherlands,J Fluoresc,Journal of fluorescence,9201341,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Liposomes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Vesicles/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Dictyostelium/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Liposomes', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Molecular Structure', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10895-007-0271-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Fluoresc. 2008 Mar;18(2):319-28. doi: 10.1007/s10895-007-0271-4.

A major obstacle in leukemia therapy is the emergence of GC-resistant cells. Hence, combinatory treatment protocols should be developed that convert GC-resistant leukemia cells into sensitive ones. Here we demonstrate that the broad-acting kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS) confers GC-sensitivity on GC-resistant T lymphoma cells expressing elevated levels of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, but not on GC-resistant myelogenic leukemia cells expressing Mcl-1 in addition to Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL. In T lymphoma cells, STS induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic orphan receptor Nur77 that overcomes the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2, thus enabling GCinduced apoptosis. However, in the myelogenic leukemia cells, STS does not upregulate Nur77. In these cells, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is rapidly downregulated by GC and the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein is upregulated by STS, thereby leading to an even more resistant phenotype. Altogether, our data provide a molecular basis for the differential apoptotic response of T lymphoma versus myelogenic leukemia cells to STS and GC. The former being sensitized to GC-induced apoptosis by STS, whereas in the latter, STS intensifies GC resistance. The cell type specific responses should be taken into consideration when combinatory therapy is used for treating hematopoietic malignancies.","['Kfir, Shlomit', 'Sionov, Ronit Vogt', 'Zafrir, Elazar', 'Zilberman, Yael', 'Yefenof, Eitan']","['Kfir S', 'Sionov RV', 'Zafrir E', 'Zilberman Y', 'Yefenof E']","['The Lautenberg Center of Immunology, Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20070907,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Phosphotransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*physiology', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/physiology']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['5023 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.24.5023 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Dec 15;6(24):3086-96. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.24.5023.

It was recently reported that Rana pipiens oocytes contain still another ribonuclease, named Amphinase (Amph). Amph shows 38-40% amino acid sequence identity with onconase, presents as four variants varying between themselves from 87-99% in amino acid sequence identity and has a molecular mass approximately 13,000. In the present study we describe the effects of Amph on growth of several tumor cell lines. All four variants demonstrated cytostatic and cytotoxic activity against human promyelocytic HL-60-, Jurkat T-cell- and U-937 monocytic leukemia cells. The pattern of Amph activity to certain extent resembled that of Onc. Thus, cell proliferation was suppressed at 0.5-10.0 mug/ml (40-80 nM) Amph concentration with distinct accumulation of cells in G(1) phase of the cell cycle. In addition, the cells were undergoing apoptosis, which manifested by DNA fragmentation (presence of ""sub-G1"" cells, TUNEL-positivity), caspases and serine proteases activation as well as activation of transglutaminase. The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of Amph required its ribonuclease activity: the enzymatically inactive Amph-2 having histidine at the active site alkylated was ineffective. The effectiveness and cell cycle specificity was generally similar for all four Amph variants and at the equimolar concentrations was somewhat more pronounced than that of Onc. The observed cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of Amph against tumor cell lines suggests that similar to Onc this cytotoxic ribonuclease may have antitumor activity and find an application in clinical oncology.","['Ardelt, Barbara', 'Ardelt, Wojciech', 'Pozarowski, Piotr', 'Kunicki, Jan', 'Shogen, Kuslima', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Ardelt B', 'Ardelt W', 'Pozarowski P', 'Kunicki J', 'Shogen K', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute and Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20070912,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (amphinase, Rana pipiens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytostatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Oocytes/*enzymology', 'Rana pipiens', 'Ribonucleases/*pharmacology']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['5045 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.6.24.5045 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Dec 15;6(24):3097-102. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.24.5045.

These alterations are present at the earliest stage of malignant transformation, suggesting that additional events are required for overt malignancy. In this study, we pursued the investigation of the 12p13 deletion, previously shown to occur in approximately half of T-PLLs. We refined the minimal region of deletion by single nucleotide and microsatellite polymorphism allelotyping. We defined a 216-kb region containing the CDKN1B gene that encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein p27(KIP1). Sequencing this gene in 47 T-PLL patient samples revealed a nonsense mutation in one case without 12p13 deletion. The absence of biallelic inactivation of CDKN1B for most patients suggested a haploinsufficiency mechanism for tumor suppression, which was investigated in an animal model of the disease. In a Cdkn1b(+/-) background, MTCP1 transgenics had consistent and multiple emergences of preleukemic clones not observed in control cohorts. The second Cdkn1b allele was maintained and expressed in these preleukemic clones. Altogether, these data strongly implicate CDKN1B haploinsufficiency in the pathogenesis of T-PLL.","['Le Toriellec, Emilie', 'Despouy, Gilles', 'Pierron, Gaelle', 'Gaye, Nogaye', 'Joiner, Marjorie', 'Bellanger, Dorine', 'Vincent-Salomon, Anne', 'Stern, Marc-Henri']","['Le Toriellec E', 'Despouy G', 'Pierron G', 'Gaye N', 'Joiner M', 'Bellanger D', 'Vincent-Salomon A', 'Stern MH']","['Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Paris.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44631-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-095570 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2321-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-095570.

Here, we demonstrate that both AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that their turnover critically depends on the E2-conjugase UbcH8 and the E3-ligase SIAH-1. Contrary to its role in HDAC2 degradation, the E3-ligase RLIM does not target AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha for ubiquitin-dependent elimination. RLIM rather is a substrate of SIAH-1, which indicates that these E3-ligases operate in a hierarchical order. Remarkably, proteasomal degradation of leukemia fusion proteins, in addition to the block of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity is a consequence of HDAC-inhibitor treatment. The former requires the induction of UbcH8 expression and each of these processes might be beneficial for leukemia treatment. Our observations shed light on the mechanism determining the interplay between E2-conjugases, E3-ligases, and their substrates and suggest a strategy for utilizing the ubiquitylation machinery in a therapeutic setting.","['Kramer, Oliver H', 'Muller, Sylvia', 'Buchwald, Marc', 'Reichardt, Sigrid', 'Heinzel, Thorsten']","['Kramer OH', 'Muller S', 'Buchwald M', 'Reichardt S', 'Heinzel T']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Jena, Philosophenweg 12, D-07743 Jena, Germany. o.kraemer@uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071211,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2L6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (seven in absentia proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/physiology', '*Ubiquitination', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/05/29 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['fj.06-8050com [pii]', '10.1096/fj.06-8050com [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2008 May;22(5):1369-79. doi: 10.1096/fj.06-8050com.

Although there are about 600 000 L1 copies covering 23% of the rat genome, full-length rat L1s (L1Rn) with intact open reading frames (ORFs) representing functional master copies for retrotransposition have not been identified yet. In conjunction with studies to elucidate the role of L1 retrotransposons in tumorigenesis, we isolated and characterized 10 different cDNAs from transcribed full-length L1Rn elements in rat chloroleukemia (RCL) cells, each encoding intact ORF1 proteins (ORF1p). We identified the first functional L1Rn retrotransposon from this pool of cDNAs, determined its activity in HeLa cells and in the RCL cell line the cDNAs originated from and demonstrate that it is mobilized in the tumor cell line in which it is expressed. Furthermore, we generated monoclonal antibodies directed against L1Rn ORF1 and ORF2-encoded recombinant proteins, analyzed the expression of L1-encoded proteins and found ORF1p predominantly in the nucleus. Our results support the hypothesis that the reported explosive amplification of genomic L1Rn sequences after their transcriptional activation in RCL cells is based on L1 retrotransposition.

However, whereas ALDH1A1 is consistently regulated by TLX1, endogenous FHL1 is only induced in a proportion of fibroblast or T-cell clones stably expressing TLX1. Here, we provide an explanation for these findings by demonstrating that the induction of FHL1, but not ALDH1A1, requires a high level of TLX1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells. In luciferase reporter assays, TLX1-mediated repression rather than activation of the FHL1 gene promoter and the magnitude of this effect was strongly influenced by the cellular background. Together, these results characterize TLX1 as a dual function regulator whose activity in respect to FHL1 is critically dependent upon its cellular concentration, as well as cell type and promoter context.","['Rice, Kim L', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Greene, Wayne K']","['Rice KL', 'Kees UR', 'Greene WK']","['School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Division of Health Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071210,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (FHL1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region"", 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mice', 'Muscle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transfection']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02623-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Mar 14;367(3):707-13. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.005.

Contribution of the V617F JAK2 mutation to the pathophysiology, diagnosis and outcome].",535-48,,"An increased platelet number in blood depends on a limited spectrum of causes, which aren't always simple to identify. Secondary thrombocytosis is a reactive process in relation with acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, or asplenia. The infrequent inherited thrombocytoses disorders are suspected when similar cases are observed in the same family. However, the most frequent causes of chronic thrombocytosis in adults are the so-called chronic myeloproliferative syndromes (chronic myelocytic leukaemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocytemia), and to a lesser extent, myelodysplastic syndromes. In the course of these disorders, thrombocytosis is often the first recognized abnormality. Chronic myelocytic leukaemia is easily diagnosed owing to the presence of either the Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR-ABL fusion gene product. The next step still relies upon a distinction according to the PVSG or the WHO criteria of Polycythemia Vera (PV) and Idiopathic myelo fibrosis (IMF) to finally confirm genuine Essential Thrombocythemia (ET). The recent description of the V617F mutation of JAK2 in 90% of PV patients, 43 to 67% with IMF and 50% of ET diagnosed according to either the PVSG or the WHO criteria is a definite characteristic of clonality now accessible in haematology practice. However, this mutation is neither specific nor constant in any of the Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative disorders, which outlines the importance of the WHO criteria of megakaryocytic abnormalities on bone marrow biopsy as the hallmark of Ph negative MPDs. The exclusion of PV and of IMF, including pre fibrotic and early fibrotic forms is still required for the diagnosis of ""true"" ET. Disease stratification and treatment strategy are targeted on the evaluation and prevention of vascular complications. Acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia, and other clonal progressions like myelofibrotic transformation, are infrequent and delayed events. However, according to the present data, the risk of fibrotic progression or of leukaemic transformation is not related to the mutation status of ET patients.","['Briere, Jean']",['Briere J'],"[""Hematologie, Hopital d'Argenteuil, 97105 cedex.""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology/physiopathology', 'Thrombocytosis/*etiology', 'World Health Organization']",2007/12/13 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 2007 Mar;191(3):535-48.,56,,,,,"Thrombocytemie essentielle.

In group Ib out of 17 patients, 9 patients (53%) achieved CR after remission induction. Eleven patients died during treatment while one patient relapsed in this group. Overall CR, RR & mortality was 29.4% (5/17), 6% (1/17) & 55% (11/17) respectively. In group II all patients achieved CR (100%) after 1st course of chemotherapy. Two of these patients unfortunately died of uncontrolled sepsis during 1st consolidation, while remaining 4 patients 66.6% are on maintenance chemotherapy and are still in CR. CONCLUSION: Overall CR, RR and mortality in all groups was 35% (16/46), 13% (6/46) and 52% (24/46) respectively at a median follow-up of 36 + 8 months. Survival in AML-M3 patients treated with ATRA based chemotherapy is significantly superior than anthracycline based chemotherapy (66.6% vs. 29.4%).

METHOD: Bone marrow (BM) clonal cells (which had cytogenetic markers detected by FISH assay) and blasts were quantitatively analysed in 51 MDS and 11 AML patients. The clonal cell percentage in orthochromatic normoblasts, granulocytes and megakaryocytes were assayed. The biological functions for phagocytosis and oxidation of MDS peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils were compared with that of normal controls. RESULTS: Almost all MDS patients BM had a higher clonal cell percentage (mean 48.2%) than blasts percentage (mean 6.7%) (P < 0.01), but with the subtype of MDS advancing this percentage gap was closing up, and in 11 AML patients no such gap was observed. This gap in MDS patients with + 8 abnormality was smaller than in those with 5q -. In MDS BM, clonal cells were detected in segmented granulocytes (mean 45.9%), orthochromatic normoblasts (mean 46.0%) and mature megakaryocytes (mean 38.0%). In Addition, an approximate amount of clonal cells with the same karyotype abnormality in BM were detected in MDS PB (mean 37.3% in blood vs 48.6% in marrow). Functional analysis showed that the neutrophils in MDS PB could exert nearly normal physiological functions (P > 0.05), but those from AML could not as compared to healthy donors (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference in the biological features between MDS and AML clonal cells.","['Li, Xiao', 'Wu, Ling-Yun', 'Ying, Shao-Xu', 'Chang, Chun-Kang', 'He, Qi', 'Song, Lu-Qian', 'Pu, Quan']","['Li X', 'Wu LY', 'Ying SX', 'Chang CK', 'He Q', 'Song LQ', 'Pu Q']","['Department of Hematology, Sixth Peoples Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai 200233, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",2007/12/13 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Jul;28(7):478-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: RT-PCR was used to detect the PTEN mRNA expression in leukemia cell lines K562 (as negative control) and Jurkat (as positive control) and 65 MDS and MDS/AML patients. Flow cytometry was used to detect p-Akt in HL-60 and Jurkat cells and 30 MDS patients. RESULTS: (1) K562 cells present PTEN gene expression while Jurkat cells did not. Of 65 MDS and MDS/AML patients, 27 (41.5%) expressed PTEN mRNA, being significantly lower than that in normal group (85.7%) (P < 0.01). (2) Jurkat cell showed high expression (86.9%) of p-Akt, while HL-60 cell as negative control did not express. P-Akt levels of 30 MDS patients were increased (1.35% - 58.23%), being much higher as compared with that of the normal contrast group (0.54% - 2.34%) (P < 0.01). Moreover, with the rate of blast cells increasing, the p-Akt level was rising up. There is a positive correlation (r = 0.93, P < 0.01) between the low expression rate of PTEN and the positive rate of p-Akt. CONCLUSION: The loss of PTEN gene expression is one of the important factors of p-Akt high expression in MDS patients, moreover, it may speed up the progress of the MDS or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.","['Chen, Bao-Guo', 'Zhu, Min', 'Luo, Wen-Da', 'Yan, Wei-Hua', 'Zhou, Mei-Ying', 'Li, Bo-Li', 'Tao, Dan-Dan']","['Chen BG', 'Zhu M', 'Luo WD', 'Yan WH', 'Zhou MY', 'Li BL', 'Tao DD']","['Central Laboratory, Department of Hematology of Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, Linhai 317000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2007/12/13 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2007/12/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2007/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Jul;28(7):470-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The first case of Sweet's syndrome (SS) developed in a APL patient treated with ATRA was reported in mainland of China, and reviewed correlative literature. RESULTS: Only 14 cases of SS associated with ATRA therapy in APL have been reported in the literature, including the present case. The median age was 49.5 years (9 -84) and 10 were women and 4 men. Of them, SS was restricted to the skin in 10 case, the other 4 muscle, fascia, kidney, and lung were involved. SS appeared after a median of 18 days of ATRA therapy (6 - 34 days). The median WBC count was 7.05 (0.80 - 23.00) x 10(9)/L. Four patients continued with the ATRA therapy without interruption, 13 patients treated with steroids and 12 responded. One patient improved without any treatment. Two cases of SS developed retinoic acid syndromes after ATRA therapy.

RESULTS: Sixty-nine kinds of structural rearrangements were detected by M-FISH besides typical t (9;22) translocation, among them only 10 were balanced ones and 59 unbalanced ones including 1 insertion, 6 deletions, 52 translocations and derivative chromosomes. In addition, 23 numerical abnormalities were detected. All chromosomes were involved in CML-BC, and chromosomes 17, 2, 8, 16 involvements were the most frequent. M-FISH failed to find out the abnormal clone in 1 case, discovered CCA clones that were missed CC in 6 cases.

Large series of patients with DNETs and pharmaco-resistant epilepsy have been reported. DNETs are most often located in the temporal lobe, occurring in both mesial and lateral temporal locations. DNETs have also been reported in the insular cortex, brain stem, cerebellum, occipital lobe and striatum. Approximately 40% of DNETs are cystic, and solitary nodular, multinodular or diffuse forms have been recognized. Approximately 30% of DNETs are associated with subtle cortical dysplastic changes in the adjacent cortex. DNET nodules usually look like oligodendroglioma, whilst between the nodules it may be possible to recognize vertical columns of neurons surrounded by oligodendrocyte-like cells. Cytologically, oligodendroglial-like cells of DNETs are distinguished from oligodendroglioma by larger nuclei with frequent nuclear indentations and multiple, small nucleoli, whilst oligodendrogliomas consistently show nuclear roundness with one or two occasional nucleoli. Very rare cases of malignant transformation have been reported. DNETs are hypodense on CT and demonstrate decreased signal on the T1-weighted images and a hyper-intense signal on T2-weighted MRI. DNETs associated with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy should be removed early to achieve seizure freedom and prevent tumour progression. The surgical approach should be that of an extended lesionectomy, i.e. excision of the lesion and the abnormal dysplastic cortex around it. Use of MRI-based image guidance (neuronavigation) as a surgical tool to identify this area of abnormal cortex is very helpful to ensure that the extended lesionectomy includes any visibly dysplastic cortex. It is not advocated to use a stereotactic biopsy only, as this may generate an unrepresentative tissue sample consisting of an oligodendroglial component only and may lead to an incorrect diagnosis.","[""O'Brien, D F"", 'Farrell, M', 'Delanty, N', 'Traunecker, H', 'Perrin, R', 'Smyth, M D', 'Park, T S']","[""O'Brien DF"", 'Farrell M', 'Delanty N', 'Traunecker H', 'Perrin R', 'Smyth MD', 'Park TS']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Epilepsy Surgery Programme, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. dfobstl@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Br J Neurosurg,British journal of neurosurgery,8800054,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnostic Imaging/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Epilepsy/diagnosis/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['788287663 [pii]', '10.1080/02688690701594817 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Neurosurg. 2007 Dec;21(6):539-49. doi: 10.1080/02688690701594817.,64,,,,,,,,"[""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Overproduction of IL-6 has been shown to play a role in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and, therefore, an agent blocking IL-6 actions can be a therapy of these diseases. IL-6 belongs to a cytokine family, which shares the cytokine receptor subunit glycoprotein (gp) 130. This family also includes IL-11, oncostatin-M, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) system, both a membrane-bound IL-6R and a soluble form of IL-6R are able to mediate IL-6 signals into the cells through the interaction of gp130. Tocilizumab is a humanized antihuman IL-6 receptor antibody designed using genetic engineering technology. Tocilizumab recognizes both the membrane-bound and the soluble form IL-6R and specifically blocks IL-6 actions. Tocilizumab is expected to ameliorate the autoimmune inflammatory diseases with IL-6 overproduction and has been clinically developed as a therapeutic agent for RA, systemic-onset and articular types of JIA, Crohn's disease, etc. Tocilizumab has been shown to be effective not only for improving signs and symptoms but also for preventing joint destruction of RA.

We previously demonstrated that 24 malignant human cell lines expressed erythropoietin and its receptor and that erythropoietin secretion was enhanced under anoxia. In this study, we examined the viability of 22 of these cell lines excluding two leukemia cell lines under anoxia. METHODS: Twenty-two cancer cell lines of various origins were cultured under anoxia or normoxia for 4 days, and their viability was examined at 1-day intervals. The levels of lactate and ATP were measured. The expressions of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and Bcl-2 family proteins were examined by western blotting analysis. The cellular and mitochondrial features were examined by microscopy. RESULTS: Eleven of the 22 cancer cell lines examined showed 80% to 100% cell viability after 4 days under anoxia; 2 cell lines showed similar viability for 3 days, 3 cell lines showed similar viability for 2 days, and 6 cell lines showed similar viability for 1 day or less. These 11 death-resistant cell lines, which secrete various amounts of erythropoietin under anoxia, produced significantly more lactate during 2 days under anoxia than under normoxia, with ATP levels about 60% of those before anoxia. ATP returned to the normal level when normoxia was restored after 4 days of anoxia. However, the nonresistant cell lines responded to anoxia by yielding significantly more lactate without a reduction of the ATP level. The expression patterns of Bcl-2 family proteins revealed that apoptosis-inhibiting signals predominated over proapoptotic signals in the death-resistant cells under anoxia. CONCLUSION: The majority of the cancer cell lines examined survived under anoxia in vitro, through the Pasteur effect, in a dormant state without direct support of erythropoietin.","['Yasuda, Megumi', 'Matsubara, Junko', 'Yamasaki, Harufumi', 'Fujita, Yoshihiko', 'Konishi, Hiroyoshi', 'Koinuma, Satoshi', 'Taketani, Shigeru', 'Horiuchi, Yoshitaka', 'Utsumi, Hiroshi', 'Yasuda, Yoshiko']","['Yasuda M', 'Matsubara J', 'Yamasaki H', 'Fujita Y', 'Konishi H', 'Koinuma S', 'Taketani S', 'Horiuchi Y', 'Utsumi H', 'Yasuda Y']","['Department of Anatomy, Division 1, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osakasayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071221,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/05/23 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10147-007-0714-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec;12(6):455-62. doi: 10.1007/s10147-007-0714-6.

In addition, curcumin has also been shown to have in vitro and in vivo efficacy against a variety of malignancies. In the current study we examined the cytotoxic effect of curcumin on seven osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines with varying degrees of in vivo metastatic potential. Curcumin inhibited the growth of all OS cell lines tested with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 14.4 to 24.6 microM. Growth inhibition was associated with a dose dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells and accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Curcumin treatment also resulted in cleavage of caspase-3 and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase. Moreover, curcumin treatment was associated with an increase in cellular levels of the apoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein and a decrease in cellular content of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In addition, curcumin treatment also inhibited the migration of OS cell lines. These data indicate that the potent cytotoxic activity of curcumin on OS cell lines is mediated by induction of apoptotic processes. Thus, curcumin has potential to be a novel OS chemotherapeutic agent.","['Walters, Denise K', 'Muff, Roman', 'Langsam, Bettina', 'Born, Walter', 'Fuchs, Bruno']","['Walters DK', 'Muff R', 'Langsam B', 'Born W', 'Fuchs B']","['Laboratory for Orthopaedic Research, Department of Orthopaedics, Balgrist University Hospital, University of Zurich, Forchstrasse 340, 8008 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071211,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcuma/chemistry', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'India', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10637-007-9099-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2008 Aug;26(4):289-97. doi: 10.1007/s10637-007-9099-7.

IC(50) measurements demonstrated that the vinorelbine-resistant cell line N.63 was sensitive to both vinblastine and vinflunine. In addition, vinorelbine-resistant cell line N2.5 retained sensitivity to vinflunine. We used flow cytometry with propidium iodide to measure G2/M arrest in response to drug treatment. Annexin V labeling was used as a marker of apoptosis and JC-1 dye labeling as a marker of mitochondrial membrane depolarization to explore differential responses that might help explain the absence of cross resistance to vinflunine. At equipotent (10X IC(50)) doses, after 8 h of drug treatment, vinflunine induced G2/M arrest in a significantly larger fraction of vinorelbine- resistant cells compared to vinorelbine. At the same drug doses, at 16 h after initiation of drug treatment, vinflunine induced a statistically significant greater apoptotic response and mitochondrial depolarization. The mitochondrial depolarization at 16 h was confirmed by Western blotting that showed release of cytochrome c. Comparison of apoptotic and mitochondrial depolarization responses in vinorelbine-resistant cells upon exposure to vinorelbine, vinblastine and vinflunine demonstrated the following pattern of drug activity: vinflunine > vinblastine > vinorelbine, confirming the importance of a antimitotic-induced mitochondria-mediated pathways in these P388 cell lines. We conclude that vinflunine may be preferred for treatment of specific cancers compared to other vinca alkaloids due to its enhanced effects on apoptotic pathways that follow G2/M arrest.","['Aggarwal, Ashish', 'Kruczynski, Anna', 'Frankfurter, Anthony', 'Correia, John J', 'Lobert, Sharon']","['Aggarwal A', 'Kruczynski A', 'Frankfurter A', 'Correia JJ', 'Lobert S']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20071211,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vinorelbine']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10637-007-9102-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2008 Aug;26(4):319-30. doi: 10.1007/s10637-007-9102-3.

Random chromosomal insertion of SB vectors represents a safety issue in human gene therapeutic applications, due to potential genotoxic effects associated with transposon integration. We investigated the transcriptional activities of SB in order to assess its potential to alter host gene expression upon integration. The untranslated regions (UTRs) of the transposon direct convergent, inward-directed transcription. Transcription from the 5'-UTR of SB is upregulated by the host-encoded factor high-mobility group 2-like 1 (HMG2L1), and requires a 65-base pair (bp) region not present in commonly used SB vectors. The SB transposase antagonizes the effect of HMG2L1, suggesting that natural transposase expression is under a negative feedback regulation. SB transposon vectors lacking the 65-bp region associated with HMG2L1-dependent upregulation exhibit benign transcriptional activities, at a level up to 100-times lower than that of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) long terminal repeat (LTR). Incorporation of chicken beta-globin HS4 insulator sequences in SB-based vectors reduces the transactivation of model promoters by transposon-borne enhancers, and thus may lower the risk of transcriptional activation of host genes situated close to a transposon insertion site.","['Walisko, Oliver', 'Schorn, Andrea', 'Rolfs, Frank', 'Devaraj, Anantharam', 'Miskey, Csaba', 'Izsvak, Zsuzsanna', 'Ivics, Zoltan']","['Walisko O', 'Schorn A', 'Rolfs F', 'Devaraj A', 'Miskey C', 'Izsvak Z', 'Ivics Z']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071211,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (HMGB2 Protein)', '0 (HMGXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'HMGB2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Models, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transposases/genetics/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31403-4 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300366 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Feb;16(2):359-69. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300366.

GM slowly released both cell lines from doxorubicin-induced G2 arrest into G1 phase. GM also abrogated ICRF-193-induced decatenation G2 checkpoint in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. Western blot analysis showed that addition of GM attenuates doxorubicin- and ICRF-193-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345. GM, however, failed to abrogate G2 arrest in p53-positive ML-1 cells maybe due to the p21 induction. GM released HeLa cells from doxorubicin-induced G2 arrest but trapped them at M phase. Flow cytometric analysis showed that addition of GM converted doxorubicin-induced necrosis into apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Colony assay indicated that although GM has a weak cytotoxic effect as a single agent, it dramatically intensifies the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and ICRF-193 in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. These results suggest that abrogation of G2 checkpoint by GM may play a central role in sensitizing p53-negative tumor cells to DNA-damaging and decatenation-inhibiting agents.","['Sugimoto, K', 'Sasaki, M', 'Isobe, Y', 'Tsutsui, M', 'Suto, H', 'Ando, J', 'Tamayose, K', 'Ando, M', 'Oshimi, K']","['Sugimoto K', 'Sasaki M', 'Isobe Y', 'Tsutsui M', 'Suto H', 'Ando J', 'Tamayose K', 'Ando M', 'Oshimi K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. ksugimot@med.juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071210,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/physiology', 'Diketopiperazines', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210978 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210978 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 May 15;27(22):3091-101. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210978.

In this study, we show that PKC412 exerts differential cell cycle effects on AML cells depending on the presence of FLT3 mutations. PKC412 elicits massive apoptosis without markedly affecting cell cycle patterns in AML cell lines with FLT3 mutations (MV4-11 and MOLM13), whereas it induces G2 arrest but not apoptosis in AML cell lines without FLT3 mutations (THP-1 and U937). In MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells, PKC412 inactivates Myt-1 and activates CDC25c, leading to the activation of CDC2. Activated CDC2 phosphorylates Bad at serine-128 and facilitates its translocation to the mitochondria, where Bad triggers apoptosis. In contrast, PKC412 inactivates CDC2 by inducing serine-216 phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of CDC25c in THP-1 and U937 cells. As a result, cells are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, but do not undergo apoptosis because Bad is not activated. The FLT3 mutation-dependent differential cell cycle effect of PKC412 is considered an important factor when PKC412 is combined with cell cycle-specific anticancer drugs in the treatment of cancer and leukemia.","['Odgerel, T', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Wada, T', 'Shimizu, R', 'Futaki, K', 'Kano, Y', 'Furukawa, Y']","['Odgerel T', 'Kikuchi J', 'Wada T', 'Shimizu R', 'Futaki K', 'Kano Y', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071210,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210980 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210980 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 May 15;27(22):3102-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210980.

Primary ATL cells frequently express CCR4 at high levels. Since HTLV-1 Tax does not induce CCR4 expression, transcription factor(s) constitutively active in ATL may be responsible for its strong expression. We identified an activator protein-1 (AP-1) site in the CCR4 promoter as the major positive regulatory element in ATL cells. Among the AP-1 family members, Fra-2, JunB and JunD are highly expressed in fresh primary ATL cells. Consistently, the Fra-2/JunB and Fra-2/JunD heterodimers strongly activated the CCR4 promoter in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, Fra-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or JunD siRNA, but not JunB siRNA, effectively reduced CCR4 expression and cell growth in ATL cells. Conversely, Fra-2 or JunD overexpression promoted cell growth in Jurkat cells. We identified 49 genes, including c-Myb, BCL-6 and MDM2, which were downregulated by Fra-2 siRNA in ATL cells. c-Myb, BCL-6 and MDM2 were also downregulated by JunD siRNA. As Fra-2, these proto-oncogenes were highly expressed in primary ATL cells but not in normal CD4+ T cells.

However, their curative mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that Wogonin, derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Huang-Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi), induces apoptosis in malignant T cells in vitro and suppresses growth of human T-cell leukemia xenografts in vivo. Importantly, Wogonin shows almost no toxicity on T lymphocytes from healthy donors. Wogonin induces prolonged activation of PLCgamma1 via H(2)O(2) signaling in malignant T cells, which leads to sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) in malignant but not normal T cells. Subsequently, a Ca(2+) overload leads to disruption of the mitochondrial membrane. The selective effect of Wogonin is due to its differential regulation of the redox status of malignant versus normal T cells. In addition, we show that the L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are involved in the intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in T cells. Furthermore, we show that malignant T cells possess elevated amounts of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels compared with normal T cells, which further enhance the cytotoxicity of Wogonin for malignant T cells. Taken together, our data show a therapeutic potential of Wogonin for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Baumann, Sven', 'Fas, Stefanie C', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Muller, Wolfgang W', 'Merling, Anette', 'Gulow, Karsten', 'Edler, Lutz', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Baumann S', 'Fas SC', 'Giaisi M', 'Muller WW', 'Merling A', 'Gulow K', 'Edler L', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumorimmunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Flavanones)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Flavanones/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/pathology']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)44635-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-096198 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2354-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-096198.

We find that the human MYB locus is flanked by 257-bp Alu repeats and that the duplication is mediated somatically by homologous recombination between the flanking Alu elements on sister chromatids. Nested long-range PCR analysis indicated a low frequency of homologous recombination leading to MYB tandem duplication in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of approximately 50% of healthy individuals, none of whom had a MYB duplication in the germline.

Tax function is strictly dependent upon the cellular transcription factor CREB, and together they bind cAMP response elements within the viral promoter and mediate high-level viral transcription. Signal-dependent CREB phosphorylation at Ser(133) (pCREB) correlates with the activation of transcription. This activation has been attributed to recruitment of the coactivators CBP/p300 via physical interaction with the KIX domain. Here we show that the promoter-bound Tax/pCREB complex strongly recruits the recombinant, purified full-length coactivators CBP and p300. Additionally, the promoter-bound Tax/pCREB (but not Tax/CREB) complex recruits native p300 and potently activates transcription from chromatin templates. Unexpectedly, pCREB alone failed to detectably recruit the full-length coactivators, despite strong binding to KIX. These observations are in marked contrast to those in published studies that have characterized the physical interaction between KIX and pCREB and extrapolated these results to the full-length proteins. Consistent with our observation that pCREB is deficient for binding of CBP/p300, pCREB alone failed to support transcriptional activation. These data reveal that phosphorylation of CREB is not sufficient for CBP/p300 recruitment and transcriptional activation. The regulation of transcription by pCREB is therefore more complex than is generally recognized, and coregulators, such as Tax, likely play a critical role in the modulation of pCREB function.","['Geiger, Timothy R', 'Sharma, Neelam', 'Kim, Young-Mi', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Geiger TR', 'Sharma N', 'Kim YM', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Campus Box 1870, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071210,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Response Elements', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01657-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01657-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Feb;28(4):1383-92. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01657-07.

CFO and ISO inhibited cell proliferation with 48 h IC50 of approximately 30 and 20 microg/ml, respectively. Both induced concentration dependent strong and early apoptosis as measured by various end-points, e.g. annexinV binding, DNA laddering, apoptotic bodies formation and an increase in hypo diploid sub-G0 DNA content during the early 6h period of study. This could be because of early surge in ROS formation with concurrent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential observed. Both CFO and ISO activated apical death receptors TNFR1, DR4 and caspase-8 activity. Simultaneously, both increased the expression of mitochondrial cytochrome c protein with its concomitant release to cytosol leading to caspase-9 activation, suggesting thereby the involvement of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Further, Bax translocation, and decrease in nuclear NF-kappaB expression predict multi-target effects of the essential oil and ISO while both appeared to follow similar signaling apoptosis pathways. The easy and abundant availability of the oil combined with its suggested mechanism of cytotoxicity make CFO highly useful in the development of anti-cancer therapeutics.","['Kumar, Ajay', 'Malik, Fayaz', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Sethi, Vijay K', 'Shahi, Ashok K', 'Kaur, Jagdeep', 'Taneja, Subhash C', 'Qazi, Ghulam N', 'Singh, Jaswant']","['Kumar A', 'Malik F', 'Bhushan S', 'Sethi VK', 'Shahi AK', 'Kaur J', 'Taneja SC', 'Qazi GN', 'Singh J']","['Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071024,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (isointermedeol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8/biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cymbopogon/chemistry', 'Cytochromes c/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/*biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(07)00302-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2007.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2008 Feb 15;171(3):332-47. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2007.10.003.

However, some accept only values from venous blood. This study compares capillary and venous blood counts to verify the hypothesis that they are equivalent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed 463 capillary (fingerstick) and venous blood samples from 428 adults of both sexes (71% haematologic patients, 29% potential blood and apheresis donors). Both samples were taken at the same time from each subject. Haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, red blood cells (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH) and mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC) were measured using a haematology analyser (Advia 120, Bayer). RESULTS: Capillary Hb, Hct, WBC, RBC, MCV and MCH were all significantly higher than the venous values [+0.2 mmol/l (+0.3 g/dl), +0.02 l/l (+2%), +0.2 x 10(9)/l, +0.1 x 10(12)/l, +3.1 fl and +0.01 fmol, respectively], whereas the capillary MCHC was lower (-0.6 mmol/l). There was no difference in platelets (-1 x 10(9)/l). Capillary Hb and Hct values were higher in patients with anaemia and polycythaemia, respectively. However, no significant differences occurred in severe thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: In adult haematologic patients, however, only the differences in Hb and Hct values may be of clinical relevance. For potential blood and apheresis donors, Hb and platelet screening are equivalent with either capillary and venous blood using a haematology analyser.","['Schalk, E', 'Heim, M U', 'Koenigsmann, M', 'Jentsch-Ullrich, K']","['Schalk E', 'Heim MU', 'Koenigsmann M', 'Jentsch-Ullrich K']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Magdeburg, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany. enrico.schalk@med.ovgu.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Blood Cell Count/*methods', 'Blood Specimen Collection/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/blood']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['VOX978 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1423-0410.2007.00978.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vox Sang. 2007 Nov;93(4):348-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1423-0410.2007.00978.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to investigate in a cohort of 84 MDS patients the correlation of cutaneous findings with immunologic parameters and prognostic features of MDS in order to clarify their potential clinical significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a cohort of 84 newly diagnosed MDS patients in order to assess the cutaneous findings present at the time of diagnosis and during 1 to 3 years of follow-up. We described the clinical variety of cutaneous findings ascertained by histology. We also looked for any association between the group of MDS patients with skin manifestations and MDS subtype, immunologic and prognostic features highlighting transformation to acute leukaemia. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients presented cutaneous manifestations: 1 patient developed leukaemia cutis, 6 patients photosensitivity not associated with autoimmune disease, 3 prurigo nodularis, 2 Sweet's syndrome, 6 leucocytoclastic vasculitis, 2 ecchymoses and purpura associated with preexisting relapsing polychondritis, 1 patient subcutaneous nodules associated with Wegener's granulomatosis and 1 patient with malar rash and oral ulcers associated with preexisting systemic lupus erythematosus. Adjusted for age and gender, the presence of skin findings constitutes a significant predictor of the high-risk MDS subgroup (odds ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-10.92). Hypergammaglobulinemia was significantly higher in the MDS subgroup with skin manifestations (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Most MDS patients with cutaneous manifestations belong to the high-risk MDS subgroup and present hypergammaglobulinemia.

In the present study, we characterized the binding of 332-01 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), a number of human leukaemic and monocytic cell lines, and beta2m gene-deleted murine lymphocytes. dbeta2m was found to be expressed on non-activated and activated monocytes. When cells were pre-exposed to dbeta2m, 332-01 also bound to non-activated T lymphocytes. dbeta2m was expressed on the monocytic cell lines U937 and TIB-202, and binding was significantly increased when cells were pre-incubated with dbeta2m and when TIB-202 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide. dbeta2m was also expressed on T leukaemic Jurkat cells as well as on low HLA-expressing erythroleukaemic K562 cells. beta2m gene-deleted murine splenocytes only bound 332-01 after pre-exposure to dbeta2m. Binding of 332-01 antibody could not be displaced by addition of high concentrations of native beta2m. In conclusion, our data indicate that dbeta2m - in contrast to native beta2m - binds to a hitherto unknown cell surface receptor independent of classical MHC class I molecules. As beta2m has previously been shown to display biological activities such as the induction of both growth promotion and apoptosis, C1 complement activity, shown to mediate cleavage of beta2m, could be involved in these processes.","['Wang, M', 'Corlin, D B', 'Heegaard, N H H', 'Claesson, M H', 'Nissen, M H']","['Wang M', 'Corlin DB', 'Heegaard NH', 'Claesson MH', 'Nissen MH']","['Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Department of International Health, Immunology and Microbiology, The Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071207,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'U937 Cells', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/biosynthesis/*immunology/metabolism']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['SJI2044 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2007.02044.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2008 Feb;67(2):105-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2007.02044.x.

Unlike other tumor suppressors, the p27 gene is rarely mutated in tumors. Therefore misregulation of p27, rather than loss of the gene, is responsible for tumor-associated decreases in p27 protein levels. We performed a functional genomic screen in p27(+/-) mice to identify genes that regulate p27 during lymphomagenesis. This study demonstrated that decreased p27 expression in tumors resulted from altered transcription of the p27 gene, and the retroviral tagging strategy enabled us to pinpoint relevant transcription factors. inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (Id3) was isolated and validated as a transcriptional repressor of p27. We further demonstrated that p27 was a downstream target of Id3 in src-family kinase Lck-driven thymic lymphomagenesis and that p27 was an essential regulator of Lck-dependent thymic maturation during normal T-cell development. Thus, we have identified and characterized transcriptional repression of p27 by Id3 as a new mechanism decreasing p27 protein in tumors.","['Garrett-Engele, Carrie M', 'Tasch, Michael A', 'Hwang, Harry C', 'Fero, Matthew L', 'Perlmutter, Roger M', 'Clurman, Bruce E', 'Roberts, James M']","['Garrett-Engele CM', 'Tasch MA', 'Hwang HC', 'Fero ML', 'Perlmutter RM', 'Clurman BE', 'Roberts JM']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '135845-89-5 (Idb3 protein, mouse)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2006/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['06-PLGE-RA-0434 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pgen.0030219 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2007 Dec;3(12):e219. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030219.,,PMC2134944,"['F32 CA094655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA0947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA094655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Competing interests.

The records of 202 patients with brucellosis were evaluated retrospectively. Among these cases of brucellosis seen in a 6 year period between April 1999 and June 2005, 30 patients with pancytopenia were identified. The most common manifestation was fever, followed by weight loss, anorexia, malaise, arthralgia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone marrow biopsies revealed hypercellularity or normocellularity. The most common findings in the bone marrow evaluation were histiocytic hemophagocytosis and granulomas. Among all cases, we diagnosed 5 hematological malignancies (1 acute myelogenous leukemia, 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 2 multiple myeloma) concurrently with brucellosis. The clinical symptoms and findings were similar in patients with and without malignancies. In cases with malignancies, the bone marrow biopsy revealed predominant primary disease involvement. Significant increases in ESR and CRP, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in patients with malignancies. Peripheral blood counts in patients without malignancies returned to normal after antibiotic treatment for brucellosis. However, pancytopenia in two patients with malignancies did not recover because of primary resistant disease. We conclude that while histiocytic hemophagocytosis may be considered as a major cause of pancytopenia, leukemic infiltration can also be an extreme and unusual cause of pancytopenia in patients in whom brucellosis was concurrently diagnosed with hematological malignancies.","['Sari, Ismail', 'Altuntas, Fevzi', 'Hacioglu, Sibel', 'Kocyigit, Ismail', 'Sevinc, Alper', 'Sacar, Suzan', 'Deniz, Kemal', 'Alp, Emine', 'Eser, Bulent', 'Yildiz, Orhan', 'Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Unal, Ali', 'Cetin, Mustafa']","['Sari I', 'Altuntas F', 'Hacioglu S', 'Kocyigit I', 'Sevinc A', 'Sacar S', 'Deniz K', 'Alp E', 'Eser B', 'Yildiz O', 'Kaynar L', 'Unal A', 'Cetin M']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Pamukkale University, Denizli, Turkey. hisari@pau.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agglutination Tests', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Brucellosis/blood/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/complications/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/complications/pathology', 'Pancytopenia/blood/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/12 09:00,2008/06/14 09:00,['2007/12/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21098 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Apr;83(4):334-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21098.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effectiveness of this approach may be constrained by insufficient information regarding the fate of the delivery vector within the confines of the endo-lysosomal network. Successful drug delivery through this mechanism is therefore dependent on an equal high level of understanding of the specific endocytic pathways that are inherent in the target cell and the traffic and fate of the macromolecule within endocytic organelles. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising candidate vectors for delivering macromolecules, however, there is little consensus regarding their exact mechanism of uptake. This review highlights the numerous endocytic pathways and sorting mechanisms that may deliver CPPs to a number of cellular destinations.

To test if Wnt signaling can regulate the self-renewal of both stem cells and cancer cells in the hematopoietic system, we developed mice that lack beta-catenin in their hematopoietic cells. Here we show that beta-catenin-deficient mice can form HSCs, but that these cells are deficient in long-term growth and maintenance. Moreover, beta-catenin deletion causes a profound reduction in the ability of mice to develop BCR-ABL-induced chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), while allowing progression of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).

Age is one of the significant prognostic indicators in DS-AML. The prognostic factor of gene alterations has not been reported in older DS-AML patients. We here describe the case of a 7-year-old DS boy with AML-M2, who had no history of transient abnormal myelopoiesis or any clinical poor prognostic factors, such as high white blood cell counts or extramedullary infiltration.

It results in juxtaposition of the 5' part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3' part of the ABL1 gene (previously ABL) on chromosome 9. CML is clinically characterized by three distinct phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Blast crisis is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), with secondary chromosomal abnormalities present. We report a case of myeloid blast crisis of CML resistant to imatinib mesylate and chemotherapy. By use of cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and comparative genomic hybridization methods, we identified a cluster of BCR-ABL amplification on inverted duplication of the Ph chromosome with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and increased genomic levels of the RUNX1 gene (previously AML1). The t(3;21)(q26;q22) is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in some cases of CML blast phase and in treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Amplification or copy number increase of RUNX1 has been reported in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our study indicated that the progenitor of CML was BCR-ABL dependent through the amplification of Ph chromosome as a mechanism of resistance to imatinib therapy.

Cytogenetic and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected several chromosomal abnormalities that included an amplification of 9p.

JAK2(V617F) mutation status was quantitatively assessed by allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Although crossing points analysis showed JAK2(V617F) mutated alleles at 52%, it is still impossible to describe conclusively the mutational status of the amplified JAK2 gene within the sole homogeneously staining region, because total genomic DNA was extracted for the analysis and not only DNA from cells with the homogeneously staining region.

In this study, we compared the expression profile of various cytokines and chemokines in distal nerves after capsaicin-induced degeneration of unmyelinated axons to Wallerian degeneration induced by nerve transection. Upregulation of MCP-1, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 were seen in both groups but IL-1ss and LIF were primarily upregulated in Wallerian degeneration of the whole nerve and not in capsaicin-induced degeneration of unmyelinated axons. The activated macrophage response, as measured by an increase in ED-1 immunostaining, was more prominent in the transected sciatic nerves compared to capsaicin-treated nerves.

However, no method for direct detection of the plasma viral load has yet been reported. In this study, a TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was established for the rapid detection and quantitation of FLV. Measurement of the absolute FLV load was achieved through synthesis of a standard RNA from within the FLV envelope gene for generation of a standard curve. The assay allows quantitation over a range from 20 to 2 x 10(8) RNA copies per reaction in a two-step real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR protocol. The relationships between the initially injected FLV dose and the plasma FLV load and spleen index were explored. Following this, the in vivo effects of zidovudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and entecavir on mice infected with FLV were evaluated. The results showed that the plasma FLV load was not proportional to the spleen index over the same FLV injection dosage series, although a trend was observed. When evaluated using plasma viral load, high dose (15 mg/(kg d)) adefovir dipivoxil was capable of significant inhibition of FLV replication in mice. The qRT-PCR assay described here allows specific, sensitive and direct detection of FLV and may also provide more precise measurement of FLV load.","['He, Jin-Yang', 'Cheng, Hui-Jun', 'Wang, Yan-Fang', 'Zhu, Yu-Tong', 'Li, Guo-Qiao']","['He JY', 'Cheng HJ', 'Wang YF', 'Zhu YT', 'Li GQ']","['Laboratory of Clinical and Basic Study, Tropical Medicine Institute, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Jichang Road No. 12, Guangzhou City 510405, Guangdong Province, China. sunny12345678_89@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Viral/*blood', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy/*virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy/*virology', '*Viral Load', 'Viremia']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0166-0934(07)00410-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2008 Feb;147(2):345-50. doi: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.10.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the antitumor and immunostimulating activities of beta-glucan (IS-2) purified from mutated S. cerevisiae, we made an experiment on innate immune response against metastasis of cancer cells by comparing with the beta-glucan from wild-type S. cerevisiae. In experimental lung metastasis of colon 26-M3.1 carcinoma or B16-BL6 melanoma cells, prophylactic administration of beta-glucan purified from mutated S. cerevisiae significantly inhibited lung metastasis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, therapeutic administration of IS-2 also significantly inhibited the colon 26-M3.1 cell growth in mice. In an assay of liver and spleen metastasis produced by i.v. inoculation of L5178Y-ML25 lymphoma cells, IS-2 also significantly inhibited metastasis in CDF1 mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with IS-2 two days before tumor inoculation significantly prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. In an in vitro cytotoxicity analysis, IS-2 (up to 100 microg/ml) did not affect the growth of colon 26-M3.1 cells. In contrast, IS-2 enhanced splenocyte proliferating activity in a dose-dependent manner. Peritoneal macrophages stimulated with IS-2 produced various cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and IL-12. In addition, treatment with IS-2 (20 microg/mouse) induced tumoricidal activity of peritoneal macrophages against colon 26-M3.1 cells. In an assay for natural killer (NK) cell activity, IS-2 (20 microg/mouse, i.v.) significantly augmented NK cytotoxicity against Yac-1 tumor cells at 2 days after IS-2 treatment. The depletion of NK cells by injection of rabbit anti-asialo GM1 serum abolished the inhibitory effect of IS-2 on lung metastasis of colon 26-M3.1 cells. These data suggest that IS-2 inhibits tumor metastasis via activation of macrophages and NK cells.","['Yoon, Taek Joon', 'Kim, Tack Joong', 'Lee, Hwa', 'Shin, Kwang Soon', 'Yun, Yeo Pyo', 'Moon, Won Kook', 'Kim, Dong Woo', 'Lee, Kwang Ho']","['Yoon TJ', 'Kim TJ', 'Lee H', 'Shin KS', 'Yun YP', 'Moon WK', 'Kim DW', 'Lee KH']","['Bio-Food and Drug Research Center and Department of Biotechnology, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 380-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071030,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,['0 (beta-Glucans)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Leukemia L5178/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/*secondary/*therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/metabolism/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutagenesis', 'Rabbits', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'beta-Glucans/*isolation & purification/*therapeutic use']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(07)00315-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2007.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2008 Jan;8(1):36-42. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2007.10.005.

Rhenium-188-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody has been used successfully in patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Our aim was to establish the biokinetics of (188)Re-anti-CD20 in patients and to evaluate its dosimetry as a target-specific radiopharmaceutical for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) radioimmunotherapy. METHODS: Whole-body images were acquired at various times after administration of (188)Re-anti-CD20, obtained from instant freeze-dried kit formulations with radiochemical purity >95%. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around source organs in each time frame. The cpm of each ROI was converted to activity using the conjugate view counting method. The image sequence was used to extrapolate time-activity curves in each organ to calculate the total number of disintegrations (N) that occurred in the source regions. N data were the input for the OLINDA/EXM code to calculate internal radiation dose estimates. RESULTS: Dosimetric studies indicated that after administration of 4.87-8.72 GBq of (188)Re-anti-CD20, the absorbed dose to total body would be 0.75 Gy, which corresponds with the recommended dose for NHL therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The calculated absorbed doses of (188)Re-anti-CD20 indicate that it may be used in radioimmunotherapy. Therefore, these preliminary data justify a full assessment of the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of (188)Re-anti-CD20 in a clinical study.","['Torres-Garcia, Eugenio', 'Ferro-Flores, Guillermina', 'Arteaga de Murphy, Consuelo', 'Correa-Gonzalez, Luis', 'Pichardo-Romero, Pablo A']","['Torres-Garcia E', 'Ferro-Flores G', 'Arteaga de Murphy C', 'Correa-Gonzalez L', 'Pichardo-Romero PA']","['Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071015,United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['0 (188Re-anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Rituximab', 'Whole Body Imaging', 'Whole-Body Counting']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0188-4409(07)00299-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcmed.2007.06.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2008 Jan;39(1):100-9. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2007.06.023.

Donor lymphocyte infusion using allogeneic T-cells is widely applied for the induction of GVHD, which is associated with the desired graft vs. leukemia effect. Due to the slow immune recovery, our objective was to accelerate the immune recovery post-BMT by B-cell injections. METHODS: T-cell-depleted stem cells obtained from female C57BL/6 (B6) mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated (Balb/c x C57BL/6) F-1 female mice. Seven days post-transplantation, murine B-cells of male C57BL/6 origin were infused into the T-cell-depleted chimeras. Thirty and 60 days post-transplantation, PCR analysis of the Y-chromosome was carried out to detect male B-cells in the transplant recipients. In order to evaluate the specific antibody response, the donors were immunized by specific T-cell-dependent and -independent antigens. RESULTS: None of the T-cell-depleted transplanted mice developed GVHD during a follow-up period of 650 days, whereas all non-T-cell-depleted recipients died. At 60 days post-transplantation, significantly higher levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG1, IgG3 isotypes) were seen in chimeras supplemented with male B-cells than in chimeras reconstituted with T-cell-depleted stem cells alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our data document the feasibility of administering B-cell therapy post-allogeneic BMT to improve recovery of the humeral arm of the immune system while avoiding GVHD. Furthermore, post-transplant B-cell administration may have an important impact as an alternative to IV immunoglobulin infusions.","['Samuel, Simcha', 'Azar, Yehudith', 'Corchia, Nataly', 'Or, Reuven']","['Samuel S', 'Azar Y', 'Corchia N', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070924,United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*transplantation', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*methods', 'Chimerism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Immune System/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Regeneration', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology/methods']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0188-4409(07)00240-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcmed.2007.06.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2008 Jan;39(1):61-8. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2007.06.018.

These patients were divided into two groups: the study group, including 237 patients who had hematological disorders included myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and lymphoma and the control group including 355 patients with no evidence of hematological disease. Both conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization using DNA probes specific for the centromere of chromosomes X or Y were performed according to our standard laboratory protocols. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 237 patients with hematological disorders (10.1%) had Y chromosome loss. Of these 24 patients, 2 patients had AML (5.0% of all AML patients), 2 patients had CML (5.7% of all CML patients), 2 patients had MPD (8.0% of all MPD patients), 3 patients had MM (10.0% of all MM patients), 5 patients had lymphoma (10.6% of all lymphoma patients) and 10 patients had MDS (16.7% of all MDS patients). Twenty-one out of these 24 patients had a loss of Y chromosome as the sole anomaly and the remaining three had a loss of Y chromosome accompanied with other structural changes detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed the routine cytogenetic results. All 24 patients had a loss of Y chromosome with a range of 17.5% - 98.5% of cells. Two of the patients, one with AML and another with CML, had karyotype and FISH testing done both at the initial diagnosis and during remission. The results showed a loss of Y chromosome at initial diagnosis but a normal 46, XY karyotype during remission. Only 9 out of 355 patients (2.5%) without evidence of hematological disease had Y chromosome loss, among them 7 patients had cardiovascular diseases and 2 patients had kidney diseases. Comparison of the incidence of Y chromosome loss in patients with hematological disorders or without evidence of hematological disease using statistical analysis showed a statistically significance difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that the frequency of Y chromosome loss is significantly higher in patients with hematological disorders than in patients without hematological disorders, which indicates that the loss of Y chromosome is associated with a neoplastic change.","['Zhang, Li-jun', 'Shin, Eun Sim', 'Yu, Zhong-xing', 'Li, Shi-bo']","['Zhang LJ', 'Shin ES', 'Yu ZX', 'Li SB']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA. lzhang202003@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/01/18 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2007 Nov 20;120(22):2002-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The major biologic effects of imiquimod are mediated through agonistic activity towards toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and consecutively, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). The result of this activity is the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators leading to activation of antigen-presenting cells and other components of innate immunity and, eventually, the mounting of a profound T-helper (Th1)-weighted antitumoral cellular immune response. Several secondary effects on the molecular and cellular level may also be explained, at least in part, by the activation of NF-kappaB. Moreover, independent of TLR-7 and TLR-8, imiquimod appears to interfere with adenosine receptor signalling pathways, and the compound causes receptor-independent reduction of adenylyl cyclase activity. This novel mechanism may augment the pro-inflammatory activity of the compound through suppression of a negative regulatory feedback mechanism which normally limits inflammatory responses. Finally, imiquimod induces apoptosis of tumour cells at higher concentrations. The pro-apoptotic activity of imiquimod involves caspase activation and appears to depend on B cell lymphoma/leukemia protein (Bcl)-2 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, imiquimod acts on several levels, which appear to synergistically underlie the profound antitumoral activity of the compound.","['Schon, M P', 'Schon, M']","['Schon MP', 'Schon M']","['Rudolf Virchow Center, DFG Research Center for Experimental Biomedicine and Department of Dermatology, Julius-Maximilians-University, Wurzburg, Germany. michael.schoen@virchow.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Toll-Like Receptors/agonists']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJD8265 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.08265.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2007 Dec;157 Suppl 2:8-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.08265.x.,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The case-control method was used, taking into consideration the age at first menstruation, cycle regularity, duration of menstruation and discharge quantity. The case group included 160 mothers with children suffering from ALL and the control group included 160 mothers having healthy children of the same age and sex. RESULTS: Alterations of the menstrual function in mothers of patients with ALL occur with statistically higher rate as compared with mothers having healthy children. Mothers of pediatric patients with ALL showed later menarche (>or= 15 years of age), reduced (to 2 days) or prolonged (over 6 days) menses duration, as well as irregularity of the menstrual cycle combined with prolonged menses duration. CONCLUSION: Menstrual disorders in mothers of child ren with ALL occur with reliably higher frequency as compared with women having healthy children. A common origin of both events (predisposition to malignancies and menstrual disorders) is suggested pointing to inherited genomic instability.","['Kitsera, N', 'Akopjan, H', 'Polishchuk, R', 'Helner, N']","['Kitsera N', 'Akopjan H', 'Polishchuk R', 'Helner N']","['Institute of Hereditary Pathology, Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Lviv, Ukraine. natandi@complex.lviv.ua']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Menarche', 'Menstruation', 'Menstruation Disturbances/complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Mothers', 'Ovum/growth & development', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/genetics']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2007 Oct-Dec;12(4):483-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population-based matched controls (1:3) were selected from the corresponding registrar's office. Residential proximity to the nearest nuclear power plant was determined for each subject individually (with a precision of about 25 m). The report is focused on leukaemia and mainly on cases in the inner 5-km zone around the plants. The study includes 593 leukaemia cases and 1,766 matched controls. All leukaemia combined show a statistically significant trend for 1/distance with a positive regression coefficient of 1.75 [lower 95%-confidence limit (CL): 0.65]; for acute lymphoid leukaemia 1.63 (lower 95%-CL: 0.39), for acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia 1.99 (lower 95%-CL: -0.41). This indicates a negative trend for distance. Cases live closer to nuclear power plants than the randomly selected controls. A categorical analysis shows a statistically significant odds ratio of 2.19 (lower 95%-CL: 1.51) for residential proximity within 5 km compared to residence outside this area. This result is largely attributed to cases in previous studies of the GCCR (especially in the inner zone) as there is clearly some overlap between those studies. The result was not to be expected under current radiation-epidemiological knowledge. Considering that there is no evidence of relevant accidents and that possible confounders could not be identified, the observed positive distance trend remains unexplained.","['Kaatsch, Peter', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Schulze-Rath, Renate', 'Schmiedel, Sven', 'Blettner, Maria']","['Kaatsch P', 'Spix C', 'Schulze-Rath R', 'Schmiedel S', 'Blettner M']","['Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, German Childhood Cancer Registry, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, 55131 Mainz, Germany. kaatsch@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Odds Ratio', '*Power Plants', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/01/18 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23330 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Feb 15;122(4):721-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23330.,,,,,['Int J Cancer. 2008 Feb 15;122(4):x-xi.

Significant variability in the antitumor efficacy and systemic toxicity of Ara-C has been observed in cancer patients. Two missense mutations changing Ara-C sensitivity and toxicity had been found in the human CDA. Coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) of CDA had been investigated in Japanese, Europeans Africans and Americans, but not in Chinese. The purpose of this study was to survey the allelic frequencies of CDA cSNPs in Chinese children. METHODS: The bone marrow samples from 87 childhood patients with acute leukemia and peripheral blood samples from 199 non-malignancy-bearing children were obtained to prepare complementary DNAs (cDNAs). The cDNAs were analyzed for the polymorphisms in CDA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct-sequencing. The distributive difference of each genotype was evaluated between children with acute leukemia and control children. RESULTS: Three known different polymorphisms, namely, 79A to C (K27Q), 208G to A (A70T) and 435T to C (silent) were identified in the coding region of CDA from the investigated Chinese population and displayed allelic frequencies of 12.1%, 0.52% and 76.2%, respectively. No association with susceptibility to disease was observed. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates 3 cSNPs and their allelic frequencies of CDA in Chinese children, and provides the first step to identify genetic markers for predicting variability in Ara-C response and toxicity.","['Yue, Li-jie', 'Chen, Xiao-wen', 'Li, Cheng-rong', 'Li, Chang-gang', 'Shi, Hong-song', 'Zhang, Min']","['Yue LJ', 'Chen XW', 'Li CR', 'Li CG', 'Shi HS', 'Zhang M']","[""Pediatrics Institute of Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518026 P.

FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) represent the majority of FLT3 mutations (25 - 30%) while FLT3-TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutations can be found in about 7% of AML patients. In this study, we addressed the question whether especially primary AML cells carrying FLT3-ITD mutations show differences in terms of their protein expression pattern compared to FLT3 wild-type blasts. We investigated bone marrow samples that were isolated at diagnosis from 36 AML patients expressing either FLT3 wild-type (n = 16) or an activating FLT3 mutation (FLT3-ITD, n = 15; FLT3-TKD, n = 5). Proteomic analysis was performed by means of surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry which has shown its high efficiency in finding biomarkers in solid tumors. Here, we demonstrate that a large series of proteins is differently expressed in primary AML blasts harboring FLT3-ITD mutations. Furthermore, there are also significant differences of the protein expression profile between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations. Interestingly, further analysis of FLT3-ITD positive AML according to its response to the induction chemotherapy demonstrates putative prognostic markers for this subgroup of AML. We suggest that SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry represents a promising tool of proteomic analysis of AML that might help to establish new prognostic markers in AML.","['Scholl, Sebastian', 'Melle, Christian', 'Bleul, Annett', 'Spies-Weisshart, Baerbel', 'Kunert, Christa', 'Hoffken, Klaus', 'von Eggeling, Ferdinand']","['Scholl S', 'Melle C', 'Bleul A', 'Spies-Weisshart B', 'Kunert C', 'Hoffken K', 'von Eggeling F']","['Department of Internal Medicine II (Oncology and Hematology), Institute of Human Genetics and Anthropology at Universitatsklinikum, Jena, Germany. sebastian.scholl@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['788242861 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701671036 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Dec;48(12):2418-23. doi: 10.1080/10428190701671036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fludarabine/treosulfan regimen can be considered a fully intensive, modified myeloablative regimen with effective antileukemia activity and acceptable toxicity in patients with AML/MDS not eligible for standard myeloablation, and merits further study in larger scale studies.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Hardan, Izhar', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Rand, Avital', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Hardan I', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Rand A', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Nagler A']","['The Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. ashimoni@sheba.health.gov.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['788262790 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701671051 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Dec;48(12):2352-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190701671051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance can be classified as BCR-ABL-dependent (e.g., mutation in the BCR-ABL gene) or BCR-ABL-independent (alternative pathways of disease progression, e.g., SRC-family tyrosine kinases). The investigation of therapeutic options post-imatinib failure resulted in the development and regulatory approval of dasatinib, a BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinase inhibitor. Dasatinib is active across all phases of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and demonstrates activity in almost all imatinib-resistant mutations. Other therapeutic options are also under investigation, with nilotinib being the most clinically advanced. Nilotinib is an analog of imatinib with similar multiple kinase targets, but without inhibition of SRC, and reduced in vitro activity against BCR-ABL P-loop mutations compared with dasatinib. Similar to dasatinib, nilotinib has no activity against T315I mutations. The availability of dasatinib and development of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors provide positive prospects for patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML. Here, we discuss several of these new strategies for treating patients after imatinib failure.","['Kujawski, Lisa', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kujawski L', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0843, USA. kuj@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['788265916 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701665988 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Dec;48(12):2310-22. doi: 10.1080/10428190701665988.,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We developed a data warehouse system for cost analysis using data from the hospital central data warehouse system. The balance data of patients who were discharged from Kagoshima University Hospital from April 2003 to March 2005 were determined in terms of medical procedure, cost per day and patient admission in order to conduct a drill-down analysis. To evaluate this system, we analyzed cash flow by DPC category of patients who were categorized as having malignant tumors and whose DPC category was reevaluated in 2004. RESULTS: The percentages of medical expenses were highest in patients with acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and particularly in patients with malignant tumors of the liver and intrahepatic bile duct. Imaging tests degraded the percentages of medical expenses in Kagoshima University Hospital. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that cost analysis by patient is important for hospital administration in the inclusive evaluation system using a case-mix index such as DPC.","['Muranaga, F', 'Kumamoto, I', 'Uto, Y']","['Muranaga F', 'Kumamoto I', 'Uto Y']","['Department of Medical Informatics, Kagoshima University Hospital, Sakuragaoka 8-35-1, Kagoshima City 890-8520, Japan. f-mura@m.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Methods Inf Med,Methods of information in medicine,0210453,,IM,"['Computers', '*Costs and Cost Analysis', '*Databases as Topic', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups/*economics', '*Health Care Costs', 'Hospital Administration/*economics', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Liver Neoplasms/economics', 'Software']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['07060679 [pii]'],ppublish,Methods Inf Med. 2007;46(6):679-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thermal treatment of ginseng leaf resulted in production of both Rh2 and Rg3 content that was confirmed by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Flow cytometry of cells stained with annexin V - fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide showed that the LFRh2 significantly (p < or = 0.05) increased apoptosis (18% +/- 0.4%) after 23 h at a concentration that inhibited cell viability by 50% (LC50 (72 h) = 52 microg/mL. In comparison, a similar significant (p < or = 0.05) increase in apoptotic cell numbers occurred at 41 h of exposure for pure ginsenoside standards, PD (LC50 (72 h) = 13 microg/mL), PT (LC50 (72 h) = 19 microg/mL), and Rh2 (LC50 (72 h) = 15 microg/mL). Although no further increase in apoptosis was observed in THP-1 cells after exposure to increasing concentrations of LFRh2 and pure Rh2, PD, and PT standards, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of necrotic cells did occur after exposure of cells to different ginsenosides at elevated concentrations. THP-1 caspase-3 activity was greatest (p <or= 0.05) with Rh2 (7.6 +/- 1.1 nmol/L pNA), followed by LFRh2 (5.9 +/- 1.0 nmol/L pNA) and PT (5.0 +/- 0.8 nmol/L pNA), whereas PD was similar to control cells. We define for the first time the proportion of apoptotic to necrotic events that characterize the relative cytotoxicity and reduced cell proliferation of different ginsenosides in cultured THP-1 cells. Moreover, thermal treatment of North American ginseng leaf produced a marked transformation of ginsenoside, largely attributable to an increase in Rh2 content. This change was associated with cytotoxic properties in THP-1 cell that were related to alterations in cell membrane properties, which were also obtained with the pure ginsenosides PD, PT, and Rh2.","['Kitts, David D', 'Popovich, David G', 'Hu, Chun']","['Kitts DD', 'Popovich DG', 'Hu C']","['Food, Nutrition and Health, University of British Columbia, 2205 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada. ddkitts@interchange.ubc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '78214-33-2 (ginsenoside Rh2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Panax/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['y07-099 [pii]', '10.1139/Y07-099 [doi]']",ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 2007 Nov;85(11):1173-83. doi: 10.1139/Y07-099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paired-box transcription factor Pax7 is required for satellite cells to generate committed myogenic progenitors. In this study we undertook a multi-level approach to define the role of Pax7 in satellite cell function. Using comparative microarray analysis, we identified several novel and strongly regulated targets; in particular, we identified Myf5 as a gene whose expression was regulated by Pax7. Using siRNA, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies we confirmed that Myf5 is directly regulated by Pax7 in myoblasts derived from satellite cells. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry were used to purify Pax7 together with its co-factors. This revealed that Pax7 associates with the Wdr5-Ash2L-MLL2 histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex that directs methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4, refs 4-10). Binding of the Pax7-HMT complex to Myf5 resulted in H3K4 tri-methylation of surrounding chromatin. Thus, Pax7 induces chromatin modifications that stimulate transcriptional activation of target genes to regulate entry into the myogenic developmental programme.","['McKinnell, Iain W', 'Ishibashi, Jeff', 'Le Grand, Fabien', 'Punch, Vincent G J', 'Addicks, Gregory C', 'Greenblatt, Jack F', 'Dilworth, F Jeffrey', 'Rudnicki, Michael A']","['McKinnell IW', 'Ishibashi J', 'Le Grand F', 'Punch VG', 'Addicks GC', 'Greenblatt JF', 'Dilworth FJ', 'Rudnicki MA']","['Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research, Ottawa Health Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8L6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071209,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Ash2l protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wdr5 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Myoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncb1671 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1671 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2008 Jan;10(1):77-84. doi: 10.1038/ncb1671.

However, the cellular factors that regulate RA-induced myeloid differentiation are largely unknown, and other forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) do not respond to this differentiation therapy. A greater understanding of the molecules that positively or negatively regulate RA-induced differentiation should facilitate the development of more effective differentiation therapies. In this study, we investigated the potential role of Src family kinases (SFK) in the regulation of RA-induced gene expression and myeloid differentiation. We report that inhibition of SFKs markedly enhanced RA-induced differentiation in myeloid cell lines and primary AML cells, as assessed by flow-cytometric analysis of cell surface markers, morphologic analysis, and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. In addition, inhibition of SFKs enhanced expression from retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target genes encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon), PU.1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and cathepsin D. Moreover, a constitutively active Src inhibited RAR-dependent transcription, whereas a kinase-dead Src exerted little effect. These studies provide the first demonstration that SFKs act to negatively regulate RA-induced gene expression and myeloid differentiation and suggest that the combination of SFK inhibition and RA treatment may be therapeutically beneficial in AML.","['Miranda, Michelle B', 'Redner, Robert L', 'Johnson, Daniel E']","['Miranda MB', 'Redner RL', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213-1863, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20071207,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/03/20 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-07-0514 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0514 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Dec;6(12 Pt 1):3081-90. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0514.

Using the microarray technique, hundreds of genes have been documented to be potential Stat3 target genes in different cell types. However, only a small fraction of these genes have been proven to be true direct Stat3 target genes. Here we report the identification of novel direct Stat3 target genes using a genome-wide screening procedure based on the chromatin immunoprecipitation method. These novel Stat3 target genes are involved in a diverse array of biological processes such as oncogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. We show that Stat3 can act as both a repressor and activator on its direct target genes. We further show that most of the novel Stat3 direct target genes are dependent on Stat3 for their transcriptional regulation. In addition, using a physiological cell system, we demonstrate that Stat3 is required for the transcriptional regulation of two of the newly identified direct Stat3 target genes important for muscle differentiation.","['Snyder, Marylynn', 'Huang, Xin-Yun', 'Zhang, J Jillian']","['Snyder M', 'Huang XY', 'Zhang JJ']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071207,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers', 'Mice', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)69688-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M706976200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Feb 15;283(7):3791-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M706976200.

In man, immunophenotypic classification identifies distinct leukaemic types with different treatment strategies. Improved understanding and classification of equine LL may allow similar advances. OBJECTIVES: To document the clinical, immunophenotypic and functional characteristics in 6 cases of equine LL of T-cell origin. METHODS: The clinical records and pathological findings from 6 cases of equine LL were analysed. Immunohistochemistry to identify T or B lymphocytes was performed on paraffin embedded tissues in 4 cases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were phenotyped for expression of CD4, CD8, MHC class I and II and B-cell antigens in 4 cases using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and flow cytometry. Neoplastic lymphocytes from 4 horses were stimulated with mitogens. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Six horses of various breeds were identified with LL of T-cell origin. The clinical course and presenting signs varied. Neoplastic lymphocytes were identified in peripheral blood samples from all horses and tissue invasion was confirmed at examination post mortem in 4 horses. Immunophenotyping identified a predominance of CD3+ T-cells in lymphoid tissues and CD4+ T-cells in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the affected horses. Neoplastic lymphocytes from the 4 cases that were tested failed to proliferate in response to mitogens. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Characterisation of the clinical, pathological and immunological findings in 6 horses with LL has added to reports of this rare condition, characterised it in greater detail and therefore provides a starting point for further investigations.","['Rendle, D I', 'Durham, A E', 'Thompson, J C', 'Archer, J', 'Mitchell, M', 'Saunders, K', 'Millere, J', 'Paillot, R', 'Smith, K C', 'Kydd, J H']","['Rendle DI', 'Durham AE', 'Thompson JC', 'Archer J', 'Mitchell M', 'Saunders K', 'Millere J', 'Paillot R', 'Smith KC', 'Kydd JH']","['Liphook Equine Hospital, Forest Mere, Liphook, Hampshire GU30 7JG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Equine Vet J,Equine veterinary journal,0173320,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Horse Diseases/immunology/*pathology', 'Horses', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",2007/12/11 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/12/11 09:00'],"['2007/12/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['EVJ06173 [pii]', '10.2746/042516407X2163271 [doi]']",ppublish,Equine Vet J. 2007 Nov;39(6):522-8. doi: 10.2746/042516407X2163271.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential roles of different cancer therapies in the development of these risk factors are discussed. In addition, two other late effects that may affect cardiovascular health are discussed: late-onset anthracycline-induced left ventricular dysfunction and methotrexate-mediated elevations of homocysteine during therapy with the potential for endothelial dysfunction. Lastly, areas needing further investigation to elucidate these risks are highlighted.","['Oeffinger, Kevin C']",['Oeffinger KC'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA. oeffingk@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Obesity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21410 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Feb;50(2 Suppl):462-7; discussion 468. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21410.,57,,"['R01 CA100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100474-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sequenced DNA from a total of 810 primary malignancies, including pancreatic, lung, breast, and colon carcinomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia, as well as several neuroblastoma cell lines. From this large, diverse series, missense SOS1 mutations were identified in a single pancreatic tumor, one lung adenocarcinoma, and a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line.

Secondary chromosome changes are frequently described, although their clinical significance is not clear. In this study, we have collected and reviewed abnormal karyotypes from 88 patients with primary ESFT and a rearrangement of 22q12. Secondary changes were identified in 80% (70/88) of tumors at diagnosis. Multivariate analysis showed a worse overall and relapse free survival (RFS) for those with a complex karyotype (overall survival, P = 0.005; RFS, P = 0.04), independent of metastatic disease. Univariate survival analysis showed that a chromosome number above 50 or a complex karyotype was associated with a worse overall survival (>50 chromosomes, P = 0.05; complex karyotype, P = 0.04). There was no association between type of cytogenetic abnormality and the presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis of a small subgroup with trisomy 20 indicated that trisomy 20 was associated with a worse overall and RFS. There was no difference in outcome associated with other recurrent trisomies (2, 5, 7, 8, or 12) or the common recurrent secondary structural rearrangements (deletions of 1p36, 9p12, 17p13, and 16q, and gain of 1q), although numbers were small. These data demonstrate the continued value of cytogenetics as a genome-wide screen in ESFT and illustrates the potential importance of secondary chromosome changes for stratification of patients for risk. Specifically, karyotype complexity appears to be a powerful predictor of prognosis, and the presence of trisomy 20 may be a marker of a more aggressive subset of this group.","['Roberts, Paul', 'Burchill, Susan A', 'Brownhill, Samantha', 'Cullinane, Catherine J', 'Johnston, Colin', 'Griffiths, Mike J', 'McMullan, Dom J', 'Bown, Nick P', 'Morris, Stephen P', 'Lewis, Ian J']","['Roberts P', 'Burchill SA', 'Brownhill S', 'Cullinane CJ', 'Johnston C', 'Griffiths MJ', 'McMullan DJ', 'Bown NP', 'Morris SP', 'Lewis IJ']","[""Department of Cytogenetics, St James's University Hospital, Beckett Street, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK. paul.roberts@leedsth.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Karyotyping', '*Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'United Kingdom']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20523 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008 Mar;47(3):207-20. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20523.,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-five papers published between 1987 and 2006 were reviewed. These reveal that (1) chemotherapy always causes some height reduction during treatment regardless of whether additional CRT is given; (2) catch-up growth occurs immediately after cessation of treatment; (3) intensive chemotherapy alone significantly decreases height in the long-term but to a lesser extent than with additional CRT; (4) young children develop more severe height loss; (5) girls are reported to have greater height deficits but confounding factors have not been adequately considered; (6) late growth hormone (GH) deficiency has been detected in many children, mostly in those who had CRT; (7) GH replacement therapy seems to be effective.

Preliminary studies have shown that antioxidant status may affect chemotherapy tolerance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Other supplements, including TRAUMEEL S, glutamine, vitamin E, Immunocal, colostrum, and probiotics, may help to reduce gastrointestinal toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation. However, more definitive evidence is needed. Most dietary supplements have not been tested adequately to determine their safety and efficacy, with even less understood about their potential interactions with conventional chemotherapy and radiation. With the greater use of dietary supplements by patients with cancer, increasing scientific attention is being paid to the investigation of these therapies. But research on dietary supplements is complex and usually more difficult than that on conventional medications.

In many children with cancer, biomarkers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase and carboxy-(or N terminal) propeptide of type 1 procollagen) were observed to be suppressed, while bone resorption was elevated as measured by serum cross-linked (or C-terminal) telopeptide of type 1 collagen. Insulin-like growth factor 1, which stimulates bone formation, may be suppressed indirectly indicating a growth hormone insufficiency. Leptin may also play a role in bone remodeling as hyperleptinemia has been observed in association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Evaluation of bone status using such biomarkers is complicated by the lack of universally accepted reference values and the variation by age, gender, or pubertal status. Etiologic factors contributing to the observed skeletal morbidities include disease process, chemotherapy (drugs such as glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and radiotherapy. Other factors common to children with cancer, such as chronic inflammation, dietary changes and physical inactivity, must also be taken into account.

A simple energy balance paradigm has been helpful in understanding the etiology of underweight and overweight in chronic disease, including malignant disease, particularly when measurements of total energy expenditure have been made using the doubly labeled water method. Measurements of energy intake are usually insufficiently accurate and precise to be informative, and measurements of energy expended at rest alone provide an incomplete and potentially misleading assessment of energy expenditure and the causes of energy imbalance. In some diseases, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the natural history and etiology of energy imbalance are now particularly well understood. Recent improvements in our understanding of etiology should lead to improved strategies for the prevention and treatment of underweight and overweight in chronic disease. In some diseases, cachectic processes drive the development of underweight: these are partly independent of energy balance, and strategies for prevention and treatment may require approaches aimed at modifying the cachectic process rather than attempting to modify energy balance directly.","['Reilly, John J']",['Reilly JJ'],"['Division of Developmental Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, UK. jjr2y@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease', '*Energy Intake', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Thinness']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/01/08 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21412 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Feb;50(2 Suppl):452-5; discussion 468. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21412.,20,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No previous study using clinical and laboratory data has explored whether thyroid disease and especially autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) risk. In this case-control study, we investigated the association of ATD with MDS. METHODS: Our study included 101 cases with incident primary MDS confirmed by histology and cytogenetics, and 101 controls matched on gender and age, admitted for non-neoplastic and non-infectious diseases. All subjects were submitted to clinical, ultrasound thyroid evaluation and serum free T3, free T4, TSH, thyroglobulin, and thyroperoxidase antibodies determination. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index, there was statistically significant evidence that ATD is associated with increased risk of MDS (OR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.29-5.16). Interestingly, ATD starting from the remote past (more than 10 years from MDS onset) was positively associated with MDS risk (OR = 5.73. 95% CI 2.03-16.16). Mean serum levels of fT3, fT4, and thyroid antibodies were significantly higher in MDS patients and mean TSH serum levels were significantly lower in MDS patients than in controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Biological plausibility and empirical evidence highlights the importance of ATD in MDS etiopathogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore underlying mechanisms associating thyroid autoimmunity with leukemogenesis.","['Dalamaga, Maria', 'Lekka, Antigoni', 'Karmaniolas, Konstantinos', 'Stathopoulou, Eleni', 'Dionyssiou-Asteriou, Amalia']","['Dalamaga M', 'Lekka A', 'Karmaniolas K', 'Stathopoulou E', 'Dionyssiou-Asteriou A']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical School, University of Athens, ""Attikon"" General University Hospital, 19, 28th October Street, Agia Paraskevi, Athens 15341, Greece. madalamaga@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071206,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmunity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Thyroid Gland/physiopathology', 'Thyroiditis, Autoimmune/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-007-9096-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2008 May;19(4):371-8. doi: 10.1007/s10552-007-9096-3.

Exploring incidence patterns of leukemia subtypes by sex and race/ethnic group may generate new etiologic hypotheses and identify high-risk groups for further study. METHODS: Data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries for 1997-2002 were used to assess patterns of leukemia incidence by subtype, sex, age, race and ethnicity. RESULTS: A total of 144,559 leukemia cases were identified, including 66,067 (46%) acute and 71,860 (50%) chronic leukemias. The highest rates of acute myeloid leukemia with and without maturation were observed in Asian-Pacific Islanders (API). Hispanics had a higher incidence of acute lymphocytic leukemia, particularly in childhood, and promyelocytic leukemia than did non-Hispanics. African-Americans had the highest rates of HTLV-1 positive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. A sharp increase in the incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia was observed for both APIs and Hispanics, 85 years and older. CONCLUSION: Known risk factors are unlikely to explain the observed disparities in leukemia incidence. Further studies of differences in environmental and genetic risk factors in these populations by specific leukemia subtype may provide clues to the etiologies of these malignancies.","['Yamamoto, Jennifer F', 'Goodman, Marc T']","['Yamamoto JF', 'Goodman MT']","['Epidemiology Program, Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, University of Hawaii, 1236 Lauhala Street, Honolulu, HI 96813, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20071207,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['African Americans/ethnology', 'Age Factors', 'Asian Americans/ethnology', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/ethnology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/classification/*ethnology/etiology', 'Male', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-007-9097-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2008 May;19(4):379-90. doi: 10.1007/s10552-007-9097-2.

Here, we report the safety and efficacy of a rituximab-containing regimen in a CLL patient with steroid- and IVIg-refractory AIHA. CASE REPORT: A 57-year- old man affected by CLL, presented with fatigue, dyspnoea, tachycardia and jaundice. His physical examination revealed overt jaundice, hepato- and splenomegaly, and enlargement of lymph nodes in all superficial sites. The blood chemistry showed severe anemia (Hb value 3.9 g/dL), high white blood cell count (89 x 10(9)/L), altered hemolysis markers and direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was positive for both complement and IgG. The patient failed to respond to both a 4-day course of high-dose dexamethasone IV (40 mg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (1 g/kg/day x 2 days). Thus, a schedule containing rituximab (375 mg/m(2) day +1), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2) day +2) and prednisone (60 mg/m(2) from day +1 to day +7) (R-CP) were administered. Four cycles, repeated every 4 weeks, were administered. After 4 days from the infusion of this schedule, the patient showed a marked reduction of the lymphocytosis, and the hemoglobin level started to increase. No rituximab-related side effects were recorded. At the end of treatment DAT became negative and patient achieved a nodular Partial Remission (nPR). CONCLUSION: Our data showed the safety and efficacy of a rituximab-containing regimen in a life-threatening CLL-related AIHA, refractory to steroid and IVIg therapy. This schedule has allowed the patient to obtain a prompt and dramatic rise in hemoglobin level and a response to both AIHA and CLL.","['Gentile, Massimo', 'Lucia, Eugenio', 'Iorio, Caterina', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Mazzone, Carla', 'Morelli, Rosellina', 'Bisconte, Maria Grazia', 'Gentile, Carlo', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Gentile M', 'Lucia E', 'Iorio C', 'Vigna E', 'Mazzone C', 'Morelli R', 'Bisconte MG', 'Gentile C', 'Morabito F']","['Hematology Unit, Dipartimento di Medicina Interna, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza, Via Migliori, 87100, Cosenza, Italy. massim.gentile@tiscali.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071207,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0651-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;62(4):741-3. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0651-0.

We evaluated UM B-CLL patients with low/intermediate Rai risk to determine the relationship between IGHV, IGH diversity (IGHD), and IGH joining (IGHJ) gene usage and time to treatment (TTT). Irrespective of IGHV usage, UM patients whose B-CLL cells expressed the IGHD3-3 gene had a significantly shorter TTT than other UM B-CLL patients, and specifically, use of the IGHD3-3 gene in reading frame 2 (RF2) predicted shorter TTT.

Mitochondrial depolarization induced by treatment of cardiomyocytes with H(2)O(2) is prevented by activation of Akt with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This protective effect is observed even when cardiomyocytes treated with LIF are permeabilized and mitochondrial depolarization is elicited by elevating Ca(2+). Cell fractionation studies demonstrate that LIF treatment increases both total and phosphorylated Akt in the mitochondrial fraction. Furthermore, the association of Akt with HK-II is increased by LIF. HK-II contains consensus sequences for phosphorylation by Akt and LIF treatment induces PI3K- and Akt-dependent HK-II phosphorylation. Addition of recombinant kinase-active Akt to isolated adult mouse heart mitochondria stimulates phosphorylation of HK-II and concomitantly inhibits the ability of Ca(2+) to induce cytochrome c release. This protection is prevented when HK-II is dissociated from mitochondria by incubation with glucose 6-phosphate or HK-II-dissociating peptide. Finally LIF increases HK-II association with mitochondria and dissociation of HK-II from mitochondria attenuates the protective effect of LIF on H(2)O(2)-induced mitochondrial depolarization in cardiomyocytes.

GO (6 mg/m2) and standard-dose cytarabine (100 mg/m2) is evaluated for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in elderly patients in the SAL phase II trial. Preliminary results of the MRC AML15 trial support the application of GO 3 mg/m2 with standard- and high-dose cytarabine and anthracyclines for the treatment of de novo AML. Within this trial the addition of GO seems especially of value for favorable and intermediate cytogenetic risk groups. The combination of GO (3 mg/m2) and high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2) is safe and more effective for the treatment of refractory AML than previous combinations from the AMLSG study group. First results prove the possibility of allogeneic stem cell transplantation after GO therapy.

Neutrophil granules, secretory vesicles (SV), and plasma membrane vesicles were isolated by subcellular fractionation, followed by free-flow electrophoresis, and examined by ELISA and immunoblot. TRAIL was found in all membrane-bound fractions with the highest amounts in the fractions enriched in azurophilic granule (AG) and SV. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that TRAIL colocalized independently with myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin (LF), and albumin, respective markers of AG, specific granules, and SV. Furthermore, immunotransmission electron microscopy demonstrated that TRAIL colocalized intracellularly with MPO and albumin. We examined TRAIL expression in PLB-985 cells induced with dimethylformamide and in CD34-positive stem cells treated with G-CSF. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that TRAIL was expressed in each stage of development, whereas MPO and LF were only expressed at distinct times during differentiation. Collectively, these findings suggest that TRAIL is expressed throughout neutrophil development, resulting in a broad distribution among different granule subtypes.","['Simons, Mark P', 'Leidal, Kevin G', 'Nauseef, William M', 'Griffith, Thomas S']","['Simons MP', 'Leidal KG', 'Nauseef WM', 'Griffith TS']","['Department of Urology, University of Iowa, 375 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242-1089, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071206,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*physiology', 'Reference Values', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0707452 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0707452 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Mar;83(3):621-9. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0707452.

In this study we find that this regulatory function is conserved in the lower eukaryotes, suggesting that translin and TRAX have important functions which provide a selective advantage to both unicellular and multi-cellular eukaryotes, indicating that this function may not be tissue-specific in nature. However, to date, the biological importance of translin and TRAX remains unclear. Here we systematically investigate proposals that suggest translin and TRAX play roles in controlling mitotic cell proliferation, DNA damage responses, genome stability, meiotic/mitotic recombination and stability of GT-rich repeat sequences. We find no evidence for translin and/or TRAX primary function in these pathways, indicating that the conserved biochemical function of translin is not implicated in primary pathways for regulating genome stability and/or segregation.","['Jaendling, Alessa', 'Ramayah, Soshila', 'Pryce, David W', 'McFarlane, Ramsay J']","['Jaendling A', 'Ramayah S', 'Pryce DW', 'McFarlane RJ']","['North West Cancer Research Fund Institute, University of Wales Bangor, Bangor, Gwynedd, LL57 2UW, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071107,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Salts)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)', '0 (TRAX protein, S pombe)', '0 (tsn1 protein, S pombe)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'N1Q45E87DT (Thiabendazole)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA, Fungal/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Meiosis/drug effects', 'Microsatellite Instability/drug effects', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Salts/pharmacology', 'Schizosaccharomyces/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/*metabolism', '*Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thiabendazole/pharmacology']",2007/12/08 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2007/12/08 09:00'],"['2007/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(07)00259-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Feb;1783(2):203-13. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.10.014.

Successful implantation requires a receptive endometrium, a normal and functional embryo at the blastocyst stage and a synchronized dialogue between maternal and embryonic tissues. In addition to the main role of sex steroids, the complexity of embryo implantation and placentation is exemplified by the number of cytokines and growth factors with demonstrated roles in these processes. Disturbances of the normal expression and action of these cytokines result in absolute or partial failure of implantation and abnormal placental formation in mice and humans. Members of the gp130 cytokine family, interleukin (IL)-11 and leukaemia inhibitory factor, the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, colony-stimulating factors, and the IL-1 and IL-15 systems are all crucial for successful implantation. In addition, chemokines are important both in recruiting specific cohorts of leukocytes to the implantation site, and in trophoblast trafficking and differentiation.

The proliferative capacity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to allogeneic stimulation was measured by 5,6-carboxy-succinimidyl-diacetate-fluorescein-ester staining. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using surface CD4, CD8, CD25, CD103 and intracellular perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B, caspase-3 and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) markers. The in vivo immunosuppressive capacity was tested in a murine skin graft model. Addition of CPEC at a concentration of 20 nM strongly decreased the expansion and cytotoxicity of alloreactive T cells. Specific restimulation in the absence of CPEC showed that the cells became anergic. The drug induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of alloreactive T lymphocytes. Finally, CPEC increased the percentage of CD25(high) FoxP3+ CD4+ and CD103+ CD8+ T cells, and potentiated the effect of rapamycin in increasing the numbers of alloreactive regulatory T cells. Treatment with CPEC of CBA/CA mice transplanted with B10/Br skin grafts significantly prolonged graft survival.

To elucidate the immunophenotype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and characterize the correlation among morphological, immunological, cytogenetic, and clinical features, we studied the bone marrow immunophenotypes of 180 AML patients in China by flow cytometry. The results showed that CD34, CD2, CD14, CD19, CD56, and HLA-DR were correlated with FAB subtypes. Amongst the 180 patients enrolled in this study, 122 cases were also subjected to karyotype analysis by G-banding technology and abnormal karyotypes were detected in 69 out of 122 patients. Correlation assay showed that t(8;21) was only present in 16 AML-M2 patients, and strongly associated with the individual or combinational expressions of CD15/CD19/CD34/CD56. As to M3, although lymphoid lineage antigens were observed in a considerable number of patients, they were never detected in t(15;17) positive patients. The expressions of CD22, CD56, and TdT showed significant correlation with the overall presence of abnormal karyotype. Additionally, the expressions of CD4, CD7, CD14, CD56, and TdT were positively correlated with clinical features such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and patient's age. In conclusion, immunophenotype analysis was useful for AML diagnosis and classification. At the same time, the data also suggested that the karyotype abnormalities and clinical features were tightly linked with abnormal antigen expression characteristics in AML patients. As one of the largest correlative study performed in China, the results highlighted the importance of a morphological, immunological, and cytogenetic classification of AML that might constitute a working basis for future studies aimed at a better definition of clinicopathological features and optimal treatment strategy for these leukemias.","['Zheng, Jine', 'Wang, Xingbing', 'Hu, Yu', 'Yang, Jing', 'Liu, Jun', 'He, Yanli', 'Gong, Qing', 'Yao, Junxia', 'Li, Xiaoqing', 'Du, Wen', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Zheng J', 'Wang X', 'Hu Y', 'Yang J', 'Liu J', 'He Y', 'Gong Q', 'Yao J', 'Li X', 'Du W', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Trisomy 12 was associated with a higher frequency of DNA aneuploidy, stronger expression of CD19, CD20, CD22, CD24, CD27, CD79b, CD38, and sIg and lower reactivity for CD43 with respect to cytogenetically nonaltered cases. In turn, cases with del(13q) displayed greater reactivity for CD20, FMC7, CD27, CD22, CD5, and bcl2, while del(11q) was associated with brighter expression of CD38, FMC7, CD25, and sIg. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the immunophenotype of B-CLL cases with cytogenetic abnormalities allowed the identification of three different groups of patients with increasing frequencies of trisomy 12, del(11q), and del(13q).

In this study, the expression of a variety of antigens expressed in normal and postchemotherapy bone marrow (BM) was analyzed to provide a frame of reference for the identification of myeloid LAIPs. METHODS: Multiparameter four- and six-color flow cytometry was used to define antigen combinations totally absent or present at very minimal levels in marrow cells of normal individuals (n = 20) and patients receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 20). Immature (blast) cells were gated according to CD45/SSC properties. Fifty-three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples were studied in six-color combinations. RESULTS: In six-color flow cytometry, 47 phenotypes were totally absent from blast gate in all normal samples. Forty-one other phenotypes were identified in less than 0.05% of blast cells. There was no difference between normal and postchemotherapy BMs. The four-color panel allowed to identify only 30 phenotypes present at a frequency <0.05%. Using the six-color panel, 58% of the absent or infrequent phenotypes in normal BM were found in at least one of 53 AML samples. All AML cases exhibited at least one LAIP. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the ability to distinguish leukemic from healthy cells is considerably increased by a six-color approach. Furthermore, these absent or infrequent phenotypes in normal BM are identified in AML and can be utilized for minimal residual disease study.","['Olaru, D', 'Campos, L', 'Flandrin, P', 'Nadal, N', 'Duval, A', 'Chautard, S', 'Guyotat, D']","['Olaru D', 'Campos L', 'Flandrin P', 'Nadal N', 'Duval A', 'Chautard S', 'Guyotat D']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Hopital Nord, CHU de Saint-Etienne, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We reported previously that purging by positive selection of CD34+ and CD133+ cells resulted in a 3-4 log tumor cell reduction (TCR) in CD34- and/or CD133- AML, but has been shown to be potentially applicable in only about 50% of cases. Similar to CD34 and CD133, CD90 marks the hematopoietic CD34 positive stem cells capable of full hematopoietic recovery after myeloablative chemotherapy, and therefore, in the present study, we explored whether a similar purging approach is possible using CD90. METHODS: CD90 expression was established by flowcytometry in diagnosis AML on the clonogenic AML CD34+ blast population by flow cytometry. Positivity was defined as >3% CD90 (CD34+) expression on blasts. For the calculation of the efficacy of TCR by positive selection, AML blasts were recognized by either prelabeling diagnosis blasts with CD45-FITC in spiking model experiments or using expression of leukemia associated marker combinations both in spiking experiments and in real transplants. RESULTS: In 119 patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome, we found coexpression of CD34 and CD90 (>3%) in 42 cases (35%). In AML patients 60 years or younger, representing the patients who are eligible for transplantation, only 23% (16/69) of the patients showed CD90 expression. Positive selection for CD90 in transplants containing CD90 negative AML resulted in a 2.8-4 log TCR in the models used. CONCLUSIONS: Purging by positive selection using CD90 can potentially be applied effectively in the majority of AML patients 60 years or younger.","['Feller, Nicole', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Westra, Guus', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['Feller N', 'Kelder A', 'Westra G', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We developed a biochip for the analysis of 18 mutations in 10 genes of metabolizing system: CYP1A1, CYP2D6, GSTT1, GSTM1, MTHFR, MTRR, NQO1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and NAT2. Using allele-specific hybridization on the biochip 76 T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, 83 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients, and 177 healthy donors were tested. Polymorphic CYP1A1 alleles were more frequent in B-CLL patients relative to normal controls, for example, a combination of polymorphic variants 4887C > A, 4889A > G, and 6235T > C (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.0-3.1). The GSTM1 null genotype was more frequent in NHL patients relative to controls (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.1-3.1). The combination of unfavorable polymorphic CYP1A1 variants and GSTM1 null genotype was found more frequently in B-CLL patients relative to controls (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.3-4.9). In addition, male B-CLL patients demonstrated a significantly increased occurrence of heterozygous and homozygous allele *2 of CYP2C9 gene (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.1-5.2) as well as a combination of alleles *2 and *3 of the gene (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.1-3.9). Thus, our findings show the association between polymorphic alleles of CYP1A1, GSTM1, and CYP2C9 genes and the risk to develop NHL or B-CLL.

With these regimens, the complete response (CR) rates are approximately 75% and long-term disease-free survival (DFS) rates are about 20-35%. For patients with high-risk ALL, DFS rates are only 20% or less. Hyper-CVAD regimen is effective in ALL and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) with increased CR rates and DFS rates. Between June 2002 and October 2006, 53 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed adult ALL were treated with Hyper-CVAD regimen for six to eight cycles. The alternating courses were given every 3-4 weeks or earlier if count recovery occurred. CR rates of 73.6% were achieved in 39 patients, the estimated 2-year survival rate was 82.9% and the estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 87.3%. Side effects were as expected, mostly attributed to myelosuppression. Analysis of prognostic factors suggested that some previously well-established poor prognostic factors such as the degree of leukocytosis and central nervous system (CNS) or testicular involvement were less important with this dose-intensive regimen. However, patients with mediastinal disease had lower CR rates (P<0.05), with the presence of hepatomegaly and t(9;22) abnormalities had poor survival (P<0.05).

CD200 is a membrane glycoprotein that imparts an immunoregulatory signal through CD200R, leading to the suppression of T-cell-mediated immune responses. We investigated the expression of CD200 in cancer using publicly available gene expression data. CD200 gene expression in normal or malignant human tissues or cell lines was obtained from the Oncomine Cancer Microarray database, Amazonia database and the ITTACA database. We found significant overexpression of CD200 in renal carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, testicular cancer, malignant mesothelioma, colon carcinoma, MGUS/smoldering myeloma, and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to their normal cells or their tissue counterparts. Moreover, we show that CD200 expression is associated with tumor progression in various cancers. Taken together, these data suggest that CD200 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic factor for a large array of malignancies.","['Moreaux, Jerome', 'Veyrune, Jean Luc', 'Reme, Thierry', 'De Vos, John', 'Klein, Bernard']","['Moreaux J', 'Veyrune JL', 'Reme T', 'De Vos J', 'Klein B']","['CHU Montpellier, Hopital St Eloi, Institut de Recherches en Biotherapie, Av Augustin Fliche, 34285 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071204,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(07)02511-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.11.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Feb 1;366(1):117-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.11.103.

Since defects in the elimination of apoptotic cells lead to secondary necrosis and subsequent release of intracellular components, this might explain the generation of autoantibodies against intracellular antigens. Accordingly, we wanted to investigate, whether antibodies from patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) recognize self-proteins generated and released during apoptosis. Using Western blot analyses we could detect intracellular antigens with serum IgG from PBC patients but not with serum IgG from healthy donors in lysates of Jurkat T-leukemia, HepG2 hepatoma, and HT-29 colon-carcinoma cells. Interestingly, PBC serum IgG also recognized caspase substrates in cells undergoing apoptosis induced by staurosporine or TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand). In addition to intracellular antigens, serum IgG from PBC patients detected caspase-dependent antigens in the supernatants of apoptotic (secondary necrotic) cells and antigens on the surface of apoptotic Jurkat cells. Among the caspase substrates recognized by PBC serum IgG we could identify the components PDC-E2 and -E1beta of the known autoantigen PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex). Thus, caspase-mediated processing of intracellular proteins might generate de novo autoantigens that upon release contribute to the generation of autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases as PBC.","['Berg, Christoph Peter', 'Stein, Gerburg Maria', 'Keppeler, Hildegard', 'Gregor, Michael', 'Wesselborg, Sebastian', 'Lauber, Kirsten']","['Berg CP', 'Stein GM', 'Keppeler H', 'Gregor M', 'Wesselborg S', 'Lauber K']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Clinic, Eberhard-Karls-University, Otfried-Mueller-Strasse 10, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/blood/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/etiology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex/*immunology/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology']",2007/12/07 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2007/12/07 09:00'],"['2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-007-0157-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Jan;13(1):63-75. doi: 10.1007/s10495-007-0157-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
