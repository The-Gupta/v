The use of flow cytometry in the veterinary clinical laboratory has increased considerably during the past decade. The most common applications of flow cytometry in small animal oncology are measurement of DNA content in tumours and immunophenotyping of haematopoietic malignancies. DNA ploidy and S-phase rate of various tumours in dogs have been found to be independent predictor of patient outcome. In dogs with lymphomas immunophenotyping is recommended as a part of the patient work-up. Flow cytometry has shown to be a suitable method for immunophenotyping of canine lymphomas. However, it has not become a routine technique in small animal oncology yet. This report reviews the applications of flow cytometry in small animal oncology. Besides basic principles and technical aspects, the clinical relevance of DNA-analysis and immunophenotyping are discussed.","['Culmsee, Katja', 'Nolte, Ingo']","['Culmsee K', 'Nolte I']","['Clinic of Small Animals, School of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Bischofsholer Damm 15, 30173 Hannover, Germany. katja.Cculmsee@tiho-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Methods Cell Sci,Methods in cell science : an official journal of the Society for In Vitro Biology,9515839,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cats', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Dog Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/*veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Ploidies']",41,2003/06/20 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['5113149 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1024133628927 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Cell Sci. 2002;24(1-3):49-54. doi: 10.1023/a:1024133628927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was induced in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, by incubation with 30 microM etoposide for 5 hours. Changes in gene expression occurring during apoptosis in these cells were detected using the ""ATLAS cDNA Expression Array"" technique. 40 genes were identified as differentially expressed in the apoptotic cells by at least a factor of two. 30 of these genes were down-regulated during apoptosis. Many of the down-regulated genes reflected decreased proliferative activity in the cells as well as decreased activity of survival pathways. Most of the genes, which were up-regulated during apoptosis, were genes involved in pathways leading to cell death and suppression of proliferation. Based on the up-regulations observed at the mRNA level, it is speculated that etoposide-induced apoptosis in the HL-60 cells proceeds via pathways involving factors such as TNFalpha, IGFBP3, SAPK1, AP-1 and GADD153/CHOP10. Four genes, which showed changes at the mRNA level, were also analyzed by Western blotting in order to confirm the observed differences at the protein level.","['Bjorling-Poulsen, M', 'Issinger, O-G']","['Bjorling-Poulsen M', 'Issinger OG']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, 5230 Odense M, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Etoposide/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['5128059 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1024177119658 [doi]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2003 Aug;8(4):377-88. doi: 10.1023/a:1024177119658.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a paradigm where apoptosis is initiated by the effector caspase-3. Diethylmaleate (DEM)-induced apoptotic damage in Jurkat cells was blocked by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, whereas, a peptide inhibitor of caspase-3 but not caspase-9 blocked DEM-induced mitochondrial damage. Isogenic Jurkat cell lines deficient for caspase-8 or the adaptor FADD (Fas associated death domain) were not protected from DEM-induced apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation preceded that of caspase-9 and initial processing of caspase-3 was regulated independent of caspase-9 and Bcl-2. However, inhibitors of caspase-9 or caspase-6 regulated caspase-3 later in the pathway. We explored the mechanism by which caspase-3 processing is regulated in this system. DEM triggered a loss of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) expression. The phorbol ester PMA activated a MEK-dependent pathway to block caspase-3 processing and cell death. Constitutively active MEK-1 (CA-MEK) upregulated XIAP expression and exogenous XIAP inhibited DEM-induced apoptotic damage. Thus, we describe a pathway where caspase-3 functions to initiate apoptotic damage and caspase-9 and caspase-6 amplify the apoptotic cascade. Further, we show that MEK may regulate caspase-3 activation via the regulation of XIAP expression in these cells.","['Varghese, J', 'Khandre, N S', 'Sarin, A']","['Varghese J', 'Khandre NS', 'Sarin A']","['National Centre for Biological Sciences, New Bellary Road, UAS-GKVK Campus, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G81WQB56OL (diethyl maleate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Maleates/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['5128055 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1024121017841 [doi]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2003 Aug;8(4):363-70. doi: 10.1023/a:1024121017841.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of hundred and twelve patients with ALL have been analysed. The median age of the patients was 40 years (range: 15-65), the gender ratio (M/F) was 66/46, and the morphologic FAB (French-American-British) profile was L1 in 30 (26.9%) patients, L2 in 71 (63.3%) and L3 morphology in 11 (9.8%) of the patients. The LALA 87 protocol includes five phases: induction, consolidation, reinforcement, maintenance and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate and irradiation. The induction phase comprised daunorubicin 50 mg/m(2) (days 1-3), cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8), vincristine 1.5 mg/m(2) (on days 1, 8, 15 and 22) and daily oral prednisone on days 1-21. Maintenance therapy was given for 2 years and consisted of different drugs as reinforcement, daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 81 (72.3%) of the patients. The causes of induction failure were partial response in 10 (8.9%), and hypoplastic death in 12 patients (10.7%), and 9 were non-responders (8.0%). Of the 81 patients who achieved CR, 62 relapsed (76%). Among the relapsed patients, 9 developed CNS disease in spite of CNS prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy. Median follow-up for the living patients was 110 months. Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 16 months; 19 patients are still in remission with an estimated 10-year DFS (24%). Adverse prognostic factors were >50 years of age, immunologic subtype and cytogenetic profile. CONCLUSION: The results support the strategy of applying more effort and other treatment modalities in the therapy of ALL.","['Colovic, M', 'Bogdanovic, A', 'Jankovic, G', 'Kraguljac, N', 'Suvajdzic, N']","['Colovic M', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Jankovic G', 'Kraguljac N', 'Suvajdzic N']","['Institute of Haematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia. marcolov@eunet.yu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2002/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000070620 [doi]', '70620 [pii]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2003 Jun;49(3):138-45. doi: 10.1159/000070620.,"['Copyright 2003 S.

In this study, we identified GTP-14564 as a specific kinase inhibitor for ITD-FLT3 and investigated the molecular basis of its specificity. GTP-14564 inhibited the growth of interleukin-3-independent Ba/F3 expressing ITD-FLT3 at 1 microM, whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required to inhibit FLT3 ligand-dependent growth of Ba/F3 expressing wild type FLT3 (wt-FLT3). However, this inhibitor suppressed the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally, suggesting that the signaling pathways for proliferation differ between wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Analysis of downstream targets of FLT3 using GTP-14564 revealed STAT5 activation to be essential for growth signaling of ITD-FLT3. In contrast, wt-FLT3 appeared to mainly use the MAPK pathway rather than the STAT5 pathway to transmit a proliferative signal. Further analysis demonstrated that the first two tyrosines in an ITD were critical for STAT5 activation and growth induction but that all of the tyrosines in the juxtamembrane region were dispensable in terms of the proliferation signals of wt-FLT3. These results indicate that an ITD mutation in FLT3 elicits an aberrant STAT5 activation that results in increased sensitivity to GTP-14564. Thus, FLT3-targeted inhibition is an attractive approach, with the potential for selective cytotoxicity, to the treatment of ITD-FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia.","['Murata, Ken', 'Kumagai, Hidetoshi', 'Kawashima, Toshiyuki', 'Tamitsu, Kaori', 'Irie, Mariko', 'Nakajima, Hideaki', 'Suzu, Shinya', 'Shibuya, Masabumi', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Asano, Shigetaka', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Murata K', 'Kumagai H', 'Kawashima T', 'Tamitsu K', 'Irie M', 'Nakajima H', 'Suzu S', 'Shibuya M', 'Kamihira S', 'Nosaka T', 'Asano S', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Hematopoietic Factors, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GTP 14564)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M210405200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)83846-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Aug 29;278(35):32892-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M210405200.

Treatment of patients with alkylating chemotherapeutic agents has been established to increase their risk for acute myelogenous leukemia. The formation of DNA adducts and induction of mutations are likely to play a role in the etiology of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. To evaluate this issue for TMZ, we have measured the formation of DNA adducts and induction of lacI mutations in Big Blue Rat-2 cells treated with TMZ. Treatment of Big Blue Rat-2 cells with either 0, 0.5, or 1 mM TMZ resulted in lacI mutant frequencies of 9.1 +/- 2.9 x 10(-5), 48.9 +/- 12 x 10(-5), and 89.7 +/- 40.3 x 10(-5), respectively. Comparison of the mutant frequencies demonstrated that 0.5 and 1 mM TMZ treatments increased the mutant frequencies by 5.3- and 9.8-fold and that this increase was significant (P < 0.001). Sequence analysis of the lacI mutants from the TMZ treatment group demonstrated that they were GC-->AT transitions at non-CpG sites, which is significantly different from the mutation spectrum observed in the control treatment group. Treatment of Big Blue Rat-2 cells with various concentrations of TMZ produced a linear increase in the levels of N7-methylguanine and O(6)-methylguanine. The lacI mutation spectrum induced by TMZ treatment is consistent with these mutations being produced by O(6)-MeG. This study establishes TMZ has significant mutagenic potential and suggests that careful consideration in the use of TMZ for the treatment of low-grade adult and pediatric brain tumors should be given.","['Bodell, William J', 'Gaikwad, Nilesh W', 'Miller, Douglas', 'Berger, Mitchel S']","['Bodell WJ', 'Gaikwad NW', 'Miller D', 'Berger MS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Therapeutics, Brain Tumor Research Center of the Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143-0555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Alkylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'DNA Adducts/*biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency/drug effects/genetics', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Temozolomide', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2004/02/06 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2003 Jun;12(6):545-51.,,,"['CA80685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES09500/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological studies have established a strong association between obstetric exposure to diagnostic radiation and an increase in the incidence of childhood leukaemia and between low dose gamma irradiation during the early fetal period and mental retardation in children. It has been suggested that insufficient oxygen supply to the developing brain due to radiation induced damage to fetal haemopoietic tissue has a role in inducing the severe mental retardation observed in the Japanese children exposed to atom bomb radiation in utero. Experimental studies have shown that X- and gamma irradiation of pregnant mice with <1 Gy during the late organogenesis or fetal period caused chromosome damage and significant depletion in the fetal haemopoietic progenitor cells and led to haematological disorders in the adults.

Examples of such proteins include the checkpoint kinase ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) as well as replication protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA binding protein required in DNA replication and repair. Here, we used a microscopy-based approach to investigate whether the damage-induced translocation of RPA is an active process regulated by ATR. Our data show that in undamaged cells, ATR and RPA are uniformly distributed in the nucleus or localized to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. In cells treated with ionizing radiation, both ATR and RPA translocate to punctate, abundant nuclear foci where they continue to colocalize. Surprisingly, an ATR mutant that lacks kinase activity fails to relocalize in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, this kinase-inactive mutant blocks the translocation of RPA in a cell cycle-dependent manner. These observations demonstrate that the kinase activity of ATR is essential for the irradiation-induced release of ATR and RPA from PML bodies and translocation of ATR and RPA to potential sites of DNA damage.","['Barr, Sharon M', 'Leung, Cindy G', 'Chang, Elbert E', 'Cimprich, Karlene A']","['Barr SM', 'Leung CG', 'Chang EE', 'Cimprich KA']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Stanford University, California 94305-5174, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RPA1 protein, human)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*physiology/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Replication Protein A']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(03)00376-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00376-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2003 Jun 17;13(12):1047-51. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00376-2.,,,"['CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95357/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62193/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a haemopoietic neoplasm involving myeloid progenitors similar to MPD. In the present study, we measured the levels of peripheral blood (pb) and bone marrow (bm) CFU in patients with different categories of SM, and compared them with those obtained in MPD patients and healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Numbers of CFU (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-GEMM) were measured in a colony assay in 25 patients with SM [indolent SM (ISM), n = 15; smouldering SM (SSM), n = 3; SM with an associated haematologic clonal non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), n = 5; aggressive SM (ASM), n = 1; mast cell leukaemia (MCL), n = 1] and 37 with MPD [chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), n = 10; polycythemia vera (PV), n = 8; essential thrombocytosis (ET), n = 9; idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), n = 10]. RESULTS: In the patients with MPD, elevated numbers of pb CFU were detected in all groups when compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). In most of the patients with ISM, circulating CFU levels (CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM) were within the normal range. In SSM, pb CFU-GM levels were normal in two patients, and elevated in a third patient. In the ""SM-AHNMD-group"", CFU levels were found to reflect the nature of the AHNMD: in SM with concomitant acute myeloid leukaemia (SM-AML, n = 2), the levels of CFU were low or undetectable, whereas in SM with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (SM-CMML, n = 2), elevated numbers of pb CFU-GM were found. CONCLUSION: The numbers of CFU are normal in patients with ISM, but elevated in some patients with SSM and SM-CMML. An elevated CFU level in SM should raise the suspicion of an associated MPD (CMML) or smouldering SM, a novel SM-subtype that shares several features with MPD and sometimes progresses to an overt SM-MPD.","['Jordan, J-H', 'Jager, E', 'Sperr, W R', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Fodinger, M', 'Fritsche-Polanz, R', 'Ohler, L', 'Geissler, K', 'Valent, P']","['Jordan JH', 'Jager E', 'Sperr WR', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Fodinger M', 'Fritsche-Polanz R', 'Ohler L', 'Geissler K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/*blood/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*diagnosis', 'Stem Cells/pathology']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['1172 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2362.2003.01172.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2003 Jul;33(7):611-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2362.2003.01172.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it has been demonstrated that oncostatin M has biological activities on many types of cells, including hepatocytes, dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the roles of oncostatin M in the murine peripheral nervous system remain unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of specific beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor in the dorsal root ganglia of adult mice. In the adult dorsal root ganglia, beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor was exclusively expressed in small-sized neurons. Approximately 13% of total dorsal root ganglia neurons in mice contained beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor. The double-immunofluorescence method revealed that approximately 28% of beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor-positive neurons contained TrkA immunoreactivity, 63% expressed Ret immunoreactivity and 58% bound isolectin B4. No neuropeptides, including substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, were contained in the neurons. In addition, all beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor-positive neurons expressed both vanilloid receptor 1 and P2X3 purinergic receptor. These neurons projected to the inner portion of lamina II in the dorsal horn of spinal cord and the dermis of skin. Seven days after sciatic nerve axotomy, the expression of beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor was down-regulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of the injured side. Our study demonstrated that beta-subunit of oncostatin M receptor was expressed in both cell bodies and processes of nonpeptidergic nociceptive neurons in adult mice, suggesting that oncostatin M may affect the nociceptive function of the neurons through the modulation of vanilloid receptor 1 and P2X3 expression.","['Tamura, Shinobu', 'Morikawa, Yoshihiro', 'Miyajima, Atsushi', 'Senba, Emiko']","['Tamura S', 'Morikawa Y', 'Miyajima A', 'Senba E']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Wakay ama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama, Japan, 641-8509.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Contactins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (P2rx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X3)', '0 (isolectin B4-binding glycoprotein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axotomy/methods', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Contactins', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/injuries/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', '*Glycoproteins', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons, Afferent/classification/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'RNA Probes/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Receptor, trkA', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Drug/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X3', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/cytology/metabolism']",,2003/06/20 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/06/20 05:00'],"['2003/06/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['2681 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02681.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 2003 Jun;17(11):2287-98. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02681.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This completes a path for current flow through the body. These currents provide an additional coupling mechanism between the human body and low-frequency external fields to that due to direct induction effects. Recent research indicates that childhood exposure to residential contact currents may play a role in explaining any possible association between residential magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. To verify this hypothesis, laboratory experiments with rodents are planned. Thus, it is important to understand the relationship between fields induced in rodents and humans. Results from numerical computations are reported here. They are based on high-resolution anatomically based inhomogeneous models of adult and child male humans and male and female rats and mice, for a variety of 60-Hz contact current scenarios. It is hoped that this work will aid in the design of experiments involving rodents and in the interpretation of results as applied to humans. It is found that for geometrically similar models, the induced electric-field scales in an anticipated inverse-square manner with the geometric scaling factor. For dissimilar models, scaling can provide a crude estimate for translating induced field results between species.

After subtraction of the artificial, random or cross-hybridization signals, data about 5315 genes have been effectively analysed in all samples. The assay revealed >/=4-fold difference in the average expression of 263 genes in all CML samples when compared to normal counterparts, with 148 genes being upregulated and 115 being downregulated. Differentially expressed genes include those associated with BCR/ABL-induced abnormalities in signal transduction, gene transactivation, cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion, DNA repair, differentiation, metabolism and malignant progression. Interestingly, CML-blast crisis cells in peripheral blood differ from those from bone marrow, indicating major changes in gene expression profiles upon entering into the bloodstream.

Examining primary cells of children with untreated acute leukemia, TRAIL induced apoptosis in 50% of cells, but to our surprise attenuated spontaneous apoptosis in the remaining samples or, most importantly, even mediated proliferation. We therefore examined tumor cell lines of leukemic and nonleukemic origin with apoptosis resistance towards TRAIL because of absent Caspase-8 or dysfunctional FADD. In all cell lines tested, TRAIL treatment increased cell numbers in average to 163% within 4 days and accelerated doubling time from 24 to 19 h. TRAIL-mediated proliferation was completely abrogated by blockade of NF-kappaB activation using proteasome inhibitors or in RIP-negative, IKKgamma-negative cells or in cells overexpressing dominant-negative IkappaBalpha. Our data describe the biological significance of TRAIL-mediated activation of NF-kappaB in cancer cells resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis: TRAIL leads to an increase in tumor cell count by a prosurvival and possibly mitogenic function. Given the promising therapeutic potential of TRAIL as a novel anticancer drug, TRAIL-mediated survival or proliferation of target cells may restrict its use to apoptosis-sensitive tumors.","['Ehrhardt, Harald', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Hiscott, John', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Jeremias, Irmela']","['Ehrhardt H', 'Fulda S', 'Schmid I', 'Hiscott J', 'Debatin KM', 'Jeremias I']","['Dr von Haunersches Kinderspital, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Lindwurmstr 4, Munich 80337, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/deficiency/physiology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,2003/06/19 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/19 05:00'],"['2003/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206520 [doi]', '1206520 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jun 19;22(25):3842-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206520.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the novel conditioning regimen of 550 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) alone for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation would have reduced organ toxicity and thus permit safer transplantation of primary amyloidosis patients, even those with poor risk disease. The comprehensive regimen included pretransplantation chemotherapy, single-dose TBI alone (550 cGy at 30 cGy/min) conditioning, and post-transplantation interferon-alpha maintenance. Thirteen patients were enrolled in this feasibility study. Patients with multiorgan involvement were included; 10 patients had poor or intermediate risk disease. Cardiac toxicity was significant. Treatment-related mortality through 100 days post-transplantation was 15% and was caused by cardiac mortality. One patient died from arrhythmia after receiving TBI; 2 patients had grade IV cardiac toxicity (with subsequent complete recovery). One patient died 1 month after mobilization from progressive cardiomyopathy and never received conditioning. However, noncardiac organ toxicity was mild. No patient required parenteral nutrition support; no patient developed mucositis; and no patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding following transplantation. The complete hematologic remission rate was 45%, with pretransplantation chemotherapy being the most active part of the regimen. Survival estimates from enrollment to 1 and 2 years post-transplantation were 66% and 47%, respectively. Causes of death were disease progression (6), myelodysplasia (1), arrhythmia following TBI (1), and congestive heart failure after mobilization (1). In this cohort of primary amyloidosis patients, the transplantation regimen of 550 cGy TBI was feasible and associated with modest treatment-related mortality. Efficacy with TBI conditioning may be reduced compared with high-dose melphalan, but this should be explored in a future trial with a larger cohort of patients.","['Blum, William', 'Khoury, Hanna', 'Lin, H-S', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Goodnough, Lawrence T', 'Devine, Steve', 'Dipersio, John', 'Adkins, Douglas']","['Blum W', 'Khoury H', 'Lin HS', 'Vij R', 'Goodnough LT', 'Devine S', 'Dipersio J', 'Adkins D']","['Division of Oncology, Section of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

HuM195/rGel is composed of the recombinant plant toxin gelonin (rGel) chemically coupled to the anti-CD33 human chimeric antibody HuM195. The CD33 antigen is of significant interest as a target for therapy of acute myelogenous leukemia because it is present in leukemic blasts of most patients but absent in the earliest progenitor bone marrow cells. HuM195/rGel was optimally cytotoxic to acute myelogenous leukemia HL60 cells with 24 hours of exposure. We developed an in vivo purging model by mixing mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells with HL60 cells to simulate a remission in bone marrow. Cells were treated with 10 nmol/L of HuM195/rGel either with or without exposure to freeze/thaw procedure, which has been reported to act synergistically with HuM195/rGel to produce cytotoxic effect. When clonogenic cell recovery rates were determined, HuM195/rGel alone did not affect normal peripheral blood progenitor cells, whereas HuM195/rGel plus freeze/thaw provided 2 logs of tumor cell elimination in our purging model. We also observed similar results under conditions used in the transplantation setting. We concluded that for acute myelogenous leukemia blasts expressing CD33, HuM195/rGel could be useful as a purging reagent for autologous transplantation.","['Duzkale, Hatice', 'Pagliaro, Lance C', 'Rosenblum, Michael G', 'Varan, Ali', 'Liu, Baoshun', 'Reuben, James', 'Wierda, William G', 'Korbling, Martin', 'McMannis, John D', 'Glassman, Armand B', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Freireich, Emil J']","['Duzkale H', 'Pagliaro LC', 'Rosenblum MG', 'Varan A', 'Liu B', 'Reuben J', 'Wierda WG', 'Korbling M', 'McMannis JD', 'Glassman AB', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of Special Medical Education Programs and Adult Leukemia Research Program, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (HuM195-gelonin)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Plant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2003/06/19 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/06/19 05:00'],"['2003/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879103001290 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00129-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jun;9(6):364-72. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00129-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the antitumor activity and mechanism of action of paricalcitol in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Effects of paricalcitol on proliferation, the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis were examined in cancer cell lines. Effects on tumor growth were examined with colon cancer cell xenografts in nude mice (five in the experimental group and five in the control group). The interaction of paricalcitol with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mononuclear spleen cells and myeloid stem cells from wild-type and VDR knockout mice was examined. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Paricalcitol inhibited the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60, NB-4, and THP-1 cells at an effective dose that inhibited growth 50% (ED(50)) of 2.4-5.8 x 10(-9) M by inducing cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Paricalcitol inhibited the proliferation of NCI-H929 myeloma cells at an ED(50) of 2.0 x 10(-10) M by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Paricalcitol also inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines HT-29 (ED(50) = 1.7 x 10(-8) M) and SW837 (ED(50) = 3.2 x 10(-8) M). HT-29 colon cancer xenografts in paricalcitol-treated nude mice were smaller (1044 mm(3) and 1752 mm(3), difference = 708 mm(3), 95% confidence interval = 311 to 1104 mm(3); P =.03) and weighed less (1487 mg and 4162 mg, difference = 2675 mg, 95% confidence interval = 2103 to 3248 mg; P<.001) than those in vehicle-treated mice. Paricalcitol induced committed myeloid hematopoietic stem cells from wild-type but not from VDR knockout mice to differentiate as macrophages. CONCLUSION: Paricalcitol has anticancer activity against myeloid leukemia, myeloma, and colon cancer cells that may be mediated through the VDR. Because it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, clinical trials of this agent in certain cancers are reasonable.","['Kumagai, Takashi', ""O'Kelly, James"", 'Said, Jonathan W', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Kumagai T', ""O'Kelly J"", 'Said JW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, 90048, USA. kumamed1_2001@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '6702D36OG5 (paricalcitol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ergocalciferols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2003/06/19 05:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/06/19 05:00'],"['2003/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/95.12.896 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Jun 18;95(12):896-905. doi: 10.1093/jnci/95.12.896.,,,"['5P01 AT00151-03/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', '5P01 CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 CA26038-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Nonmyeloablative pretreatment was given to 42 patients with hematological diseases, 26 males and 16 females with the median age of 37, that were matched with the donors in terms of HLA, such as CD3 monoclonal antibody, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide (CTX) and cytarabine for patients with leukemia among which 6 were given fludarabine in addition, and CTX and antilymphocyte globulin for patients with myeloproliferative disease and aplastic anemia, thus practicing nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NAST). The incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and survival were observed. RESULTS: Donor-recipient hematopoietic cell chimerism was formed in 42 patients, with 18 cases of full donor chimerism (FDC) and 24 cases of mixed chimerism (MC). Of the 42 patients, 10 (23.8%) developed acute GVHD (aGVHD). The incidence of aGVHD in group MC (2/24, 8.9%) was significantly lower than that in group FDC (8/24, 44.4%, P < 0.05). In addition, eight (19.1%) developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD). The incidence of cGVHD was also lower in group MC (4/24, 16.7%) in comparison with 4/18 (23.2%) in group FDC (P > 0.05). There was no difference in recovery time of neutrophils and platelets (P > 0.05) between the two groups. Thirty-one patients still survived and there was no significant difference between the group FDC and MC in terms of survival rate and leukemia relapse rate. CONCLUSION: Compared with full donor chimerism, mixed chimerism significantly alleviates the incidence of aGVHD and does not delay the hematopoietic reconstitution. It may be an ideal model of engraftment that mixed chimerism converts to full donor chimerism within several months after NAST.","['Ai, Hui-sheng', 'Yu, Chang-lin', 'Wang, Dan-hong', 'Guo, Mei', 'Qiao, Jian-hui', 'Shi, Bao-fu', 'Sun, Wan-jun', 'Zhang, Shi', 'Sun, Qi-yun', 'Yao, Bo']","['Ai HS', 'Yu CL', 'Wang DH', 'Guo M', 'Qiao JH', 'Shi BF', 'Sun WJ', 'Zhang S', 'Sun QY', 'Yao B']","['Affiliated Hospital, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100039, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/06/19 05:00,2005/01/08 09:00,['2003/06/19 05:00'],"['2003/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Feb 10;83(3):208-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, it has been reported that caffeine induces p53-mediated apoptosis through Bax protein in non-small-cell lung cancer cells. Therefore, the effects of caffeine on cellular growth in malignant cells are controversial. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and induction of apoptosis in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells containing wild-type p53. Caffeine suppressed the cellular growth of NB4 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Caffeine induced G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest in NB4 cells in association with the induction of phosphorylation at the Ser-15 residue of p53 and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2. Expression of Bax protein was increased in NB4 cells after treatment with caffeine. Interestingly, the antisense oligonucleotides for p53 significantly reduced p53 expression and caffeine-induced G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest in NB4 cells. These results suggest that caffeine induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in association with activation of p53 by a novel pathway to phosphorylate the Ser-15 residue and induction of phosphorylation of cdc 2 in leukemic cells with normal p53.","['Ito, Keisuke', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Yamato, Kenji', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Ito K', 'Nakazato T', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Yamato K', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/08/12 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10289 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2003 Aug;196(2):276-83. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10289.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated the effect of methotrexate on mercaptopurine disposition in plasma and leukemic blasts during up-front treatment of 233 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Children were randomized to receive intravenous mercaptopurine (1 g/m(2) over a 6-hour period) or to receive methotrexate (low dose, 6 oral doses of 30 mg/m(2), or high dose, 1 g/m(2) intravenously), followed by intravenous mercaptopurine. All combinations have been previously used in frontline trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: Compared with mercaptopurine alone, methotrexate resulted in higher plasma mercaptopurine concentrations (30.3 +/- 14.7 micromol/L versus 23.5 +/- 18.0 micromol/L, P <.001) but, conversely, a 13-fold lower thioguanine nucleotide concentration (0.57 +/- 0.66 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells versus 7.4 +/- 15.2 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, P <.001) in bone marrow leukemic lymphoblasts. Methotrexate was also associated with higher plasma hypoxanthine concentrations compared with those of patients given mercaptopurine alone (8.7 +/- 13.5 micromol/L versus 3.8 +/- 2.5 micromol/L, P =.029). The percentage change in leukocyte counts measured over a 3-day period showed that mercaptopurine alone had little effect (mean decrease, 20% +/- 33%). In contrast, despite causing lower intracellular thiopurine active metabolite concentrations, methotrexate produced a greater decrease in leukocyte counts (mean, 53% +/- 35%) compared with those in patients receiving mercaptopurine alone (P <.0001). CONCLUSION: These pharmacologic findings in the target tissue are consistent with the recently demonstrated lack of clinical benefit of intravenous mercaptopurine in combination with methotrexate. We conclude that, in the setting of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, methotrexate antagonizes thiopurine metabolite disposition in leukemic blasts after intravenous mercaptopurine.","['Dervieux, Thierry', 'Hancock, Michael L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Boyett, James', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Dervieux T', 'Hancock ML', 'Pui CH', 'Rivera GK', 'Sandlund JT', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Boyett J', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Xanthines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine/metabolism', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/metabolism', 'Xanthines/metabolism']",,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S0009-9236(03)00063-8 [doi]', 'S0009923603000638 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2003 Jun;73(6):506-16. doi: 10.1016/S0009-9236(03)00063-8.,,,"['CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiling of mouse NIH 3T3 cells producing amphotropic mouse leukaemia virus 4070A revealed that 10 % of the 1176 cellular genes investigated were regulated by temperature shift (37/32 degrees C), while 5 % were affected by retrovirus infection. Strikingly, retrovirus production at 32 degrees C activated the cholesterol biosynthesis/transport pathway and caused an increase in plasma membrane cholesterol levels. Furthermore, these conditions resulted in transcriptional activation of smoothened (smo), patched (ptc) and gli-1; Smo, Ptc and Gli-1, as well as cholesterol, are components of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway, which directs pattern formation, diversification and tumourigenesis in mammalian cells.

A substantial proportion of these complex diseases arises in the setting of exposures to environmental or occupational toxins, including cytotoxic therapy for a prior malignancy or other disorder. The conversion of a normal stem cell into a preleukemic and ultimately leukemic state is a multistep process requiring the accumulation of a number of genetic lesions. At the genomic level, MDS is typified by losses and translocations involving certain key gene segments, with disruption of the normal structure and function of genes that control the balance of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursors. More than half of the chromosomal abnormalities in MDS comprise deletions of chromosomes 5, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 20. This evidence suggests that as yet unidentified tumor-suppressor genes should have important roles in the molecular mechanisms of MDS. Further molecular approaches to such genetic lesions will identify the relevant tumor-suppressor genes. Over the past years, major signal transduction molecules have been identified and their genetic alterations have been extensively analyzed in both MDS and leukemias. These include receptors for growth factors, RAS signaling molecules, cell cycle regulators and transcription factors. Notable among them are transcription factors that regulate both proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. The disruption of the normal flow of the signal transduction pathways involving these molecules translates into ineffective multilineage hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. Therefore, MDS provides a fertile testing ground on which we could study the molecular dissection implicated in the multistep leukemogenesis.","['Hirai, Hisamaru']",['Hirai H'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. hhirai-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",81,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/06/25 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/hyg037 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr;33(4):153-60. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyg037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This regulation is governed largely by its major negative regulator, Mdm2. In response to stress however, p53 accumulates and becomes activated. For this to occur, the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 have to be neutralized. Here we investigated the role of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in the activation of p53 in response to stress. We found that PML is critical for the accumulation of p53 in response to DNA damage under physiological conditions. PML protects p53 from Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, and from inhibition of apoptosis. PML neutralizes the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 by prolonging the stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20, a site of the checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2). PML recruits Chk2 and p53 into the PML nuclear bodies and enhances p53/Chk2 interaction.

These T cells were modified to produce a retrovirus under tight pharmacological control using the rapamycin-inducible transcriptional regulatory system. The retroviral vectors produced were transcriptionally targeted to CEA-expressing target cells. We found that vector production and transgene expression from these T cells in vitro was dependent on pharmacological induction and expression of CEA in target cells, respectively. Mice bearing metastatic tumors that received cell carriers delivering the HSVtk gene demonstrated a significant increase in survival, but only in response to pharmacological induction of vector production. Interestingly, the therapeutic effect required the presence of the tumor-specific chimeric receptor on T cells. Further studies demonstrated that systemic delivery of tumor-specific T cells to mice bearing metastatic tumors caused recruitment of nonspecific T cells to the tumor site.

Three of these patients coexpressed T and myeloid markers, suggesting the specific association of t(4;11)(q21;p15) with a subset of T-ALL originating from an early progenitor, which has the potential to express mature T-cell antigens as well as myeloid markers. We describe here a new NUP98 partner involved in a t(10;11)(q25;p15) in a patient with acute biphenotypic leukemia, showing coexpression of mature T and myeloid markers. The gene involved, located in 10q25, was identified as ADD3 using 3'-RACE. ADD3 codes for the ubiquitous expressed subunit gamma of the adducin protein, and it seems to play an important role in the skeletal organization of the cell membrane. Both NUP98-ADD3 and ADD3-NUP98 fusion transcripts are expressed in the patient. This is the second partner of NUP98 described in T-ALL. Adducin shares with the product of RAP1GDS1, and with all of the nonhomeobox NUP98 partners, the presence of a region with significant probability of adopting a coiled-coil conformation. This region is always retained in the fusion transcript with the NH(2) terminus FG repeats of NUP98, suggesting an important role in the mechanism of leukemogenesis.","['Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Vizmanos, Jose L', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Vazquez, Iria', 'Cigudosa, Juan C', 'Larrayoz, Maria J', 'Sala, Francisco', 'Gorosquieta, Ana', 'Perez-Equiza, Katy', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Lahortiga I', 'Vizmanos JL', 'Agirre X', 'Vazquez I', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Sala F', 'Gorosquieta A', 'Perez-Equiza K', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Odero MD']","['Department of Genetics, University of Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (NUP98-adducin 3 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Jun 15;63(12):3079-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that LIF is the physiological activator of STAT3, because in involuting mammary glands of Lif(-/-) mice, pSTAT3 is absent and the STAT3 target, C/EBPdelta, is not upregulated. Similar to Stat3 knockouts, Lif(-/-) mammary glands exhibit delayed involution, reduced apoptosis and elevated levels of p53. Significantly, Lif(-/-) glands display precocious development during pregnancy, when pSTAT3 is not normally detected. We show that pERK1/2 is significantly reduced in Lif(-/-) glands at this time, suggesting that at this stage LIF mediates its effects through pERK1/2. Inhibition of LIF-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation potentiates the proapoptotic effects of STAT3. LIF therefore signals alternately through ERK1/2, then STAT3, to regulate mammary growth and apoptosis.","['Kritikou, Ekaterini A', 'Sharkey, Andrew', 'Abell, Kathrine', 'Came, Paul J', 'Anderson, Elizabeth', 'Clarkson, Richard W E', 'Watson, Christine J']","['Kritikou EA', 'Sharkey A', 'Abell K', 'Came PJ', 'Anderson E', 'Clarkson RW', 'Watson CJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Caseins)', '0 (Contactins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (U 0126)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Caseins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Contactins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/drug effects/embryology/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/09/04 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1242/dev.00578 [doi]'],ppublish,Development. 2003 Aug;130(15):3459-68. doi: 10.1242/dev.00578.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, immunophenotypic analysis revealed the coexpression of the CD33 and CD7 antigens on common ALL blasts, in accordance with other reported cases that displayed a predominant biphenotypic leukemia profile. The patient failed to obtain a second remission and died soon after due to infective complications.

Molecular studies have shown that the AF10 gene at 10p12 is consistently a partner gene in cases with 10;11 rearrangement. A simple reciprocal translocation cannot lead to the known MLL-AF10 fusion transcript because the 3' part of the MLL gene is orientated to the telomere and the 3' part of the AF10 gene to the centromere. In a series of 1897 AML samples, 14 cases (0.74%) showed 10;11 rearrangements leading to a MLL-AF10 fusion transcript. These cases were analyzed in detail with G banding analyses, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular investigation in a single center. Five different mechanisms of (10;11) rearrangements leading to a MLL-AF10 fusion transcript can be observed (i.e., reciprocal translocations, insertions of either 10p into 11q or 11q into 10p, as well as complex and cryptic rearrangements).

The deletions were defined as del(15) (q12q21) (two cases) and del(15)(q11q21) (one case). Cytogenetic analysis was supplemented by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a chromosome 15 specific whole chromosome painting probe and probes hybridizing to the UBE3A gene on 15q11~q13, the PML gene on 15q22, and the telomeric region of 15q. Hereby, an interstitial deletion of 15q including UBE3A, but not PML and the telomeric region of 15q could be demonstrated.

In two cases, the aberration was found at the time of primary diagnosis, whereas the third case showed the del(15) only during relapse of leukemia. Both cases with acute leukemia did not adequately respond to intensive chemotherapeutic treatment and died 13 and 11 months, respectively, after primary diagnosis. Our findings and the data of five previously published cases with an isolated del(15) indicate that: 1) del(15) represents a rare but recurrent abnormality in myelocytic hemopathies; 2) in our cases, del(15) was interstitial and included the region 15q11~q13/UBE3A, but not 15q22/PML and the telomeric region of 15q as shown by FISH; 3) del(15) occurs frequently in disorders with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative features and may therefore affect early hematopoietic progenitor cells; and 4) del(15) may occur during disease progression and is often associated with an unfavorable prognosis.","['Dierlamm, Judith', 'Schilling, Georgia', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Hinz, Kristina', 'Murga Penas, Eva Maria', 'Seeger, Doris', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Hossfeld, Dieter Kurt']","['Dierlamm J', 'Schilling G', 'Michaux L', 'Hinz K', 'Murga Penas EM', 'Seeger D', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Departments of Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. judith_dierlamm@yahoo.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",7,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802008634 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00863-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Jul 1;144(1):1-5. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00863-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo administration of an engineered viral vector to promote fracture healing represents a potential high-efficacy, low-risk procedure. We selected a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector, because this vector would be expected to target transgene expression to the proliferating periosteal cells arising shortly after bone fracture. This vector transduced a hybrid gene that consisted of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 transgene with the BMP-2 secretory signal to enhance the secretion of mature BMP-4. The MLV vector expressing this BMP-2/4 hybrid gene or beta-galactosidase control gene was administered at the lateral side of the fracture periosteum at 1 day after fracture in the rat femoral fracture model. X-ray examination by radiograph and peripheral quantitative computed tomography at 7, 14, and 28 days after fracture revealed a highly significant enhancement of fracture tissue size in the MLV-BMP-2/4-treated fractures compared to the control fractures. The tissue was extensively ossified at 14 and 28 days, and the newly formed bone exhibited normal bone histology. This tissue also exhibited strong immunohistochemical staining of BMP-4. Additional control and MLV-BMP-2/4-treated animals each were monitored for 70 days to determine the fate of the markedly enhanced fracture callus. Radiographs showed that the hard callus had been remodeled and substantial healing at the fracture site had occurred, suggesting that the union of the bone at the fracture site was at least as high in the BMP-4-treated bone as in the control bone. There was no evidence of viral vector infection of extraskeletal tissues, suggesting that this in vivo gene therapy for fracture repair is safe. In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that a MLV-based retroviral vector is a safe and effective means of introducing a transgene to a fracture site and that this procedure caused an enormous augmentation of fracture bone formation.","['Rundle, Charles H', 'Miyakoshi, Naohisa', 'Kasukawa, Yuji', 'Chen, Shin-Tai', 'Sheng, Matilda H-C', 'Wergedal, Jon E', 'Lau, K-H William', 'Baylink, David J']","['Rundle CH', 'Miyakoshi N', 'Kasukawa Y', 'Chen ST', 'Sheng MH', 'Wergedal JE', 'Lau KH', 'Baylink DJ']","['Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Loma Linda University, and the Jerry L.

STAP-2 was identical to a recently cloned adaptor molecule, BKS, a substrate of BRK (breast tumor kinase) tyrosine kinase, although its function is still unknown. To examine a novel function of STAP-2/BSK, we expressed STAP-2/BSK or its mutants in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Overexpression of STAP-2/BSK resulted in a suppression of FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium mobilization and degranulation.

These data indicate that STAP-2/BSK negatively controls the FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium mobilization and degranulation by direct modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma.","['Yamamoto, Tetsuya', 'Yumioka, Taro', 'Sekine, Yuichi', 'Sato, Noriko', 'Minoguchi, Mayu', 'Yoshimura, Akihiko', 'Matsuda, Tadashi']","['Yamamoto T', 'Yumioka T', 'Sekine Y', 'Sato N', 'Minoguchi M', 'Yoshimura A', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-Ku Kita 12 Nishi 6, 060-0812, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAP2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phospholipase C gamma', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology/physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/08/15 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03010428 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01042-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Jul 4;306(3):767-73. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01042-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had been suffering from a high fever because of pneumonia. He was icteric and his serum concentrations of total and direct bilirubin were 13.1 and 7.9 mg/dl, respectively. However, the other standard biochemical examinations for hepatic function, such as serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase were normal except for lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme analysis revealed that the high concentration was derived from leukemia cells. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed no abnormality in the liver or biliary tract. Administration of antibiotics for pneumonia decreased the serum bilirubin concentration, however, he died because of respiratory failure caused by the progression of pneumonia at 33 days after the admission.

Furthermore, HIV Vif can protect MLV from this CEM15/APOBEC3G-dependent restriction.

To evaluate the interactions of these proteins with GPCRs in greater detail, we generated a fusion protein between the N-formyl peptide receptor and the G(alpha)(i2) protein. The functional capabilities of this chimeric protein were determined both in vivo, in stably transfected U937 cells, and in vitro, using a novel reconstitution system of solubilized components. The chimeric protein exhibited a cellular ligand binding affinity indistinguishable from that of the wild-type receptor and existed as a complex, when solubilized, containing betagamma subunits, as demonstrated by sucrose density sedimentation. The chimeric protein mobilized intracellular calcium and desensitized normally in response to agonist. Furthermore, the chimeric receptor was internalized and recycled at rates similar to those of the wild-type FPR. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that internalized chimeric receptors, as identified with fluorescent ligand, colocalized with arrestin, as well as G protein, unlike wild-type receptors. Soluble reconstitution experiments demonstrated that the chimeric receptor, even in the phosphorylated state, existed as a high ligand affinity G protein complex, in the absence of exogenous G protein. This interaction was only partially prevented through the addition of arrestins. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the GTP-bound state of the G protein alpha subunit displays no detectable affinity for the receptor. Together, these results indicate that complex interactions exist between GPCRs, in their unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states, G proteins, and arrestins, which result in the highly regulated control of GPCR function.","['Shi, Mei', 'Bennett, Teresa A', 'Cimino, Daniel F', 'Maestas, Diane C', 'Foutz, Terry D', 'Gurevich, Vsevolod V', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Prossnitz, Eric R']","['Shi M', 'Bennett TA', 'Cimino DF', 'Maestas DC', 'Foutz TD', 'Gurevich VV', 'Sklar LA', 'Prossnitz ER']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Arrestin)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GNAI2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunit, Gi2)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Gnai2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arrestin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcium/chemistry/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunit, Gi2', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/genetics/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Ultracentrifugation/methods']",,2003/06/18 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/18 05:00'],"['2003/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi0341657 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2003 Jun 24;42(24):7283-93. doi: 10.1021/bi0341657.,,,"['1 S10 RR14668/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI36357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43932/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'EY11500/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM60799/EB00264/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM63097/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR11830/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA88339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01315/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases of SBL, immature T cell type patients were younger than B-2 cell type ones. The lymphoma originating from B cells differed from that originating from T cells in morphology. In T cell tumors, the nucleus of tumor cells was round, the edge of the cytoplasm obvious, and tumor cells were sporadically present and proliferated. When compared with T cells, the region among B cells was obscure. But, there was no relation between phenotype and the histologic classification of tumor cells. In EBL, beyond the lymph node, tumors of B-1a and B-1b types had developed in the heart and abomasum, and those of the B-2 type tended to occur in liver. In SBL, B-2 type and T type cells formed tumors in the liver, kidney, thymus, and one case of T-cell type tumor formed on the skin.

Recently, it has been reported that imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase useful in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, is also effective in treating HES; however, the molecular target of imatinib in HES is unknown. This report identifies a genetic rearrangement in the eosinophilic cell line EOL-1 that results in the expression of a fusion protein comprising an N-terminal region encoded by a gene of unknown function with the GenBank accession number NM_030917 and a C-terminal region derived from the intracellular domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha). The fusion gene was also detected in blood cells from two patients with HES. We propose naming NM_030917 Rhe for Rearranged in hypereosinophilia. Rhe-PDGFRalpha fusions result from an apparent interstitial deletion that links Rhe to exon 12 of PDGFRalpha on chromosome 4q12. The fusion kinase Rhe-PDGFRalpha is constitutively phosphorylated and supports IL-3-independent growth when expressed in BaF3 cells.

The T-cell leukemia-derived cell line Jurkat has generally been used as a model system for the activation of T cells. However, genome-wide comprehensive studies investigating the activation status, and thus the appropriateness, of this cell line for this purpose have not been performed. We sought to compare the transcriptional profiles of phenotypically purified human CD2(+) T cells with those of Jurkat T cells during T-cell activation, using cDNA microarrays containing 6912 genes. About 300 genes were up-regulated by more than 2-fold during activation of both peripheral blood (PB) T cells and Jurkat T cells. The number of down-regulated genes was significantly lower than that of up-regulated genes. Only 79 genes in PB T cells and 37 genes in Jurkat T cells were down-regulated by more than 2-fold during activation. Comparison of gene expression during activation of Jurkat and PB T cells revealed a common set of genes that were up-regulated, such as Rho GTPase-activating protein 1, SKP2, CDC25A, T-cell specific transcription factor 7, cytoskeletal proteins, and signaling molecules. Genes that were commonly down-regulated in both PB T cells and Jurkat T cells included CDK inhibitors (p16, p19, p27), proapoptotic caspases, and the transcription factors c-fos and jun-B. After activation, 71 genes in PB T cells and only 3 genes in Jurkat T cells were up-regulated 4-fold or more. Of these up-regulated genes and expressed sequence tags, 44 were constitutively expressed at high levels in nonactivated Jurkat cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed our microarray data. Our findings indicate that although there is significant overlap in the activation-associated transcriptional profiles in PB T cells compared with Jurkat T cells, there is a subset of genes showing differential expression patterns during the activation of the two cell types.","['Lin, Zhaosheng', 'Fillmore, G Chris', 'Um, Tae-Hyun', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J', 'Lim, Megan S']","['Lin Z', 'Fillmore GC', 'Um TH', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS', 'Lim MS']","['Department of Pathology, ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'CD2 Antigens/immunology', 'Enzymes/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2003/06/17 05:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/06/17 05:00'],"['2003/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.lab.0000073130.58435.e5 [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Invest. 2003 Jun;83(6):765-76. doi: 10.1097/01.lab.0000073130.58435.e5.,,,['CA83984-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression in mice of the APL-associated fusion, PML-RARA, initially has only modest effects on myelopoiesis. Whereas treatment of control animals with interleukin-3 (IL-3) resulted in expanded myelopoiesis without a block in differentiation, PML-RARA abrogated differentiation that normally characterizes the response to IL-3. Retroviral transduction of bone marrow with an IL-3-expressing retrovirus revealed that IL-3 and promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) combined to generate a lethal leukemia-like syndrome in <21 days. We also observed that a constitutively activated mutant IL-3 receptor, beta(c)V449E, cooperated with PML-RARalpha in leukemogenesis, whereas a different activated mutant, beta(c)I374N, did not. Analysis of additional mutations introduced into beta(c)V449E showed that, although tyrosine phosphorylation of beta(c) is necessary for cooperation, the Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein binding site is dispensable. Our results indicate that chimeric transcription factors can block the differentiative effects of growth factors. This combination can be potently leukemogenic, but the particular manner in which these types of mutations interact determines the ability of such combinations to generate acute myeloid leukemia.","['Phan, Vernon T', 'Shultz, David B', 'Truong, Bao-Tran H', 'Blake, Timothy J', 'Brown, Anna L', 'Gonda, Thomas J', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Phan VT', 'Shultz DB', 'Truong BT', 'Blake TJ', 'Brown AL', 'Gonda TJ', 'Le Beau MM', 'Kogan SC']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,2003/06/17 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/06/17 05:00'],"['2003/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.13.4573-4585.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Jul;23(13):4573-85. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.13.4573-4585.2003.,,,"['U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Jul;25(13):5787'],,PMC164846,,,,,,,

Cytoplasmic PTEN expression was observed in the majority of cell lines (87%), whereas a minor subset demonstrated nuclear expression. Phosphorylated AKT was also expressed predominantly within the cytoplasm in 65% of cell lines, whereas nuclear expression was seen in a minority. An inverse relationship between PTEN and phosphorylated AKT was observed in 63% of cell lines. No cell lines showed absence of PTEN expression, whereas 50% of cell lines showed low PTEN expression.

Active forms of Notch1 consisting of a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain (Notch1TM) or only an intracellular domain (Notch1IC) function as oncoproteins. To elucidate the effect of Notch1 abnormalities in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis, we determined the structure of the Notch1 gene and examined the frequency and the sites of Notch1 rearrangements in radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomas. The Notch1 gene consists of 37 exons, including three exons upstream of the previously reported exon 1. The transcript starting from exon 1 was the major transcript whereas the transcripts read upstream from exon 1a, in which amino acid sequences in the N-terminal region were changed, were minor. More than 50% of radiation-induced thymic lymphomas exhibited Notch1 rearrangements, suggesting that Notch1 acts as a major oncogene in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis. We identified three rearranged sites: novel sites in the 5' end region encompassing exons 1 and 2, the previously identified juxtamembrane extracellular region, and the 3' end region. The 5' deletion and the insertion of murine leukemia virus in the juxtamembrane region led to the production of abnormal transcripts starting from cryptic transcription start sites located halfway through the Notch1 gene and resulted in transcripts lacking most of the extracellular domain. As a result of these rearrangements, truncated Notch1 polypeptides resembling Notch1TM or Notch1IC were formed.

The downstream target gene Hes1 was transcribed in a lymphoma with insertion of murine leukemia virus, but not in a lymphoma with a 5' deletion. These results indicate that in addition to Hes1 expression, other Notch1 pathway(s) have a role in thymic lymphomagenesis and suggest the presence of a novel mechanism for oncogenic activation of Notch1 by 5' deletion.","['Tsuji, Hideo', 'Ishii-Ohba, Hiroko', 'Ukai, Hideki', 'Katsube, Takanori', 'Ogiu, Toshiaki']","['Tsuji H', 'Ishii-Ohba H', 'Ukai H', 'Katsube T', 'Ogiu T']","['Low Dose Radiation Effects Research Project Group, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1, Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8555, Japan. tsujihid@nirs.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'DNA/*radiation effects', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/virology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/chemistry', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', '*Transcription Factors']",,2003/06/17 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/06/17 05:00'],"['2003/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgg071 [doi]', 'bgg071 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2003 Jul;24(7):1257-68. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgg071.

The sensitivity of leukaemic cells to corticosteroids has emerged as an important prognostic factor in ALL. The t(9,22) translocation, resulting in the bcr-abl fusion gene, is a non-random translocation found in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It is also known to be an independent poor prognostic factor for long-term disease free survival. We studied the association between the presence of bcr-abl fusion gene and in vitro prednisolone resistance in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 23 children (aged 1-16 yr, median age: 12 yr) with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at diagnosis were included in the study. The presence of bcr-abl fusion gene was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the in-vitro resistance to prednisolone was measured by short term colorimetric methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. RESULTS: A median LD50 (lethal dose for 50% cells) for prednisolone in bcr-abl positive children (n=7) was 1.6 mg/ml (range: 0.25-5.0 mg/ml) and that of bcr-abl negative children (n=16) was 0.35 mg/ml (range 0.62-1.0 mg/ml). The median LD50 for prednisolone differed significantly between the bcr-abl positive and negative groups of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (P<0.005). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This is probably the first report to show that leukaemic blasts of bcr-abl positive children with ALL are about four-fold resistant to prednisolone as compared to blasts from bcr-abl negative children. This suggests that one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of bcr-abl positive ALL could be a lower steroid sensitivity.","['Gupta, Mamta', 'Kumar, Anil', 'Dabadghao, Sunil']","['Gupta M', 'Kumar A', 'Dabadghao S']","['Department of Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis']",,2003/06/17 05:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/06/17 05:00'],"['2003/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2002 Dec;116:268-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither IFN formulation was effective in inducing apoptosis in WM9 melanoma cells, but both increased slightly the percentage of ACHN cells undergoing apoptosis as assessed by Annexin V staining. Interferon-alpha2b and PEG-IFN-alpha2b both activated signal transducer and activator of transcription complexes, and the duration of complex activation was similar for both IFN formulations.

Together, the drug comparability and cell sensitivity data suggest a predictive relation between dose, time, antiviral activity, and gene transcription effects.

Monkey and human ES cell lines, which are very similar to each other, have been established from monkey blastocysts and surplus human blastocysts from fertility clinics. Nonhuman primate ES cell lines provide important research tools for basic and applicative research. Firstly, they provide wider aspects of investigation of the regulative mechanisms of stem cells and cell differentiation among primate species. Secondly, their usage does not need clearance or permission from the regulative rules in many countries that are associated with the ethical aspects of human ES cells, although human and nonhuman embryos and fetuses are very similar to each other. Lastly and most importantly, they are indispensable for animal models of cell therapy to test effectiveness, safety, and immunological reaction of the allogenic transplantation in a setting similar to the treatment of human diseases. So far, ES cell lines have been established from rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), using blastocysts produced naturally or by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These cell lines seem to have very similar characteristics. They express alkaline phosphatase activity and stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4 and, in most cases, SSEA-3. Their pluripotency was confirmed by the formation of embryoid bodies and differentiation into various cell types in culture and also by the formation of teratomas that contained many types of differentiated tissues including derivatives of three germ layers after transplantation into the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. The noneffectiveness of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signal makes culture of primate and human ES cell lines prone to undergo spontaneous differentiation and thus it is difficult to maintain these stem cell colonies. Also, these ES cells are more susceptible to various stresses, causing difficulty with subculturing using enzymatic treatment and cloning from single cells. However, with various improvements in culture methods, it is now possible to maintain stable colonies of monkey ES cells using a serum-free medium and subculturing with trypsin treatment. Under such conditions, cynomolgus monkey ES cell lines can be maintained in an undifferentiated state with a normal karyotype and pluripotency even after prolonged periods of culture over 1 year. Such progress should facilitate many aspects of stem cell research using both nonhuman primate and human ES cell lines.","['Nakatsuji, Norio', 'Suemori, Hirofumi']","['Nakatsuji N', 'Suemori H']","['Department of Development and Differentiation, Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan. nnakatsu@frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,,IM,"['Animals', 'Callithrix', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Macaca mulatta', '*Primates', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",33,2003/06/14 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1100/tsw.2002.829 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2002 Jun 26;2:1762-73. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2002.829.,,20020626,,,,,,,PMC6009524,,,,,,,

Recently, a large increase in incidence of thyroid cancer was observed in children exposed to radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. A high prevalence of chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET gene was found among these radiation-induced thyroid tumors.

PCB 104 increased the oxidative stress in endothelial cells, as determined by the increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and rhodamine 123 fluorescence. In addition, PCB 104 markedly upregulated the expression of MCP-1, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. These effects were time- and concentration-dependent. The maximum expression of inflammatory genes was observed in endothelial cells exposed to 20 microM of PCB 104 for 1 or 2 h, depending on the specific gene. In addition, PCB 104 elevated the adhesion of THP-1 cells (a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) to endothelial cell monolayers. These results indicate that PCB 104 is a potent stimulant of inflammatory mediators in human vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesize that these proinflammatory processes may contribute to the development of cancer metastasis and/or atherogenesis in patients exposed to PCBs.","['Choi, Wangsun', 'Eum, Sung Yong', 'Lee, Yong Woo', 'Hennig, Bernhard', 'Robertson, Larry W', 'Toborek, Michal']","['Choi W', 'Eum SY', 'Lee YW', 'Hennig B', 'Robertson LW', 'Toborek M']","['Department of Surgery, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)', ""Z4YYF101N3 (2,2',4,6,6'-pentachlorobiphenyl)""]",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'E-Selectin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/toxsci/kfg149 [doi]', 'kfg149 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2003 Sep;75(1):47-56. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfg149.

This cell line is unique in its response to the ecotropic MLV envelope protein (Env) in that it undergoes syncytium formation with cells expressing Env protein containing R peptide (R(+) Env), which is known to suppress the fusogenic potential of the Env protein in other susceptible cells. To analyze the ecotropic receptor, CAT1, in XC cells, a mouse CAT1 tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (mCAT1-HA)-expressing retroviral vector was inoculated into XC and NIH 3T3 cells. The molecular size of the mCAT1-HA protein expressed in XC cells was smaller than that in NIH 3T3 cells due to altered N glycosylation in XC cells. Treatment of XC cells with tunicamycin significantly suppressed the formation of XC cell syncytia induced by the R(+) Env protein but not that induced by the R(-) Env protein. This result indicates that N glycosylation is required for XC cell-specific syncytium formation by the R(+) Env protein. The R(+) Env protein induced syncytia in XC cells expressing a mutant mCAT1 lacking both of two N glycosylation sites, and tunicamycin treatment suppressed syncytium formation by R(+) Env in those cells. This suggests that N glycosylation of a molecule(s) other than the receptor is required for the induction of XC cell syncytia by the R(+) Env protein.","['Kubo, Yoshinao', 'Ishimoto, Akinori', 'Amanuma, Hiroshi']","['Kubo Y', 'Ishimoto A', 'Amanuma H']","['Molecular Cell Science Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, USA. yoshinao@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', '*Giant Cells', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.13.7510-7516.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jul;77(13):7510-6. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.13.7510-7516.2003.,,,,,,,,,PMC164801,,,,,,,

Tax-mediated regulation of gene expression is important for the immortalization of normal human T lymphocytes and the transformation of fibroblast cells, such as Rat-1 cells. Tax has the ability to transactivate p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1), resulting in high expression levels in HTLV-1-immortalized cells. Since p21 expression is suppressed due to methylation of the promoter region in Rat-l cell line, p21 may not be critical for the transformation of this cell line by Tax. To further understand the role of p21 for the proliferation of Tax-transformed Rat-1 cells, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of p21 in these cells. Here, we observed that p21 expression enhanced the transformation of this cell line via at least two mechanisms: (i) the enhancement of NF-kappaB activation and/or CREB signaling and (ii) the excitation of antiapoptotic machinery. To analyze the role of p21 that is overexpressed in HTLV-1-immortalized lymphocytes, p21 expression was suppressed by using an antisense oligonucleotide specific for p21 mRNA; these cells then became sensitive to apoptotic induction. These results suggest that p21 plays an important role in the proliferation of Tax-expressing cells through the regulation of at least two independent mechanisms.","['Kawata, Sanae', 'Ariumi, Yasuo', 'Shimotohno, Kunitada']","['Kawata S', 'Ariumi Y', 'Shimotohno K']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/physiology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.13.7291-7299.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jul;77(13):7291-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.13.7291-7299.2003.,,,,,,,,,PMC164826,,,,,,,

REBP is a nuclear protein that colocalizes with Rev in the nucleoplasm and nuclear periphery of transfected cells. Specific, albeit weak, interaction between REBP and Rev could be demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation assays in BSC-40 cells. REBP can modestly enhance Rev-dependent RRE-linked reporter gene expression both independently and in cooperation with the nucleoporin cofactor Rab/hRIP.

A significant fraction of PB1-F2 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane in influenza A virus-infected cells. PB1-F2 appears to enhance virus-induced cell death in a cell type-dependent manner. For the present communication we have identified and characterized a region near the COOH terminus of PB1-F2 that is necessary and sufficient for its inner mitochondrial membrane localization, as determined by transient expression of chimeric proteins consisting of elements of PB1-F2 genetically fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in HeLa cells. Targeting of EGFP to mitochondria by this sequence resulted in the loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to cell death. The mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) is predicted to form a positively charged amphipathic alpha-helix and, as such, is similar to the MTS of the p13(II) protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. We formally demonstrate the functional interchangeability of the two sequences for mitochondrial localization of PB1-F2. Mutation analysis of the putative amphipathic helix in the PB1-F2 reveals that replacement of five basic amino acids with Ala abolishes mitochondrial targeting, whereas mutation of two highly conserved Leu to Ala does not. These findings demonstrate that PB1-F2 possesses an MTS similar to other viral proteins and that this MTS, when fused to EGFP, is capable of independently compromising mitochondrial function and cellular viability.","['Gibbs, James S', 'Malide, Daniela', 'Hornung, Felicita', 'Bennink, Jack R', 'Yewdell, Jonathan W']","['Gibbs JS', 'Malide D', 'Hornung F', 'Bennink JR', 'Yewdell JW']","['Laboratory of Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*physiology', 'Intracellular Membranes/physiology/virology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.13.7214-7224.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jul;77(13):7214-24. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.13.7214-7224.2003.,,,,,,,,,PMC164823,,,,,,,

To determine how perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might affect ts1-mediated neurodegeneration, the virus was introduced into transgenic mice in which the assembly of ubiquitin chains was compromised by the expression of dominant-negative mutant ubiquitin. The onset of symptoms was greatly delayed in a transgenic mouse line expressing K48R mutant ubiquitin; no such delay was observed in mice expressing a wild-type ubiquitin transgene or K63R mutant ubiquitin. The extended latency was found to correlate with a delayed increase in viral titers. Pathological findings in K48R transgenic mice at 60 days were found to be similar to those in the other strains at 30 days, suggesting that while delayed, the neurodegenerative process in K48R mice was otherwise similar.

For RA to induce its biological effects in target cells, binding to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors is required. The resulting complexes bind to RA-responsive elements (RAREs) in the promoters of RA-inducible genes to initiate gene transcription and to generate protein products that mediate the biological effects of RA. In this report, we provide evidence that a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKC delta, is activated during RA treatment of the NB-4 and HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Such RA-dependent phosphorylation was also observed in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and resulted in activation of the kinase domain of PKC delta. In studies aimed at understanding the functional relevance of PKC delta in the induction of RA responses, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PKC delta (but not of other PKC isoforms) diminished RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. On the other hand, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the kinase strongly enhanced RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. Gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that PKC delta associated with retinoic acid receptor-alpha and was present in an RA-inducible protein complex that bound to RAREs. Pharmacological inhibition of PKC delta activity abrogated the induction of cell differentiation and growth inhibition of NB-4 blast cells, demonstrating that its function is required for such effects. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence that PKC delta is activated in an RA-dependent manner and plays a critical role in the generation of the biological effects of RA in malignant cells.","['Kambhampati, Suman', 'Li, Yongzhong', 'Verma, Amit', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Majchrzak, Beata', 'Deb, Dilip K', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Giafis, Nick', 'Kalvakolanu, Dhananjaya V', 'Rahman, Arshad', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Kambhampati S', 'Li Y', 'Verma A', 'Sassano A', 'Majchrzak B', 'Deb DK', 'Parmar S', 'Giafis N', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Rahman A', 'Uddin S', 'Minucci S', 'Tallman MS', 'Fish EN', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Preclinical observations have indicated that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) may strongly enhance the response to ATO. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, we conducted a randomized study of ATO alone versus ATO plus ATRA in 20 patients with relapsed APL, all previously treated with ATRA-containing chemotherapy. The primary objective was to demonstrate a significant reduction in the time necessary to obtain a complete remission (CR) in the ATO/ATRA group compared with the ATO group. Secondary objectives were safety and molecular response. RESULTS: The CR rate after one ATO with or without ATRA induction cycle was 80%. Clinical and pharmacokinetic observations indicated that the main mechanism of action of ATO in vivo was the induction of APL cell differentiation. Hematologic and molecular response, time necessary to reach CR, and outcome were comparable in both treatment groups. Of 16 CR patients, three patients who reached a molecular remission after one induction cycle had all received chemotherapy for a treatment-induced hyperleukocytosis. Three additional patients who received further additional ATO with or without ATRA cycles converted later to molecular negativity. CONCLUSION: ATRA did not seem to significantly improve the response to ATO in patients relapsing from APL. Other potential combinations, including ATO plus chemotherapy, have to be tested.","['Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Poupon, Joel', 'Daniel, Marie-Therese', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Delarue, Richard', 'Taksin, Anne-Laure', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Tibi, Annick', 'Lebbe, Genevieve', 'Cimerman, Patricia', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Fermand, Jean-Paul', 'de The, Hugues', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Raffoux E', 'Rousselot P', 'Poupon J', 'Daniel MT', 'Cassinat B', 'Delarue R', 'Taksin AL', 'Rea D', 'Buzyn A', 'Tibi A', 'Lebbe G', 'Cimerman P', 'Chomienne C', 'Fermand JP', 'de The H', 'Degos L', 'Hermine O', 'Dombret H']","['Department and Institute of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/07/24 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.01.149 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.01.149 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jun 15;21(12):2326-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.01.149.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tested whether older patients were offered trials significantly less often than younger patients and whether older patients who were offered trials were more likely to refuse participation than younger patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 10 Cancer and Leukemia Group B institutions, using a retrospective case-control design, breast cancer patients eligible for an open treatment trial were paired: less than 65 years old and > or = 65 years old. Each of the 77 pairs were matched by disease stage and treating physician. Patients were interviewed as to their reasons for participating or refusing to participate in a trial. The treating physicians were also given questionnaires about their reasons for offering or not offering a trial. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of younger stage II patients were offered a trial compared with 34% of the older patients (P =.0004). In multivariate analyses, disease stage and age remained highly significant in predicting trial offering (P =.0008), when controlling for physical functioning and comorbidity. Of those offered a trial, there was no significant difference in participation between younger (56%) and older (50%) patients (P =.67). CONCLUSION: In a multivariate analysis including comorbid conditions, age and stage were the only predictors of whether a patient was offered a trial. The greatest impediment to enrolling older women onto trials in the setting of this study was the physicians' perceptions about age and tolerance of toxicity.","['Kemeny, M Margaret', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Muss, Hyman B', 'Wheeler, Judith', 'Levine, Ellis', 'Bartlett, Nancy', 'Fleming, Gini', 'Cohen, Harvey J']","['Kemeny MM', 'Peterson BL', 'Kornblith AB', 'Muss HB', 'Wheeler J', 'Levine E', 'Bartlett N', 'Fleming G', 'Cohen HJ']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B and the University ofChicago Medical Center, IL, USA. kemenym@nychhc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aging', 'Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', '*Patient Participation', 'Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/07/24 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.09.124 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.09.124 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jun 15;21(12):2268-75. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.09.124.,,,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec 1;22(23):4811'],,,,,,,,,

In an unselected series of 1897 AML cases, 54 patients with an 11q23/MLL rearrangement were identified, resulting in an incidence of 2.8%. The incidence of AML with MLL rearrangement was significantly higher in therapy-related AML (t-AML) than in de novo AML (9.4% vs 2.6%, P <.0001). The frequency of MLL rearrangements was significantly higher in patients younger than 60 years (5.3% vs 0.8%, P <.0001). While the incidence of MLL rearrangements in AML M4, M5a, and M5b was 4.7%, 33.3%, and 15.9%, respectively, it was found in only 0.9% of all other French-American-British (FAB) subtypes (P <.0001). Compared with AML with intermediate karyotype, AML with 11q23/MLL rearrangement had a worse outcome, which was rather comparable with AML with unfavorable karyotype. Compared with t-AML, the median overall survival (OS) of de novo AML with MLL rearrangement was significantly better (2.5 vs 10 months, P =.0143). No significant differences in median OS were observed between cases with t(9;11) compared with all other MLL rearrangements (10.0 vs 8.9 months, P =.36). In conclusion, the category AML with 11q23/MLL abnormalities accounts for 2.8% of unselected AML, is closely associated with monocytic differentiation, and has a dismal prognosis.

Polymorphic NAT is coded for rapid or slow acetylatoion phenotypes, which are recognized to affect cancer risk related to environmental exposure. Aloe-emodin has been shown to exit anticancer activity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not aloe-emodin could affect arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and gene expression (NAT mRNA) and DNA-2-aminofluorene (DNA-AF) adduct formation in mouse leukemia cells (L 1210). By using high performance liquid chromatography, N-acetylation and non-N-acetylation of AF were determined and quantitated. By using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR, NAT mRNA was determined and quantitated. Aloe-emodin displayed a dose-dependent inhibition to cytosolic NAT activity and intact mice leukemia cells. Time-course experiments indicated that N-acetylation of AF measured from intact mice leukemia cells were inhibited by aloe-emodin for up to 24h. Using standard steady-state kinetic analysis, it was demonstrated that aloe-emodin was a possible uncompetitive inhibitor to NAT activity in cytosols. The DNA-AF adduct formation in mouse leukemia cells were inhibited by aloe-emodin. The NAT1 mRNA in mouse leukemia cells were also inhibited by aloe-emodin. This report is the first demonstration which showed aloe-emodin affect mice leukemia cells NAT activity, gene expression (NAT1 mRNA) and DNA-AF on adduct formation.","['Chung, Jing-Gung', 'Li, Yu-Ching', 'Lee, Yi-Min', 'Lin, Jing-Pin', 'Cheng, Kwork-Chui', 'Chang, Weng-Cheng']","['Chung JG', 'Li YC', 'Lee YM', 'Lin JP', 'Cheng KC', 'Chang WC']","['Department of Microbiology, China Medical College, 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung 400, Taiwan, ROC. jgchung@mail.cmc.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '3A69OS195N (2-aminofluorene)', '9M98QLJ2DL (2-Acetylaminofluorene)', 'C8IYT9CR7C (aloe emodin)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['2-Acetylaminofluorene/metabolism', 'Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Anthraquinones', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Adducts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Emodin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fluorenes/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603000171 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00017-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Sep;27(9):831-40. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00017-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examined the mRNA and protein for IL-18 in eight human hematopoietic cell lines representing different lineages and neoplasms including leukemia, lymphoma and others. Our results revealed that IL-18 mRNA was expressed in these cells and that the corresponding protein was found in the cytoplasm. Seven of eight cell lines were also found to express two subunits of the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) at varied levels. Furthermore, 29 out of 51 leukemia patients tested were observed to express IL-18R with 18/29 (62%) co-expression of both receptor and ligand. By blocking the IL-18 loop using specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASON) for IL-18 mRNA or anti-human IL-18R monoclonal antibody (McAbR), we were not able to demonstrate a marked inhibition on the most leukemic cell lines growth. Moreover, the potential proliferation in vitro of primary AML cells co-expressing IL-18 and its receptor was not significantly enhanced by recombinant human IL-18, suggesting that IL-18 is not apparently implicated in the proliferation of the leukemia cells via an autocrine loop. Additionally, we also found the effective modulating effect of M-CSF, IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha on IL-18R expression, implying an important in vivo effect of cytokines on IL-18-induced reaction. Moreover, the modulation of IL-18R expression was possibly irrelevant to IFN-gamma secretion induced by these cytokines.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Ma, Xiao-Tong', 'Zheng, Guo-Guang', 'Li, Ge', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wu, Ke-Fu']","['Zhang B', 'Ma XT', 'Zheng GG', 'Li G', 'Rao Q', 'Wu KF']","['National Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (IL18R1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Interleukin-18 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-18)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Interleukin-18/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-18 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-18', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603000055 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00005-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Sep;27(9):813-22. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00005-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a variety of human tumors, the IGF-II gene is overexpressed and considered to be a stimulator for tumor growth through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The IGF-II gene is normally parental imprinted, only the paternal allele being expressed in most tissues. Several reports about biallelic expression (loss of imprinting (LOI)) of the IGF-II gene in different tumors suggest a role of dysregulation of IGF-II imprinting in tumorigenesis. However, biallelic expression of IGF-II gene has also been reported in different tissues of a significant number of normal controls, indicating either a normal phenomenon or an elevated cancer risk in this group of persons. Although LOI of IGF-II presumably promotes tumorigenesis by increasing IGF-II expression, elevated IGF-II levels in those patients have not been reported. We studied IGF-II gene expression in malignant lymphoblasts of 124 children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 196 cord blood samples from healthy newborns and mononuclear cells (MNC) from 50 healthy age matched children. The ApaI polymorphism in exon 9 of the IGF-II gene and allele-specific exon-connection RT-PCR was used for determination of the imprinting status. From 44 informative ALL-patients, 24 (54%) showed LOI of the IGF-II gene. Twenty percent of the informative cord blood samples (N=56) and 14% of the informative MNC samples from healthy controls (N=22) showed biallelic expression of IGF-II. In the ALL-patients, no statistical significant correlation between LOI patients and relapse rate, surviving rate and risk groups could be detected. We conclude that LOI of IGF-II occurs in malignant lymphoblasts of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia in more than 50% of the patients. In MNC from cord blood and peripheral MNC from healthy controls, biallelic expression could be detected in up to 20% of all cases. The importance of LOI in ALL-patients needs to be further evaluated to determine its impact in leukemogenesis.","['Vorwerk, Peter', 'Wex, Heike', 'Bessert, Cornelia', 'Hohmann, Bianka', 'Schmidt, Uwe', 'Mittler, Uwe']","['Vorwerk P', 'Wex H', 'Bessert C', 'Hohmann B', 'Schmidt U', 'Mittler U']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Otto von Guericke University, Emanuel-Larisch-Weg 17-19, D-39112 Magdeburg, Germany. peter.vorwerk@medizin.uni-magdeburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GGGCCC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603000146 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00014-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Sep;27(9):807-12. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00014-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Troublesome splenomegaly is uncommon in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but when organomegaly occurs, this complication is more likely to be associated with myelodysplastic-myeloproliferative overlap syndromes such as CMML rather than ""dysplasia-only"" MDS types such as refractory anemia. We report a single-institution experience with splenectomy in CMML patients, including a detailed review of splenic histopathology. Twelve patients with CMML underwent splenectomy at the Mayo Clinic, primarily because of refractory thrombocytopenia and/or mechanical complications related to splenomegaly. Three of the 12 patients (25%) died as a direct result of surgery, and significant postoperative morbidity was seen in another 4 patients (33%). Thrombocytopenia improved in 4 of the 11 patients (36%) with low platelet counts before surgery. Three of the four responders had an abundance of CD68 (PGM1)-positive foamy histiocytes in the marginal zone surrounding the splenic white pulp-a pattern which can be seen in immune thrombocytopenia-and two of these three patients had thrombocytopenia out of proportion to the degree of anemia pre-operatively, suggestive of peripheral destruction of platelets. More consistent splenic pathological findings in the 12 patients included trilineage extramedullary hematopoiesis in splenic red pulp and expansion of splenic cords by a myelomonocytic infiltrate. This study underscores both the uniformity and diversity of splenic findings in CMML, highlights the potential dangers and benefits of splenectomy in this group, and suggests peripheral destruction of platelets as a mechanism contributing to thrombocytopenia in a subset of CMML patients.","['Steensma, David P', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Li, Chin-Yang']","['Steensma DP', 'Tefferi A', 'Li CY']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, West 10, 200 First Street, SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. steensma.david@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Care', 'Spleen/*pathology', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/*pathology/surgery', 'Syndrome', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603000067 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00006-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Sep;27(9):775-82. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00006-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have therefore tested the targeting capability and replicative stability of ecotropic and amphotropic replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) vectors containing two tandem repeats from the immunoglobulin G-binding domain of Staphylococcal protein A inserted into the proline-rich ""hinge"" region of the envelope, which enables modular use of antibodies of various specificities for vector targeting. The modified envelopes were efficiently expressed and incorporated into virions, were capable of capturing monoclonal anti-HER2 antibodies, and mediated efficient binding of the virus-antibody complex to HER2-positive target cells. While infectivity was markedly reduced by pseudotyping with targeted envelopes alone, coexpression of wild-type envelope rescued efficient cellular entry. Both ecotropic and amphotropic RCR vector/anti-HER2 antibody complexes achieved significant enhancement of transduction on murine target cells overexpressing HER2, which could be competed by preincubation with excess free antibodies. Interestingly, HER2-expressing human breast cancer cells did not show enhancement of transduction despite efficient antibody-mediated cell surface binding, suggesting that target cell-specific parameters markedly affect the efficiency of post-binding entry processes. Serial replication of targeted vectors resulted in selection of Z domain deletion variants, but reduction of the overall size of the vector genome enhanced its stability. Application of antibody-mediated targeting to the initial localization of replication-competent virus vectors to tumor sites will thus require optimized target selection and vector design.","['Tai, Chien-Kuo', 'Logg, Christopher R', 'Park, Jinha M', 'Anderson, W French', 'Press, Michael F', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Tai CK', 'Logg CR', 'Park JM', 'Anderson WF', 'Press MF', 'Kasahara N']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, Department of Pathology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Vectors/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/chemistry', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Virion/chemistry', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/12/18 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403765255174 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 May 20;14(8):789-802. doi: 10.1089/104303403765255174.,,,['CA48780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody, AHN-12, recognized the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 expressed on the surface of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and studies showed that it reacted with both CD45-expressing normal peripheral blood cells and leukemia cells from patients. The antibody was readily labeled with (90)Y using the highly stable chelate 1B4M-DTPA and the radioimmunoconjugate was designated (90)Y-anti-CD45. The agent selectively bound to CD45(+) B cell line Daudi, but not CD45(-) control cells and significantly (p = 0.007) more bound to Daudi tumors growing in athymic nude mice than did a control non-reactive antibody. Moreover, biodistribution data correlated well to an anti-Daudi effect observed against established tumors in nude mice. The effect was dose dependent and irreversible with the best results in mice receiving a single dose of 137 microCi (90)Y-anti-CD45. These mice displayed a significantly (p < 0.0095) better anti-tumor effect than a control (90)Y-labeled antibody and survived over 135 days with no evidence of tumor. Histology studies showed no significant injury to kidney, liver, or small intestine even at 254 microCi, the highest dose tested. Because radiolabeled anti-CD45 antibody can be used to deliver radiation selectively to lymphohematopoietic tissue, these data indicate that this agent may be used to improve treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, particularly leukemia and lymphoma, when combined with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a future clinical trial.","['Vallera, D A', 'Elson, M', 'Brechbiel, M W', 'Dusenbery, K E', 'Burns, L J', 'Skubitz, K M', 'Jaszcz, W B', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Kuroki, D W', 'Wagner, J E', 'Kersey, J H']","['Vallera DA', 'Elson M', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Dusenbery KE', 'Burns LJ', 'Skubitz KM', 'Jaszcz WB', 'Ramsay NK', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Kuroki DW', 'Wagner JE', 'Kersey JH']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, Minneapolis 55455, USA. valle001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Indium Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2004/01/13 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/108497803765036300 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2003 Apr;18(2):133-45. doi: 10.1089/108497803765036300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this case report, we present a patient developing the complication of severe hyperglycemia following administration of big ICE because of a relapse of acute myeloblastic leukemia. CASE REPORT: When a 41-year-old woman with acute myeloblastic leukemia in relapse was treated using the big ICE protocol, because of lack of efficacy of other chemotherapy regimens. On the 7th day and 9th day of chemotherapy, glycemia was 13.2 mmol/l and 25.8 mmol/l, respectively. Hyperglycemia was controlled with continuous regular insulin infusion and neutralization of parenteral nutrition solution with regular insulin. After the regulation of the glycemia, regular insulin was injected four times daily. Following days, hematological remission was obtained and requirement of insulin becomes less and glycemia decreased to the normal levels. CONCLUSION: Severe hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus likely due to chemotherapy may develop in patients with acute leukemia. This may have a negative effect on mortality and morbidity.

Thirty-seven adult patients, average 49 years (range 15-74), with acute leukemia were studied during first remission induction chemotherapy. Weight changes were classified into one of four separate groups, ranging from minimal weight changes to > 10 kg loss. The patients were followed until death or complete remission. During the induction period, patients lost (in mean) 5.1 kg body weight, had severe neutropenia (i.e., less than 0.1 x 10(9)/1) and fever for 25-26% of this time. Patients exhibiting moderate weight reduction (i.e., 2-5.9 and 6-9.9 kg; n = 22) were neutropenic and febrile for 23% of the induction period; they displayed the highest remission rates, 90 and 92%, respectively. In contrast, patients in the minimal or maximal weight change groups (i.e. a loss of < 2 kg; n = 8, or > 10 kg; n = 7), showing shortest or longest duration of neutropenia (20% and 36%, respectively) and fever (25% and 42%), had the lowest remission rates, 50 and 63%, respectively. By logistic regression analyses, change of weight and time with fever were associated with remission rates. However, none of these variables were related to remission times. We may conclude that in adult acute leukemia patients a moderate weight loss (together with intermediate duration of neutropenia and fever) was associated with the highest remission rates.","['Cederholm, Tommy', 'Eriksson, Karin', 'Palmblad, Jan']","['Cederholm T', 'Eriksson K', 'Palmblad J']","['Department of Geriatric Medicine, B56, Karolinska Institutet at Huddinge University Hospital, S-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

METHODS: Differentiation was assessed by marker analysis, morphology, immunohistochemistry, proliferation and cellular activity assays. RESULTS: L-C increases HLA-DR and CD14 surface antigens, while morphologic and marker analysis of the treated cells reveals the presence of monocytes, neutrophiles and few dendritic cells. What is important, however, is the induction of cells that have an atypical to this pathway allure staining positive for the neurofilament 3A10 monoclonal antibody, specific for nerve cells and the anti-p75 (Nerve Growth Factor Receptor) monoclonal antibody. The events described concern active and, at the same time, not proliferative senescent cells. CONCLUSIONS: L-C exerts its differentiation action on a certain fraction of the leukemic population yielding a non-negligible number of atypical for the myeloid lineage cells. These findings complement earlier and recent reports that describe the generation of cells of a different lineage irrelevant to their parent line of differentiation indicating that the hemopoietic pool appears to be the source of any kind of cell types according to the stimulus provided. Thus, in the context of the plasticity theory it appears that the HL-60 cell line also possess the potential to differentiate towards unexpected pathways.","['Vassiliadis, S', 'Evangeliou, A', 'Basta, E', 'Dionyssopoulou, E', 'Dimitriou, H', 'Stiakaki, E', 'Kalmanti, M', 'Athanassakis, I']","['Vassiliadis S', 'Evangeliou A', 'Basta E', 'Dionyssopoulou E', 'Dimitriou H', 'Stiakaki E', 'Kalmanti M', 'Athanassakis I']","['Department of Biology, Department of Mother-Child, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. simon@biology.uoc.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)']",IM,"['Carnitine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*pathology']",,2003/06/14 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/06/14 05:00'],"['2003/06/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 2002;32(4):341-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, in spite of adopting treatment protocols based on therapy for childhood ALL, the disease is still curable in 30-40% of patients only. These worse results of therapy may be due to the induction of various cell defence mechanisms, such as activation of P-glycoprotein, which protects man against xenobiotics. Among a number of various multi-drug resistance mechanisms, differences between adults and children with ALL have been found only for higher P-glycoprotein expression and possibly more often p53 gene mutations in adults. Induction of expression of drug resistance proteins during chemotherapy and co-existence of various mechanisms are common phenomena in adult ALL. Differences in resistance to different drugs might contribute to the impact of age on the outcome of ALL.

The cell line, designated TMBL-1, carried a His-175 mutant p53. The immunophenotype of the primary leukemia cells at diagnosis was cytoplasmic CD3+, CD7+, CD13+, CD33-, interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor+ and c-kit -. However, leukemia cells in relapse and TMBL-1 cells were CD33+ and c-kit +. Immunophenotypically, TMBL-1 is a BAL cell line that coexpresses T-lymphoid and myeloid markers which fulfill the criteria of the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemia. Stem cell factor (SCF), a key regulator of hematopoiesis signaling through c-kit, enhanced the proliferation of TMBL-1 cells. Direct sequencing revealed the conversion at codon 175 of the p53 gene in the TMBL-1 cells. Primary leukemia cells in relapse also carried the same point mutation but not at diagnosis.

After 4 days of incubation viable mononuclear myeloid cells were identified by the exclusion of propidium iodide in CD13 or CD33 positive cells. Sixty-eight samples from 64 AML patients were included. In this study, we showed that the flow cytometry method is feasible in AML and we also found some correlations to clinical data. The secondary AML at diagnosis showed an in vitro resistance to etoposide and amsacrine that was significantly higher compared to de novo AML at diagnosis (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02). When AML patients at diagnosis were compared to resistant disease/relapse patients there was a significantly higher effect of ara-C in the diagnosis group (p = 0.03).

The MLL gene rearrangements occur at a high frequency in monoblastic subtype, hyperleukocytosis or young age in infant AML. Compared with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however, it remains unknown whether prenatal origin exists in the pathogenesis of infant AML. Recently, the treatment outcome of infant AML has been clarified by two study groups, which confirmed the effect of intensive chemotherapy including repeated cycles of cytarabine and anthracyclines for infant AML. Presence of the MLL gene rearrangements, gender, age and white blood cell count showed no influence on the outcome of infant AML. The allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the treatment of choice for infant AML when a matched related donor is available. Monitoring of minimal residual disease by real-time PCR is a useful technique to predict the outcome or efficacy of the treatment in infant AML. Although intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic HSCT have cured most AML infants, some still relapse and ultimately die.

Using quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR we compared mRNA synthesis of the above mentioned enzymes in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of 23 healthy persons (mean age 45 years), 9 blood and 22 bone marrow samples of 31 MDS patients with varying proportions of apoptotic cells (mean age 78 years), and blood samples of 30 age-matched controls. In addition, plasma carnitine levels were determined. Compared to younger adults, there was a 50% downregulation of CPT1 in elderly persons and in MDS patients. Reduction in CRAT, CPT 2, and OCTN2 was more than 85%. Reduction in microsomal CPT was more pronounced in MDS patients than in age-matched controls (96% vs. 43%). In MDS bone marrow cells there was a negative correlation of CPT1 and CRAT with the relative proportion of apoptotic cells. Plasma carnitine values were similar in all groups. The described reduction in transcription of different genes in blood cells which is well known in different tissues may reflect a systemic signaling process, associated with aging, apoptosis, and MDS.","['Karlic, Heidrun', 'Lohninger, Alfred', 'Laschan, Claudia', 'Lapin, Alexander', 'Bohmer, Franz', 'Huemer, Marlies', 'Guthann, Elisabeth', 'Rappold, Eduard', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael']","['Karlic H', 'Lohninger A', 'Laschan C', 'Lapin A', 'Bohmer F', 'Huemer M', 'Guthann E', 'Rappold E', 'Pfeilstocker M']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Hanusch Hospital, H.

A majority of these deletions in lymphoid leukemia have been indicated to be mediated by illegitimate V(D)J recombination. In the present study, to elucidate the molecular processes of 9p21 deletions in nonlymphocytic malignancies, breakpoints for these deletions were analysed in 21 lung cancer cell lines and 32 nonlymphocytic cancer cell lines of nine other histological types. In all, 32 breakpoints in 21 lung cancer cell lines and 56 breakpoints in 32 nonlung cancer cell lines were mapped in a 450-kb segment encompassing the CDKN2A locus with a 10-kb resolution. The largest number of breakpoints (i.e., seven breakpoints in lung cancer and 12 breakpoints in nonlung cancers) was mapped in a 10-kb region containing the CDKN2A gene. More precise mapping of these seven and 12 breakpoints revealed that none of these breakpoints were located within 50-bp intervals to each other in this 10 kb region. Cloning and sequencing of breakpoints in 18 representative cell lines (six lung and 12 nonlung cancers) further revealed that there were no significant homologies among breakpoints in these 18 cell lines. In 11 (61%) cell lines, 1-5-bp nucleotides were overlapped at breakpoint junctions. These results indicate that DNA double-strand breaks triggering 9p21 deletions do not occur at specific DNA sequences, although they preferentially occur in or near the CDKN2A locus. It was also indicated that two broken DNA ends are rejoined by nonhomologous end-joining repair, preferentially utilizing microhomologies of DNA ends, in the occurrence of 9p21 deletions.","['Sasaki, Shigeru', 'Kitagawa, Yukiko', 'Sekido, Yoshitaka', 'Minna, John D', 'Kuwano, Hiroyuki', 'Yokota, Jun', 'Kohno, Takashi']","['Sasaki S', 'Kitagawa Y', 'Sekido Y', 'Minna JD', 'Kuwano H', 'Yokota J', 'Kohno T']","['Biology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Damage', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206589 [doi]', '1206589 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jun 12;22(24):3792-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206589.,,,['P50 CA70907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent data support a role of the combination of p53 and telomerase inactivation in initiating genetic instability that promotes malignant transformation. Through its pleiotropic effects on infected T-cell metabolism, the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax plays a central role in leukemogenesis. Here, we show that Tax inhibits human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription, which is the rate-limiting factor of telomerase activity. This inhibitory effect, that occurs in competition with c-Myc through a canonical c-Myc binding site within the hTERT promoter, results in a decreased telomerase activity of Tax-expressing cells. This is the first demonstration of hTERT inhibition by an oncogene. Tax, which is only expressed in preleukemic cells, triggers infected T-cell cycle and keeps these cells cycling while inactivating p53. We propose that, in combination with these effects, hTERT repression by Tax at an early phase of carcinogenesis might contribute to the massive ploidy changes associated with the development of HTLV-1-associated malignancies.","['Gabet, Anne-Sophie', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Charneau, Pierre', 'Riou, Patrice', 'Duc-Dodon, Madeleine', 'Wu, Yalin', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh', 'Wattel, Eric']","['Gabet AS', 'Mortreux F', 'Charneau P', 'Riou P', 'Duc-Dodon M', 'Wu Y', 'Jeang KT', 'Wattel E']","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Virale-CNRS UMR 5537, Centre Leon Berard, 28 rue Laennec, 69373 Lyon cedex 08, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206468 [doi]', '1206468 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jun 12;22(24):3734-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206468.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spatially restricted and temporally dynamic pattern of PLZF expression in the developing CNS suggested that it might play a role in the circuitry regulating hindbrain segmentation. We have now identified a PLZF binding site (PLZF-RE) in an enhancer region of Hoxb2 that itself is required for directing high-level expression in rhombomers 3 and 5 of the developing hindbrain. The wild-type r3/r5 enhancer linked to a heterologous promoter was responsive to regulation by PLZF, and this activity was lost in variants containing a mutated PLZF-RE. Compared with the wild-type protein, the binding of the APL-associated reciprocal RARalpha-PLZF fusion to PLZF-RE was much stronger, suggesting that the N-terminal PLZF sequences missing from the fusion may play a role in the regulation of DNA binding. Consistent with this, the N-terminal POZ domain was required for cooperative binding of PLZF to a multimerized PLZF-RE. In the context of the r3/r5 enhancer, the PLZF-RE cooperated for PLZF binding with an additional A/T-rich motif positioned downstream of the PLZF-RE. This A/T motif was previously shown to be essential for the regulation of Hoxb2 expression in r3 and r5 in cooperation with another Kruppel-like zinc finger protein Krox 20. The presence of both the PLZF-RE and the A/T-rich motif was required for a maximal effect of PLZF on a heterologous promoter and was essential in vivo to direct the expression of a lacZ reporter in the chick neural tube. Hence, both PLZF and Krox20 cooperate with a common A/T motif in mediating in vivo activity of the Hoxb2 enhancer. Our findings indicate that Hoxb2 is a direct target for regulation by PLZF in the developing CNS and suggest that deregulation of Hox gene expression may contribute to APL pathogenesis.","['Ivins, Sarah', 'Pemberton, Kieran', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Howell, Louise', 'Krumlauf, Robb', 'Zelent, Arthur']","['Ivins S', 'Pemberton K', 'Guidez F', 'Howell L', 'Krumlauf R', 'Zelent A']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Rhombencephalon/embryology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*physiology']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206328 [doi]', '1206328 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jun 12;22(24):3685-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206328.,,,['CA59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From 1993 to 1998, 1201 eligible patients 15 to 65 years of age who had newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease in unfavorable stage IIB or IIIA or stage IIIB or IV were randomly assigned to receive eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone alternating with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (COPP-ABVD); bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP); or increased-dose BEACOPP, each followed by local radiotherapy when indicated. Enrollment in the COPP-ABVD group was stopped in 1996 owing to inferior results. RESULTS: For the final analysis, 1195 of 1201 patients could be evaluated: 260 in the COPP-ABVD group, 469 in the BEACOPP group, and 466 in the increased-dose BEACOPP group; the median follow-up was 72, 54, and 51 months, respectively. The rate of freedom from treatment failure at five years was 69 percent in the COPP-ABVD group, 76 percent in the BEACOPP group, and 87 percent in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (P=0.04 for the comparison of the COPP-ABVD group with the BEACOPP group and P<0.001 for the comparison of the increased-dose BEACOPP group with the COPP-ABVD group and with the BEACOPP group), and the five-year rates of overall survival were 83 percent, 88 percent, and 91 percent, respectively (P=0.16 for the comparison of the COPP-ABVD group with the BEACOPP group, P=0.06 for the comparison of the BEACOPP group with the increased-dose BEACOPP group, and P=0.002 for the comparison of the COPP-ABVD group with the increased-dose BEACOPP group).

This new approach promises to give better therapeutic measurements to cancer patients by diagnosing cancer types with improved accuracy. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the classification methods successfully applied to the cancer diagnosis problems. However, its optimal extension to more than two classes was not obvious, which might impose limitations in its application to multiple tumor types. We briefly introduce the Multicategory SVM, which is a recently proposed extension of the binary SVM, and apply it to multiclass cancer diagnosis problems. RESULTS: Its applicability is demonstrated on the leukemia data (Golub et al., 1999) and the small round blue cell tumors of childhood data (Khan et al., 2001). Comparable classification accuracy shown in the applications and its flexibility render the MSVM a viable alternative to other classification methods.

We show how an information geometric measure achieves this.

In particular, we propose an iterative procedure by using this measure (called IPIG). The procedure finds higher-order dependencies which may underlie the interaction between two genes of interest. To demonstrate the method, we investigate the interaction between the two genes of interest in the data from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The method successfully discovered biologically known findings and also selected other genes as hidden causes that constitute the interaction.

Its first stage involves compression of dimensions that can be achieved by applying SVD to the gene-sample matrix in microarray problems. Thus the data (samples or genes) can be represented by vectors in a truncated space of low dimensionality, 4 and 5 in the examples studied here. We find it preferable to project all vectors onto the unit sphere before applying a clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm used here is the quantum clustering method that has one free scale parameter. Although the method is not hierarchical, it can be modified to allow hierarchy in terms of this scale parameter. RESULTS: We apply our method to three data sets. The results are very promising. On cancer cell data we obtain a dendrogram that reflects correct groupings of cells. In an AML/ALL data set we obtain very good clustering of samples into four classes of the data. Finally, in clustering of genes in yeast cell cycle data we obtain four groups in a problem that is estimated to contain five families.

The high-dimensional gene expression data can be used to study similarities of gene expression profiles across different samples to form a gene clustering. The clusters may be indicative of genetic pathways. Parallel to gene clustering is the important application of sample classification based on all or selected gene expressions. The gene clustering and sample classification are often undertaken separately, or in a directional manner (one as an aid for the other). However, such separation of these two tasks may occlude informative structure in the data. Here we present an algorithm for the simultaneous clustering of genes and subset selection of gene clusters for sample classification. We develop a new model selection criterion based on Rissanen's MDL (minimum description length) principle. For the first time, an MDL code length is given for both explanatory variables (genes) and response variables (sample class labels). The final output of the proposed algorithm is a sparse and interpretable classification rule based on cluster centroids or the closest genes to the centroids. RESULTS: Our algorithm for simultaneous gene clustering and subset selection for classification is applied to three publicly available data sets. For all three data sets, we obtain sparse and interpretable classification models based on centroids of clusters. At the same time, these models give competitive test error rates as the best reported methods. Compared with classification models based on single gene selections, our rules are stable in the sense that the number of clusters has a small variability and the centroids of the clusters are well correlated (or consistent) across different cross validation samples. We also discuss models where the centroids of clusters are replaced with the genes closest to the centroids. These models show comparable test error rates to models based on single gene selection, but are more sparse as well as more stable. Moreover, we comment on how the inclusion of a classification criterion affects the gene clustering, bringing out class informative structure in the data.

An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. RESULTS: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observations.

Various parametric tests, such as the two-sample t-test, have been used, but their possibly too strong parametric assumptions or large sample justifications may not hold in practice. As alternatives, a class of three nonparametric statistical methods, including the empirical Bayes method of Efron et al. (2001), the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) method of Tusher et al. (2001) and the mixture model method (MMM) of Pan et al. (2001), have been proposed. All the three methods depend on constructing a test statistic and a so-called null statistic such that the null statistic's distribution can be used to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. However, relatively little effort has been directed toward assessment of the performance or the underlying assumptions of the methods in constructing such test and null statistics. RESULTS: We point out a problem of a current method to construct the test and null statistics, which may lead to largely inflated Type I errors (i.e. false positives). We also propose two modifications that overcome the problem. In the context of MMM, the improved performance of the modified methods is demonstrated using simulated data. In addition, our numerical results also provide evidence to support the utility and effectiveness of MMM.","['Zhao, Yanli', 'Pan, Wei']","['Zhao Y', 'Pan W']","['Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, MMC 303, A460 Mayo Building, 420 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2004/03/18 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/btf879 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2003 Jun 12;19(9):1046-54. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btf879.,,,['R01-HL65462/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to determine LTB gene expression in different hematologic neoplasias. DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the expression of LTB using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a series of RNA samples from CD3(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells isolated from peripheral blood (n=7); CD19(+) B cells isolated from lymph nodes (n=11) and from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n=16), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=43), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n=12), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n=19), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n=32) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL; n=22). RESULTS: The expression level of LTB in CD3(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells isolated from blood was ten to forty times lower than that in normal CD19(+) B cells isolated from lymph nodes. In malignant myeloid cells the expression levels were very low, whereas in malignant lymphoid cells the expression was higher than in myeloid cells, being highest in MCL and CLL (20.2+/-14.0 ng/microL and 81.0+/-116.3 ng/microL) and low in SLL (4.5+/-3.6 ng/microL; p=0.001). We did not find correlations between LTB expression and hematoclinical parameters (risk groups, immunophenotypes and overall survival). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A distinct difference in expression of LTB in CLL and SLL indicates that these morphologically similar B-cell malignancies are molecularly different. Further studies are needed to investigate the prognostic value of LTB and any role that LTB may have in determining whether the malignant B cells manifest a leukemia or lymphoma.","['Nagy, Balint', 'Ferrer, Anna', 'Larramendy, Marcelo L', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Aalto, Yan', 'Casas, Silvia', 'Vilpo, Juhani', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Franssila, Kaarle', 'Knuutila, Sakari']","['Nagy B', 'Ferrer A', 'Larramendy ML', 'Galimberti S', 'Aalto Y', 'Casas S', 'Vilpo J', 'Ruutu T', 'Vettenranta K', 'Franssila K', 'Knuutila S']","['Departments of Pathology and Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute and Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (LTB protein, human)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-beta)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-beta', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2004/01/30 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jun;88(6):654-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present analysis aimed at improving the applicability of this approach to more patients with AML. DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from unselected patients with AML at diagnosis and from healthy volunteers were immunophenotyped applying triple-stainings of 31 antigens. Leukemia-associated immunophenotypes were defined by gating on populations displaying an aberrant or infrequent immunophenotype and by applying Boolean algebra. The combination of gates obtained was applied to list mode data files containing measurements of normal bone marrow samples. Dilution experiments of AML samples in normal bone marrow were performed to test the linearity of measurements. RESULTS: At least one aberrant/infrequent immunophenotype was identified (median, 2; range, 1-5) in all of 68 analyzed AML patients. The median frequencies of cells displaying an aberrant/infrequent immunophenotype within normal bone marrow ranged from 0.00% to 1.20% (median, 0.07%). Limiting this analysis to only the most sensitive aberrant/infrequent immunophenotype per patient resulted in frequencies of cells displaying an aberrant/infrequent immunophenotype within normal bone marrow ranging from 0.00% to 0.43% (median, 0.05%). Serial dilution experiments confirmed the linearity of measurements (R>0.90 in all cases analyzed). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The application of multiparameter flow cytometry to identify cells displaying an aberrant/infrequent immunophenotype and to quantify MRD is feasible in unselected patients with AML.","['Kern, Wolfgang', 'Danhauser-Riedl, Susanne', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kern W', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Ratei R', 'Schnittger S', 'Schoch C', 'Kolb HJ', 'Ludwig WD', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, University Hospital Grosshadern, Dept. of Internal Medicine III, Muenchen, Germany wolfgang.kern@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells/classification', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2004/01/30 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jun;88(6):646-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and fifty-six adult patients with AML were included in the study. FLT3/ITD was detected in 41 (26%) patients (FLT3/ITD(+)). DESIGN AND METHODS: The main differences observed between the groups with and without FLT3/ITD: a higher leukocyte count, a raised percentage of a normal karyotype and a more frequent M5 FAB diagnosis in the FLT3/ITD(+) patients. As regards the immunophenotype characteristics the FLT3/ITD(+) group very often expressed monocytic markers (CD36 and CD11b) and less commonly immature markers (CD34 and CD117). A promyelocytic-like immunophenotype pattern was also detected in a minority of these patients(4/36). RESULTS: The FLT3/ITD(+) patients had a shorter overall survival, a shorter event-free survival and a higher probability of relapse. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was investigated in the FLT3/ITD(+) patients using flow cytometry. This technique had a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 83% in relapse prediction. Minimal residual disease analysis was hampered by the low number of patients with detectable aberrant immunophenotype. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of changes in the phenotype and/or genotype pattern between diagnosis and relapse was detected (5/6). FLT3/ITD is a frequent molecular lesion in de novo adult AML and seems to be associated with a monocytic differentiation, a high leukocyte count and a poor prognosis. Immunophenotype and genotype patterns observed at relapse suggest that the FLT3/ITD(+) blasts may be genetically unstable and prone to clonal evolution. FLT3/ITD may not be a suitable target for minimal residual disease studies.","['Munoz, Luz', 'Aventin, Ana', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Junca, Jordi', 'Acebedo, Gemma', 'Domingo, Alicia', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Torres, J Pio', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F']","['Munoz L', 'Aventin A', 'Villamor N', 'Junca J', 'Acebedo G', 'Domingo A', 'Rozman M', 'Torres JP', 'Tormo M', 'Nomdedeu JF']","[""Laboratori d'Hematologia, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2004/01/30 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jun;88(6):637-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its influence on disease progression to blast crisis is marginal and mostly due to its effect of impairing the genomic stability of clonal myeloid progenitors through pathways still largely unknown. DESIGN AND METHODS: To elucidate the role of p53 in CML progression we generated, from the 32D murine myeloid cell line, several clones co-expressing the E6 product gene of human papilloma virus (HPV) 16, which abrogates p53 function, and a temperature-sensitive bcr-abl construct encoding a fully active p210 protein only at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C. RESULTS: Co-expression of the two proteins resulted in a significant enlargement of the G(2)/M phase of cell cycle and in the appearance of a poly-aneuploid cell population. Furthermore, with continuous in vitro passages the p210 tyrosine kinase became dispensable for growth. Increased levels of cyclin B(1) and enhanced activity of its associated cyclin-dependent kinase (cdc2) became apparent during the clonal evolution of p210 bcr-abl-transduced 32D cell clones lacking p53. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The acceleration of clonal evolution of p210 bcr-abl-transduced 32D myeloid progenitors associated with p53 functional abrogation is consistent with oncosuppressor loss having a key role in CML progression. This would allow emergence of additional genomic aberrations which would lead to the fully transformed phenotype of blast crisis. Deregulated activity of the cyclin B1-cdc2 complex may be involved in the loss of temporal co-ordination of mitotic events and further free the barrier to genomic instability of CML clonal myeloid progenitors lacking p53.","['Brusa, Gianluca', 'Benvenuti, Michela', 'Mazzacurati, Lucia', 'Mancini, Manuela', 'Pattacini, Laura', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Greenberger, Joel S', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra']","['Brusa G', 'Benvenuti M', 'Mazzacurati L', 'Mancini M', 'Pattacini L', 'Martinelli G', 'Barbieri E', 'Greenberger JS', 'Baccarani M', 'Santucci MA']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica ""Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli"", University of Bologna Medical School, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', '*Ploidies', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2004/01/30 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jun;88(6):622-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observation of a strong and unusual expression of LRP in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monocytic component led us to test (for P170 and LRP) a new series of 47 AML with different FAB subtypes. The expression of LRP was scored from 1 to 5 in blast cells and monocytes separately. We demonstrate that LRP is not correlated with clinical outcome but is statistically related to monoblastic leukemias. Code 5 reaction was found in 10/13 M5 versus the other FAB subtypes (P<10(-3)). The strongest LRP overexpression was also found in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (four cases), reactive monocytosis (three cases) and in a dendritic cell line.

However, it can induce cytogenetical remissions in a very small percentage of the patients. Also during interferon therapy, resistance can emerge in the CML clones. K562 is an in vitro model cell line transformed from a Ph positive CML patient. It can be induced to differentiate to granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages with certain molecules. IFN-alpha-2b generally exerts its effects on CML cells by Janus family kinases (Jak/Stat) pathway, mostly through tyrosine kinase system. However, there is almost no data on the relevance of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein phosphatase (PP) system in the interferon induced signal transduction pathways. In this study, we investigated serine/threonine protein phosphatases in the IFN-alpha-2b induced K562 cytotoxicity. Trypan blue dye exclusion test and MTT assay were utilised for determining cytotoxicity. IC(50) of IFN-alpha-2b on K562 cells was found to be 600IU/ml. However, no differentiation was determined by analysis of cell surface antigen expressions. Serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A (Cal A) and okadaic acid (OKA) augmented the IFN-alpha-2b induced cytotoxicity. Apoptosis assay by the mono-oligonucleosome detection and acridine orange/propidium iodide dye revealed marked apoptosis underlying cytotoxicity. Phosphatase enzyme assay revealed a gradual increase in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity during interferon induced cytotoxicity. Conversely, immunoblots showed no change in the expression of PP2A catalytic and regulatory subunits. In conclusion, PP2A plays a role in IFN-alpha-2b induced apoptosis of K562 cells and should be investigated as a new window furthermore.","['Saydam, Guray', 'Aydin, Hikmet Hakan', 'Sahin, Fahri', 'Selvi, Nur', 'Oktem, Gulperi', 'Terzioglu, Ender', 'Buyukkececi, Filiz', 'Omay, Serdar Bedii']","['Saydam G', 'Aydin HH', 'Sahin F', 'Selvi N', 'Oktem G', 'Terzioglu E', 'Buyukkececi F', 'Omay SB']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Subunits/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602003478 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00347-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Aug;27(8):709-17. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00347-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within a given microenvironment, the angiogenic response is regulated by a delicate balance of angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a multifunctional extracellular glycoprotein showing angiostatic properties in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays. Interestingly, there is also proangiogenic domain in this complex molecule. Development of TSP-1 as an antiangiogenic drug has been hindered by multiplicity of its functional effects, difficulties in its production and its poor pharmacokinetics. The aim of the present study was to establish a recombinant adenovirus (ADV.TSP-1(f)) expressing antiangiogenic fragment of TSP-1 (TSP-1(f)), and to determine the feasibility for use of the adenovirally expressed TSP-1(f) in leukemia gene therapy. The results of this investigation showed that TSP-1(f) was expressed efficiently in adenovirus-transduced human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Compared to the controls, although there was almost no effect on proliferation of K562 cells in vitro, adenovirus-mediated TSP-1(f) transduction inhibited the growth of K562 xenografts dramatically. Furthermore, the microvessel density (MVD) was much lower in the ADV.TSP-1(f)-treated tumors compared to the controls.

Polyethylenimine (PEI) prolonged prothrombin time, demonstrating its anticoagulant potential. In vitro, PEI at low concentration (nM) significantly blocked thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation, accounting for its mode of anticoagulation. The uncompetitive inhibition by PEI of fibrin formation was independent of the concentration of fibrinogen (FBG), thrombin, or NaCl. PEI showed no effect on thrombin amidolytic activity, suggesting that the blockade of thrombin interaction with FBG could account for the inhibition on fibrin formation. PEI drastically depressed rabbit brain thromboplastin procoagulation monitored by a single-stage clotting assay using human plasma. In a THP-1 monocytic hypercoagulation model, a 4-h exposure to bacterial endotoxin or Ca(2+) ionophore A23187, respectively, resulted in a 5- or 10-fold enhancement in monocytic tissue factor (mTF) procoagulation. mTF hypercoagulation was offset by PEI included in the assay mixture. PEI showed the potential to arrest mTF hypercoagulation with IC(50) around 1.2 nM. Using a chromogenic assay to dissect the extrinsic pathway, we further assessed whether PEI has any effect on other clotting factors. PEI was not an inhibitor for either FVIIa or FXa, having no effect on not only the amidolytic but also their corresponding functionally catalytic activities. Although PEI upregulated TF-dependent FVII activation under the low-salt condition, the effective downstream inhibition of fibrin formation readily abolished and overrode the upstream enhancement, demonstrating the overall anticoagulation. PEI could present a new class of anticoagulant.","['Chu, Arthur J', 'Beydoun, Salwa', 'Mathews, Suresh T', 'Hoang, Julie']","['Chu AJ', 'Beydoun S', 'Mathews ST', 'Hoang J']","['Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, University Health Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. ajchu91@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis/metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Fibrin/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polyethyleneimine/*pharmacology', 'Thrombin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0003986103002169 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-9861(03)00216-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2003 Jul 1;415(1):101-8. doi: 10.1016/s0003-9861(03)00216-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment results from a series of 32 patients managed with a therapeutic program based on the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (CTX). METHODS: Thirty-two patients (median age 63 yr, range 42-75 yr) with newly diagnosed (47%) or refractory-relapsed (53%) CLL were programmed to receive six courses of a 3-d combination of fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/d plus CTX at 300 mg/m2/d. Refractory-relapsed patients had previously received different chemotherapy lines from 1 to 5. RESULTS: Fourteen of 32 (44%) patients achieved a complete remission, 16 (50%) obtained partial remission and two (6%) failed to respond. The CR rate was higher in untreated patients; in particular, CR was achieved in nine of 15 (60%) newly diagnosed cases as opposed to five of 17 (29%) among pretreated patients. Toxicity was caused by myelosuppression and/or infections in most cases. After a median follow-up of 24 months (range 8-48 months), 20 of 32 patients (62%) are alive, and 14 of 32 (44%) are free from progression. Median overall survival and median time to progression were 35 and 25 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of fludarabine with CTX is effective in advanced CLL with acceptable toxicity, either as first-line therapy or in refractory-relapsed patients. In particular, a considerable rate of complete remission can be achieved in untreated patients. Myelosuppression represents the major side-effect.","['Schiavone, Ettore Mariano', 'De Simone, Mariacarla', 'Palmieri, Salvatore', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Pocali, Barbara', 'Copia, Carolina', ""D'Amico, Maria Rosaria"", 'Vecchio, Luigi Del', 'Ferrara, Felicetto']","['Schiavone EM', 'De Simone M', 'Palmieri S', 'Annunziata M', 'Pocali B', 'Copia C', ""D'Amico MR"", 'Vecchio LD', 'Ferrara F']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Blood Transfusion Service, A.O.R.N.

METHODS: We screened our institution's electronic database from 1975 onwards, and identified four such cases. Clinical data and bone marrow pathology were carefully reviewed for these patients. RESULTS: Two patients had prominent manifestations of basophil mediator-release and another presented with pituitary dysfunction. Bone marrow examination uniformly revealed trilineage hyperplasia with basophilia and eosinophilia, dysplastic megakaryocytic hyperplasia, and the absence of megakaryocyte clustering. An abnormal pattern of atypical mast cells was noted in two cases. While disease palliation was effectively achieved with hydroxyurea for one patient, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia was eventually observed in this case. Another patient has achieved long-term disease-free survival after undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations reveal a striking pathologic similarity among all four cases, and suggest this disease, which may be aggressive with the potential to transform into acute leukemia, to possibly represent a distinct clinico-pathologic entity (chronic basophilic leukemia).","['Pardanani, Animesh D', 'Morice, William G', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Pardanani AD', 'Morice WG', 'Hoyer JD', 'Tefferi A']","['Divisions of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Basophils/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*classification/diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*classification/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['086 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00086.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Jul;71(1):18-22. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00086.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The endothelial cell proliferation and microvessel formation are regulated by a wide range of soluble mediators, including angiogenin, angiopoietin-2, basic fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-D, angiostatin and endostatin. In the present study, it has been investigated whether these mediators have an additional direct effect on the proliferation and cytokine release by native human AML blasts. AML cells derived from a large group of consecutive patients were investigated. All these mediators could alter the proliferation and cytokine release [interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL6, IL8, tumor necrosis factor alpha] for a minority of patients. Alteration of spontaneous proliferation by at least one mediator was detected in five of 38 patients; whereas, altered cytokine (Flt3-ligand, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor)-dependant proliferation was observed for 10 patients. Growth enhancement was most frequently observed, whereas growth inhibition was uncommon. The effects on AML blast proliferation were often dependant on or were modulated by the presence of the three hematopoietic growth factors. Based on the present results, it is concluded that angioregulatory mediators have additional growth-enhancing effects directly on the AML blasts for certain patients. However, based on the results from this investigation and previous studies it is suggested that their major contribution to the pathogenesis of AML is through their effects on regulation of bone marrow angiogenesis, and future studies of these mediators in AML should probably focus on these effects.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Glenjen, Nils', 'Ryningen, Anita']","['Bruserud O', 'Glenjen N', 'Ryningen A']","['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, and The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/analysis/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['080 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00080.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Jul;71(1):9-17. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00080.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression, of multidrug-resistance (MDR) associated proteins (PGP, LRP, MRP1) was also analyzed. There were 12 males and 24 females (median age 37 yr), 89% (32 of 36) with classic morphology, and 11% (four of 36) with a microgranular variant. Risk class (according to GIMEMA/PETHEMA): 25% (nine of 36) high risk (HR), 53% (nineteen of 36) intermediate risk (IR), 22% (eight of 36) low risk (LR). PGP, LRP, and MRP1 expression at onset and at first relapse was low. CD33 antigen expression was high in all cases. The patients were treated according to GIMEMA protocols (LAP0389 and AIDA) including ATRA in induction in 75% (27 of 36) of cases and 94% (34 of 36) achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction therapy while 6% (two of 36) died early (DDI) of hemorrhage. OUTCOME: 71% (24 of 34) of evaluable patients remain in CR at a median follow-up of 57 months (range 4-158 months) while 29% (10 of 34) relapsed at a median time of 12 months (range 8-43 months) and, of them, eight of 10 died early. The majority of patients that relapsed were in high-risk group. The overall survival (OS) of the whole population at 32 months was 66% and the DFS at 42 months was 62%. A statistically significant difference in terms of DFS was observed between HR and IR/LR patients (P = 0.04 by log-rank). DFS was not affected by age, sex, Hb levels, karyotype, and BCR isoform. At conclusion, our data confirm that despite the high rate of success with ATRA plus chemotherapy as induction (more than 90% of CR), about 30% of APL patients have a relapse (without a long-lasting second remission) and underline the importance of patient stratification in distinct risk groups at diagnosis in order to better adapt the type and intensity of treatment (risk-adapted therapy). Taking into account the high expression of CD33 and the low expression of MDR proteins in APL, new and investigational approaches like gemtuzumab-ozogamicin, with or without ATRA and other new drugs, should be strongly considered expecially in HR APL.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Masolini, Paola', 'Michieli, Mariagrazia', 'Michelutti, Teresa', 'Geromin, Antonella', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Candoni A', 'Damiani D', 'Michelutti A', 'Masolini P', 'Michieli M', 'Michelutti T', 'Geromin A', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medical and Morphological Researches, University Hospital, Udine, Italy. candoni.a@tiscali.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",,2003/06/13 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/13 05:00'],"['2003/06/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['084 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00084.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Jul;71(1):1-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00084.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antileukemic effects after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation for myeloid leukemias are observed and might be related to the recognition of LAAs. Using the serological screening of an expression library (SEREX) of K562 cells, we identified 16 different clones encoding LAAs eliciting a humoral immune response, among them the heat shock proteins HSJ2 and HSP70, the M-phase phosphoprotein 11 (MPP11), the BRCA1-associated protein (BRAP), the Jkappa recombination binding protein (RBPJkappa) and the receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility (RHAMM). Serological responses to MPP11 were observed in 7/19 (37%) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 6/16 (38%) of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but not in healthy volunteers (0/20). IgG antibodies directed against MPP11 were also detected in 25-50% of the sera of patients with solid tumors such as melanoma, renal cell, ovarian and breast carcinoma. mRNA expression of MPP11 was detected in 20/20 AML patients and 7/10 patients with CML. In normal tissues, strong mRNA expression of MPP11 was only detected in testis. By real-time PCR, we detected upregulation of MPP11 in leukemic blasts. Simultaneous humoral immune responses to 2 or more of the 16 LAAs identified here was observed, suggesting the feasibility of a polyvalent vaccination as an option for immunotherapies in leukemia patients.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Taniguchi, Masanori', 'Hauser, Thomas', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Greiner J', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Taniguchi M', 'Hauser T', 'Schmitt A', 'Dohner H', 'Schmitt M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNAJC2 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/secondary']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11200 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Aug 20;106(2):224-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11200.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the leukemic cells between the two twins by karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization identifies a common or shared stem line and extensive subclonal diversity for which the twins' leukemic populations are divergent.

Total RNA from 90 adult patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 25) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 65) was extracted at diagnosis and high density oligonucleotide microarrays were used to analyze the expression profiles of 12,000/22,000 genes in all specimens (Affymetrix U95Av2/U133A). All cases were thoroughly characterized by individual combinations of cytomorphology, cytogenetics, multiparameter immunophenotyping, and molecular genetics. The expression signature of a small set of differentially expressed genes was sufficient to accurately discriminate eight clinically relevant acute leukemia subgroups.

We used molecular cytogenetic techniques to determine the structure of complex chromosome markers in 10 CML-derived cell lines after our investigations of CML patients in blast crisis. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization identified a multitude of structural chromosome aberrations. In addition, genomic gains identified by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) were mapped to highly complex marker chromosomes in more than one cell line. The most common genomic loss detected by CGH affected chromosome 9, whereas the most common genomic gains affected, in order of frequency, the sequences of 8q, 6, and 13q. The smallest discrete amplification on 8q was identified in cell line MEG-01.

OBJECTIVE: LIF and its corresponding receptors gp130 and LIF receptor-alpha (LIFR-alpha) were studied in lymphoid tissue (LT) to reveal potential systemic immunoregulatory effects during the course of HIV-1 infection. METHODS: LIF, gp130, LIFR-alpha and HIV-1 replicating cells were identified at the single cell level by immunohistochemistry and quantified by computerized in situ imaging in tonsil and lymph nodes biopsies (LT) from patients with primary HIV-1 infection (PHI), chronic HIV-1 infection (cHI), long-term non-progressors (LTNP) and HIV-1 seronegative controls. RESULTS: LIF and its receptors, gp130 and LIFR-alpha were significantly (P < 0.005) upregulated in LT from PHI patients as compared with HIV-1 seronegative controls. Expression of LIF in cHI was comparable to LIF levels in HIV-1 seronegative controls whereas LTNP showed significantly reduced LIF expression (P < 0.05). LIF receptors, gp130 and LIFR-alpha were significantly upregulated in cHI (P < 0.005) but downregulated in LTNP (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively). LIF expressing cells could be demonstrated in LT 2 days after onset of acute retroviral syndrome. LIF expression was evident in CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells. Furthermore, high plasma viral load was associated with high expression of LIF in LT. Finally, no HIV-1 replication could be found in CD4 gp130-positive cells in PHI. CONCLUSIONS: LIF, gp130 and LIFR-alpha showed increased expression in LT from patients with PHI. Furthermore, HIV-1 replication did not occur in cells expressing the LIF signaling receptor, gp130, indicating that LIF may be associated with control of HIV-1 replicating cells in vivo.","['Tjernlund, Annelie', 'Fleener, Zareefa', 'Behbahani, Homira', 'Connick, Elizabeth', 'Sonnerborg, Anders', 'Brostrom, Christina', 'Goh, Li-Ean', 'Spetz, Anna-Lena', 'Patterson, Bruce K', 'Andersson, Jan']","['Tjernlund A', 'Fleener Z', 'Behbahani H', 'Connick E', 'Sonnerborg A', 'Brostrom C', 'Goh LE', 'Spetz AL', 'Patterson BK', 'Andersson J']","['Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '42013-48-9 (2-phenyl-5,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,4-oxazine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'HIV Core Protein p24', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', '*HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/*metabolism', '*Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/08/13 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-200306130-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 2003 Jun 13;17(9):1303-10. doi: 10.1097/00002030-200306130-00004.,,,"['AI 41536/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29AI-42499/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01A1-41536/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression studies have identified a relatively small number of genes that are differentially expressed between these subsets, allowing for focused attention on proteins that might contribute to the noted differences in clinical behavior.

In some recent clinical trials, the outcome of ""high-risk"" patients has approached that of ""lower risk"" patients, suggesting that currently applied clinical factors, such as age and presenting leukocyte count, no longer identify the 20% of newly diagnosed patients who ultimately will relapse. Additionally, therapy remains nonspecific, toxic, and sometimes lethal.

Depending on the chromosomal location of provirus integration within the genome, HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-mediated transcription may vary from 0- to 70-fold. Cis-elements such as topoisomerase II cleavage sites, Alu repeats and matrix attachment regions (MARs) are thought to be targets for retroviral integration. Here we show that a novel MAR sequence from the T-cell receptor beta locus (MARbeta) and the IgH MAR mediate transcriptional augmentation when placed upstream of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. The effect of transcriptional augmentation is seen in both transient and stable transfection, indicating its effect even upon integration in the genome. MAR-mediated transcriptional elevation is independent of Tat, and occurs synergistically in the presence of Tat. Further, we show that MAR-mediated transcriptional elevation is specific to the HIV-1 LTR and the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR promoter. In a transient transfection assay using over-expressed IkappaB, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, we show that MAR-induced processive transcription is NF-kappaB dependent, signifying the role of local enhancers within the LTR promoter. Furthermore, by RNase protection experiments using proximal and distal probes, we show that MAR-mediated transcriptional upregulation is more prominent at the distal rather than the proximal end, thus indicating the potential role of MARs in promoting elongation.","['Rampalli, Shravanti', 'Kulkarni, Asavari', 'Kumar, Pavan', 'Mogare, Devraj', 'Galande, Sanjeev', 'Mitra, Debashis', 'Chattopadhyay, Samit']","['Rampalli S', 'Kulkarni A', 'Kumar P', 'Mogare D', 'Galande S', 'Mitra D', 'Chattopadhyay S']","['National Center for Cell Science, Pune University Campus, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411007, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tat/physiology', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Nuclear Matrix/metabolism', 'Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Virus Integration', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkg410 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jun 15;31(12):3248-56. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkg410.,,,,,,,,,PMC162244,,,,,,,

We observed impaired recovery of B lymphocytes and decreased self-renewal in recipients of old Rh(low) cells compared to young Rh(low) cells. Blockade of Rh efflux using verapamil improved lymphoid reconstitution by enriched HSCs, and isolation of aged HSCs based on efflux of a fluorescent multi-drug resistance (MDR) substrate (Bodipy-verapamil) resulted in enrichment of HSC activity equivalent to that obtained with Rh. These observations suggest a complex relationship between MDR activity and HSC function during aging. To address whether the difference between young and aged donors was intrinsic to the HSC compartment or was due to a shift in HSC phenotype, we co-transplanted normal BM derived from young or old donors and followed repopulation simultaneously in the same recipient animals. In a parallel experiment, we co-transplanted HSCs purified from old donors with BM derived from young donors. In both experiments, transplants were given to both young and old recipients. The results show a clear defect in B-cell engraftment from either BM or HSCs of old donors, irrespective of the age of the recipient. In contrast, myeloid engraftment was predominantly derived from BM or HSCs derived from aged donors, again irrespective of recipient age. These data suggest a stem cell basis for B-cell immuno-senescence and the increased incidence of myelocytic leukemia in elderly people.","['Kim, Mijung', 'Moon, Hee-Bom', 'Spangrude, Gerald J']","['Kim M', 'Moon HB', 'Spangrude GJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,['CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Time Factors', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03247.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 May;996:195-208. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03247.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have employed a number of hematopoietic regulatory genes to probe the nature and developmental potential of ES-derived blood precursors. The chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR/ABL oncoprotein transforms a novel class of ES-derived embryonic hematopoietic stem cell that represents a common progenitor of primitive erythropoiesis and definitive lymphoid-myeloid blood development. Expression of the homeobox gene HoxB4 generated normal, non-leukemic hematopoietic progenitors that enabled long-term, multilineage hematopoietic engraftment in primary and secondary mouse recipients. We have used these repopulating hematopoietic stem cells to model therapeutic transplantation from ES cells. We treated an immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) mouse by therapeutic cloning, that is, isogenic ES cell generation by somatic cell nuclear transfer, gene correction, and cell replacement therapy.

The CD45 antigen is present on all cells of the hematopoietic lineage, and using a murine model, we determined whether a lytic CD45 monoclonal antibody could produce persistent aplasia and whether it could facilitate syngeneic or allogeneic stem cell engraftment. After its systemic administration, we found that all leukocyte subsets in peripheral blood were markedly diminished, but only the effect on the lymphoid compartment was sustained and marrow progenitor cells were spared from destruction. Given the transient effects of the monoclonal antibody on myelopoiesis and the more persistent effects on lymphopoiesis, we asked whether this agent could contribute to donor hemopoietic engraftment after subablative transplantation. Treatment with anti-CD45 alone did not enhance syngeneic engraftment, consistent with its inability to destroy progenitor cells and permit competitive repopulation with syngeneic donor stem cells. By contrast, the combination of anti-CD45 and an otherwise inactive dose of total-body irradiation allowed engraftment of H2 fully allogeneic donor stem cells. We attribute this result to the recipient immunosuppression produced by depletion of CD45-positive lymphocytes. We next assessed a pair of unconjugated rat anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), YTH54.12 and YTH25.4, in a clinical trial in patients who were to receive stem cell transplantation for acute leukemia. The maximum tolerated dose of these MAbs, 400 microg/kg/day, produced a pattern of response identical to that seen in the mice, with marked reductions in circulating lymphoid and myeloid cells and sparing of early marrow progenitors. In two of three patients with active leukemia, the MAbs also produced a decrease in the percentage of leukemic blast cells in bone marrow. These pre-clinical and clinical results warrant further evaluation of anti-CD45 MAbs in subablative preparative regimens for stem cell transplantation.","['Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Wulf, Gerald G', 'Rill, Donna R', 'Luo, Kang-Li', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Mei, Zuyoung', 'Kuehnle, Ingrid', 'Brown, Michael P', 'Pule, Martin', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Krance, Robert A']","['Brenner MK', 'Wulf GG', 'Rill DR', 'Luo KL', 'Goodell MA', 'Mei Z', 'Kuehnle I', 'Brown MP', 'Pule M', 'Heslop HE', 'Krance RA']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. mbrenner@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Complement Activation/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03236.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 May;996:80-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03236.x.,,,"['R01 CA81179-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA82101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In somatic cells, telomere repeats are lost with each cell division, eventually leading to genetic instability and cellular senescence. In previous studies, we described substantial and disease stage-specific telomere shortening in peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here, we sought to determine whether age-adjusted telomere length in PB granulocytes (deltaTEL(gran)) is associated with response to treatment with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. A total of 517 samples from 206 patients in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blast crisis (BC) before and up to 706 days after initiation of imatinib therapy (median: 144 days) were analyzed by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of interphase cells in suspension (Flow-FISH); telomere fluorescence was expressed in molecular equivalents of soluble fluorochrome units (MESF). Telomere length in samples from start of treatment up to day 144 was significantly shorter (mean +/- SE; -1.5 +/- 0.3 kMESF) compared to samples from patients treated for more than 144 days (-0.8 +/- 0.3 kMESF, p = 0.035). In patients with repeated measurements, a significant increase in telomere length under treatment was observed. Median telomere length in major remission was found to be significantly longer compared to patients without response to treatment measured either by cytogenetics (n = 246, p < 0.05), interphase FISH (n = 204, p = 0.002), or quantitative RT-PCR (n = 371, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the increase in telomere length under treatment with imatinib reflects a shift from Ph+ to Ph- cells in the PB of patients with CML.","['Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Ersoz, Inci', 'Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Wolke, Holger', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Lahaye, Tanja', 'Berner, Birgit', 'Bartolovic, Kerol', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Berger, Ute', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Dietz, Klaus', 'Lansdorp, Peter M', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Brummendorf TH', 'Ersoz I', 'Hartmann U', 'Balabanov S', 'Wolke H', 'Paschka P', 'Lahaye T', 'Berner B', 'Bartolovic K', 'Kreil S', 'Berger U', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Hehlmann R', 'Dietz K', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Kanz L', 'Hochhaus A']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Tubingen, Germany. tim.bruemmendorf@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*drug effects/*pathology']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03229.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 May;996:26-38. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03229.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cb2 is a 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which is normally expressed on B lymphocytes. Using transwell assays we observed strong migration of Cb2-expressing cells upon stimulation with 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), a potent endocannabinoid. Overexpression of Cb2 receptor on murine myeloid precursor cells causes a block of neutrophilic differentiation, a major characteristic of myeloid leukemia. Intriguingly, we could not detect functional Cb2 receptors on normal murine bone marrow precursor cells. Furthermore, analysis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples revealed the presence of CB2 mRNA transcripts in several cases. Furthermore, migration could be induced by 2-AG when analyzed in one of the patient samples. Our data suggest that the initially identified cVIS, Evi11, encodes for a murine onco-protein and that human CB2 may be involved in certain cases of human AML as well.","['Jorda, Meritxell Alberich', 'Rayman, Nazik', 'Valk, Peter', 'De Wee, Eva', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Jorda MA', 'Rayman N', 'Valk P', 'De Wee E', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Arachidonic Acids', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid', 'Receptors, Drug/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03227.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 May;996:10-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03227.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also showed that exposure of the most primitive CD34(+) cells from normal human bone marrow to excess IL-3 stimulates not only the division of these cells but also their differentiation. In contrast, both IL-3 and G-CSF cause an expansion of the more mature types of normal CD34(+) progenitors. These findings suggested that the autocrine IL-3/G-CSF mechanism active in CML stem cells can compromise their self-renewal in spite of increasing their proliferative activity, which, in turn, might explain the paradoxically slow rate of expansion of this compartment over time in patients with latent disease. To investigate this hypothesis, we have begun to characterize the numbers and types of cells generated from chronic phase CML patients' cells transplanted into adult immunodeficient mice or fetal sheep, and also from transplants of primitive murine and human hematopoietic cells transduced with a retroviral BCR-ABL vector. Our findings to date using these models reinforce the importance of the autocrine IL-3/G-CSF mechanism in the development of CML. BCR-ABL appears to directly activate IL-3 and G-CSF production in primitive hematopoietic cells and this is important to their transplantable leukemogenic activity. However, the development in vivo of an overt leukemia from primitive BCR-ABL(+) hematopoietic cells can be very delayed. These models thus offer new opportunities for analyzing the molecular events that underlie the pathogenesis of human CML and the future testing of new therapeutic approaches.","['Eaves, Connie', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Eisterer, Wolfgang', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Porada, G', 'Zanjani, Esmail', 'Eaves, Allen']","['Eaves C', 'Jiang X', 'Eisterer W', 'Chalandon Y', 'Porada G', 'Zanjani E', 'Eaves A']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1L3, Canada. ceaves@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Sheep/embryology/metabolism']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03226.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 May;996:1-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03226.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta1 (median 33.9 ng/mL) correlated positively with highbeta2m values (> 2.5 mg/L) (p = 0.04) and was significantly higher in phase I (median 40.1 ng/mL) than in phase II (median 30.9 ng/mL) (p = 0.03) of the disease.

The concentrations of the cytokines analyzed in patients with Waldenstr m's macroglobulinaemia (WM), primary plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) and non-secretory (NS) myeloma were not distinguishable from those found in MM patients.

The NBS1 protein has been implicated in telomere biology suggesting that cells from NBS patients might have deficient telomere maintenance capacity. In this study we characterized spontaneously immortalized T-cell lines derived from three NBS patients regarding growth characteristics, telomere biology, expression of cell-cycle regulators, and response to DNA damage to understand the role of NBS1 in the immortalization process. In all the NBS T-cell lines the acquisition of an immortal phenotype was associated with telomere length stabilization, high telomerase activity, and increased mRNA expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT), together with c-myc up-regulation. Our findings provide evidence that telomere length maintenance was intact in the T lymphocytes in the absence of a full-length NBS protein, presumably due to the presence of an alternatively transcribed NBS protein of 70 kDa.

Inhibition of NO production correlated with depolarization of the P388D.1 cell V(m). Infection of P388D.1 cells with L. major increased the unidirectional influx of rubidium (86Rb), a tracer for K(+) flux, that was comparable to that induced by K(+) channel blockade by 1mM 4-AP. The similar effects of K(+) channel blockers and L. major on NO production, K(+) influx, and V(m) suggest that K(+) channel activity and the maintenance of V(m) is important for NO production in these cells.

Relationships between urban benzene exposure, oxidative DNA damage and polymorphisms in metabolism enzymes were examined in 40 volunteers living and working in Copenhagen. Personal exposures to benzene, toluene and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were monitored during a 5-day period. DNA damage was measured by 7-hydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in lymphocyte DNA and urine and by comet assay with use of fapyguanine glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (ENDO). Excretion of the benzene metabolites trans,trans-muconic acid (ttMA) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) were measured in urine. Polymorphisms in glutathione-S-transferases T1 (GSTT1), M1 (GSTM1) and P1 (GSTP1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) were determined. Median exposures to benzene, toluene and MTBE were 2.5, 18.7 and 0.86 microg/m(3). No significant correlations between external benzene exposure and any of the biomarkers were found. However, a significant correlation between S-PMA excretion and 8-oxodG in lymphocytes was found (R(s)=0.39). Men were found to excrete significantly more ttMA than the women did and ttMA excretion in men was found to be significantly associated with external benzene exposure (R=0.53, P=0.025). In addition, ttMA and S-PMA excretion was significantly higher in subjects with the NQO+/-genotype compared with subjects with the wild type (P=0.004 and P=0.011, respectively). Even though there are some limitations in this study due to the low range of benzene exposure and biomarker concentrations as well as a small number of subjects, these results could suggest that even at ambient concentrations exposure to benzene could have genotoxic effects in susceptible individuals.","['Sorensen, Mette', 'Skov, Henrik', 'Autrup, Herman', 'Hertel, Ole', 'Loft, Steffen']","['Sorensen M', 'Skov H', 'Autrup H', 'Hertel O', 'Loft S']","['Institute of Public Health, c/o Department of Pharmacology, The Panum Institute, room 18-5-32, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oxidative Stress', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Urinalysis']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0048-9697(03)00054-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00054-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 2003 Jun 20;309(1-3):69-80. doi: 10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00054-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) showed that TMZ was scarcely active on lymphocyte functions not dependent on cell proliferation (e.g. NK activity and cytokine-mediated induction of CD1b molecule in adherent MNC). In contrast, TMZ depressed proliferation and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell generation in response to IL-2. In this case, a reasonably good inverse relationship was found between OGAT levels of MNC and their susceptibility to TMZ. This study also analyzed the ratio of the toxic effect of TMZ on MNC and on tumor cells (i.e. ""Tumor-Immune Function Toxicity Index"", TIFTI). A particularly favorable TIFTI can be obtained when OGAT levels are extremely high in MNC and markedly low in tumor cells. This holds true for MRS-proficient neoplastic cells, but not for MRS-deficient tumors. In conclusion, strategies aimed at modulating OGAT and MRS may improve the clinical response to TMZ. However, the use of OGAT inhibitors to potentiate the antitumor activity of TMZ might result in a concomitant increase of the immunosuppressive effects of the drug, thus reducing the relative TIFTI.","['Pagani, E', 'Pepponi, R', 'Fuggetta, M P', 'Prete, S P', 'Turriziani, M', 'Bonmassar, L', 'Lacal, P M', 'Falcinelli, S', 'Passarelli, F', 'Guadagni, F', 'Alvino, E', ""D'Atri, S""]","['Pagani E', 'Pepponi R', 'Fuggetta MP', 'Prete SP', 'Turriziani M', 'Bonmassar L', 'Lacal PM', 'Falcinelli S', 'Passarelli F', 'Guadagni F', 'Alvino E', ""D'Atri S""]","[""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata (IDI-IRCCS), Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/drug effects/*pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/06/12 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/joc.2003.15.2.173 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 2003 Apr;15(2):173-83. doi: 10.1179/joc.2003.15.2.173.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the proportion of patients with a positive IgH/TCR result before SCT was significantly reduced at 1 month after treatment (P<0.001), attesting the efficacy of SCT, serial measurements of IgH/TCR rearrangements did not correlate with leukemic relapse. Clonal switch was demonstrated in 11 of the 14 patients with bone marrow relapse, indicating that the poor predictive power of the MRD assay most likely reflected the loss of PCR targets.

Owing to the easy quantification of bcr-abl transcripts, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was used as a model disease for proof of principle. A detection level of 10(-7) bcr-abl+ cells and purging efficiency of four logs were achievable for the bcr-abl+ cell line, K562. Leukapheresis products collected from CML patients after stem cell mobilization were then tested. For all patients tested, residual CML cells were highly sensitive to purging by NK-92 with a purging efficacy of several logs. No adverse effect on hematopoietic progenitor cell function was noted.

PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF) is a M(r) 88,000 glycoprotein growth factor. Our objective was to investigate the expression, function, and signaling pathways of PCDGF in human MM. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PCDGF expression, function, and signaling pathways in human MM were studies using two human MM cell lines: ARP-1 and RPMI 8226. In addition, PCDGF expression in MM patients was examined using 13 human bone marrow biopsy samples. RESULTS: PCDGF mRNA and protein expression was detected in human MM cell lines such as ARP-1 and RPMI 8226. PCDGF added exogenously stimulated cell growth and sustained cell survival of both ARP-1 and RPMI 8226 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Conversely, treatment with neutralizing anti-PCDGF antibody inhibited the growth of RPMI 8226 cells suggesting that PCDGF acts as an autocrine growth factor for MM cells. Studies of signal transduction pathways showed PCDGF stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathways but not the Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow smears obtained from MM patients indicated that PCDGF expression was associated with myeloma cells from MM patients and correlated with the presence of MM disease. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that PCDGF is an autocrine growth factor in the cell growth and survival of human MM cells, and may be a potential candidate as a biomarker of MM cells.","['Wang, Wengang', 'Hayashi, Jun', 'Kim, Wes E', 'Serrero, Ginette']","['Wang W', 'Hayashi J', 'Kim WE', 'Serrero G']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Progranulins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Progranulins', 'Signal Transduction']",,2003/06/11 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/06/11 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jun;9(6):2221-8.,,,['1 R01 CA 85367-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological therapies directed at lymphocytic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be mediated by these transcription factors. One such approach, CD154 (CD40-ligand) gene therapy, involves expressing CD154 on malignant B cells from CLL patients by transduction with an adenovirus vector after which the cells are reinfused into the patients. To determine the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the clinical and immunological responses observed in patients from a Phase I study of CD154 gene therapy, CLL cells from these patients were examined for changes in STAT signaling events. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CLL cells from patients who underwent CD154 gene therapy were analyzed for changes in STAT signaling by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Activation of STAT1 was correlated with patient response to therapy. RESULTS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected in the nontransduced CLL cells in 9 of 11 patients 24 h after infusion, but not before. Activation of STAT1 was associated with clinical response, as measured by decreased absolute lymphocyte count, and immunological response, as measured by elevated plasma levels of IFN-gamma. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that STAT signaling may be an important mediator of biological treatments, such as CD154 gene therapy, and that early STAT1 activation may predict response to this novel treatment.","['Battle, Traci E', 'Wierda, William G', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Zahrieh, David', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Frank, David A']","['Battle TE', 'Wierda WG', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Zahrieh D', 'Neuberg D', 'Kipps TJ', 'Frank DA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['CD40 Ligand/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2003/06/11 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/06/11 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jun;9(6):2166-72.,,,"['CA79547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the functional role of active FLT3 mutants in primary AML blast cells is not well characterized. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the transforming potential and the signaling of FLT3-ITD mutants in Ba/F3 cells and in primary AML blasts. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD mutants induce an autophosphorylation of the receptor, interleukin 3-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells, and a strong STAT5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. In contrast to the FLT3-ITD mutants, the ligand-stimulated FLT3-WT receptor was unable to transduce a fully proliferative response in Ba/F3 and monocytic OCI-AML5 cells. The ligand-stimulated FLT3-WT receptor activated AKT and MAPK, but not STAT5. In primary blast cells from 60 patients with AML, FLT3 was expressed in 91.9% of patients carrying a FLT3-LM/TKD mutation compared with 77.8% in FLT3-LM/TKD-negative patients. STAT3 and STAT5 were constitutively activated in 76 and 63% of patients, respectively. In accordance with the results in Ba/F3 cells, a high FLT3 expression and the presence of a FLT3-LM was strongly associated with the STAT5 but not with the STAT3 activation in primary AML blast cells. Moreover, the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was efficiently down-regulated by a FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor in AML cells expressing an active FLT3 mutant. CONCLUSIONS: Active FLT3 receptor mutants have transforming potential in hematopoietic cells and induce a strong activation of STAT5 in primary AML cells. The FLT3-STAT5 pathway contributes to the malignant phenotype and represents a promising molecular therapeutic target structure in AML.","['Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Bagrintseva, Ksenia', 'Schwab, Ruth', 'Schmieja, Karin', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Spiekermann K', 'Bagrintseva K', 'Schwab R', 'Schmieja K', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, GSF National Research Center for Environment and Health, 81377 Munich, Germany. spiekermann@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (SU 5614)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/06/11 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/06/11 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jun;9(6):2140-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients with chronic-phase or accelerated-phase CML either relapse after an initial response or are refractory to imatinib, prompting us to evaluate the efficacy of dose increase in such patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twelve chronic-phase patients initially receiving 400 mg/day and 4 patients with accelerated phase initially receiving either 400 mg/day (two patients) or 600 mg/day (two patients) had their dose increased (14 to 800 mg/day and 2 to 600 mg/day) because of progressive disease (usually clonal evolution) or inadequate cytogenetic response after at least 1 year of therapy. RESULTS: Six patients had major cytogenetic responses after dose increase (3 complete and 3 partial). Two others had minor cytogenetic responses. Two patients with clonal evolution transiently lost the additional clonal aberrations. Almost all of the responses occurred within 6 months, and were typically 3-6 months in duration. However, 3 patients have continuing major cytogenetic responses of >18 months duration. Dose increase was well tolerated, with thrombocytopenia, mild leukopenia, and exacerbation of prior edema being the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Although increasing the dose of imatinib can benefit a subgroup of patients with CML with either an inadequate cytogenetic response or disease progression, our results suggest the majority will not have a sustained meaningful response, and that other options, such as allogeneic stem cell transplant or investigational therapies, also need to be considered at the time of dose increase.","['Zonder, Jeffrey A', 'Pemberton, Pamela', 'Brandt, Helen', 'Mohamed, Anwar N', 'Schiffer, Charles A']","['Zonder JA', 'Pemberton P', 'Brandt H', 'Mohamed AN', 'Schiffer CA']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA. zonderj@karmanos.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2003/06/11 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/06/11 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Jun;9(6):2092-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to integrate paclitaxel and topotecan into the treatment of limited disease (LD) SCLC, we conducted a Phase I study of these agents administered as initial induction therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Escalating doses of topotecan (0.8-1.4 mg/m(2) d1-5) and paclitaxel (110-175 mg/m(2) d1) were administered i.v. every 21 days for two cycles to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with LD SCLC. This was followed by two cycles of etoposide (120 mg/m(2) d1-3) and cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) d1) with thoracic radiotherapy. The first 5 subjects received 1.8 Gy once daily x 25 fractions, while subsequent subjects received 1.5 Gy twice daily x 30 fractions. Two additional cycles of chemotherapy (topotecan and paclitaxel, followed by etoposide and cisplatin) were given. RESULTS: Common toxicities included grade >/=3 neutropenia in 67% of courses of topotecan and paclitaxel and grade >/=2 esophagitis in 71% of patients. The MTD was based on toxicity during the first two cycles of chemotherapy and defined after accrual of 18 patients to four dose levels. Two of three patients developed grade 3 nonhematological toxicity (pneumonia) at the fourth dose level. Thus, the third dose level (topotecan 1.2 mg/m(2), paclitaxel 160 mg/m(2)) was defined as the MTD recommended for Phase II studies. One subject died suddenly on day 2 of cycle 1 without autopsy confirmation of the etiology. A second subject died during cycle 3 due to thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory failure. Response rates after induction of topotecan and paclitaxel: 16 of 18 (88.8%) partial response, 1 of 18 (5.5%) complete response. Response rates after completion of therapy: 10 of 18 (55.5%) partial response, 7 of 18 (38.8%) complete response. CONCLUSIONS: Induction topotecan and paclitaxel before chemoradiotherapy in patients with LD SCLC is feasible and results in expected toxicities. The outcome of a recently closed Cancer and Leukemia Group B Phase II study of similar design (CLB-39808) should help determine whether or not this approach warrants testing in a randomized setting.","['Lu, Charles', 'Komaki, Ritsuko', 'Lee, Jin Soo', 'Shin, Dong M', 'Palmer, J Lynn', 'Coldman, Brenda J', 'Pisters, Katherine M', 'Kurie, Jonathan M', 'Fossella, Frank V', 'Glisson, Bonnie S']","['Lu C', 'Komaki R', 'Lee JS', 'Shin DM', 'Palmer JL', 'Coldman BJ', 'Pisters KM', 'Kurie JM', 'Fossella FV', 'Glisson BS']","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.

We aimed to examine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological effects of recombinant human LIF (rhLIF, emfilermin) in patients with advanced cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In stage 1 of the study, 34 patients received rhLIF or placebo (3:1 ratio) at doses of 0.25-16.0 micro g/kg/day or 4.0 micro g/kg three times daily for 7 days. In stage 2, 40 patients received rhLIF or placebo, either once daily for 14 days commencing the day after chemotherapy (0.25-8.0 micro g/kg/day) or for 7 days commencing the day before chemotherapy (4.0 micro g/kg three times daily). The chemotherapy was cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2). RESULTS: In stage 1, platelet counts increased in most patients, including those who received placebo. Blood progenitor cells increased in response to rhLIF. In stage 2, platelet recovery to baseline levels was earlier for patients receiving higher doses of rhLIF (>/=4.0 micro g/kg/day; P = 0.02). The neutrophil nadir after chemotherapy was less severe in patients receiving >/=4.0 micro g/kg/day of rhLIF. In stages 1 and 2, increases in C reactive protein were seen at higher doses. Several patients developed evidence of autonomic dysfunction, in particular impotence and episodic hypotension. The dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and rigors. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a short half-life (1-5 h) independent of dose.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA reviewed data in electronic format from a randomized controlled clinical trial of 1106 adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase, comparing imatinib with the combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine. RESULTS: Imatinib showed clinically and statistically significantly better results for time-to-progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, progression-free survival, complete hematological response rate, and cytogenetic response rate. With a median follow-up of 14 months, a maximum follow-up of 19.5 months, and an expected median survival of 5-6 years on the IFN-alpha/cytarabine control arm, few of the expected progressions to accelerated or blast phase or deaths have occurred. Imatinib was also better tolerated. Edema, nausea, rigors, neutropenia, and headache were more frequent in women. Only 57% of the IFN-alpha target dose was administered, and only 68% of patients received any cytarabine. However, this does not appear to adequately explain the superiority of imatinib observed in this trial. Results of a population pharmacokinetic study in a subgroup of 371 patients and a separate rifampin-imatinib drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers are presented. CONCLUSIONS: On December 20, 2002, imatinib was granted accelerated approval under subpart H, rather than regular approval. Follow-up is short compared with the natural history of chronic phase CML or more mature results with established therapies such as IFN-alpha or transplantation. If imatinib should stop working after 1.5-2 years, the results could be importantly different from the present analysis. As a Phase IV postmarketing commitment, the applicant has agreed to provide follow-up reports on this imatinib study annually for the next 6 years.","['Johnson, John R', 'Bross, Peter', 'Cohen, Martin', 'Rothmann, Mark', 'Chen, Gang', 'Zajicek, Anne', 'Gobburu, Joga', 'Rahman, Atiqur', 'Staten, Ann', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Johnson JR', 'Bross P', 'Cohen M', 'Rothmann M', 'Chen G', 'Zajicek A', 'Gobburu J', 'Rahman A', 'Staten A', 'Pazdur R']","['Division of Oncology Drug Products (HFD-150), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, United States Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20857, USA.

Several modified steroid compounds as 17beta-acetamido and D-homo-aza steroids that contain the NHCO group outside or inside D steroid ring, respectively, were used in the synthesis of steroidal esters carrying alkylating moieties. As it has been reported previously, several of these compounds produced important both antileukemic and antitumor results. In this work, we comparatively study, evaluate, and conclude on the acute toxicity on mice, the in vivo antileukemic activity against P388 and L1210 murine leukemias, as well the in vitro antileukemic effect on three well established human leukemia cell lines (K562, MOLT-4, ML-1) of eight D-homo-aza-steroidal (HASE) and the corresponding steroidal 17beta-amido-esters (SAE) of three alkylating molecules. The compound screening indicated that HASE induced lower acute toxicity and significant higher antileukemic effect than SAE, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the structure of the homo-aza-steroidal vector seems to be a determinant of the toxicity and antineoplastic activity of the esters. Conclusively, HASE presented low acute toxicity but significant high antileukemic activity. These results point out that HASE may be of important therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of leukemia in humans.","['Camoutsis, Charalambos', 'Trafalis, Dimitrios T P']","['Camoutsis C', 'Trafalis DT']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Health Science, University of Patras, Greece. c.kamoutsis@upatras.gr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Azasteroids)', '0 (Esters)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Azasteroids/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Esters', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate']",,2003/06/11 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/06/11 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1022964225715 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2003 Feb;21(1):47-54. doi: 10.1023/a:1022964225715.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Founding clones CEM-C7 (glucocorticoid sensitive) and CEM-C1 (glucocorticoid resistant) were subcloned to maximize uniformity of each population studied. Among subclones of C1, our original pseudodiploid clone of glucocorticoid-resistant cells, we found a high proportion of hyperploid clones. Most C1 subclones were glucocorticoid resistant but two C1 subclones were found to be revertants to glucocorticoid sensitivity. Glucocorticoid receptor content of the C1 subclones varied almost 5-fold but higher quantity of receptors did not guarantee steroid sensitivity. Gene expression analysis was carried out on microchips containing representations for approximately 12,600 human genes. When a group of four subclones from C1 (three glucocorticoid-resistant and one glucocorticoid-sensitive revertant) were compared with the glucocorticoid-sensitive subclone CEM-C7-14 for basal gene expression, the four C1 subclones clustered closely and far from C7-14. Thus, basal gene expression in the C1 subclones differed for a large number of genes from that in the C7 subclone. Reversion to glucocorticoid sensitivity did not cause a major shift in basal gene expression to a more C7-like state. Three clones (one revertant glucocorticoid sensitive from C1 subclone, one C7 sensitive subclone, and one C1 glucocorticoid-resistant subclone) were compared for the genes regulated by treatment for 20 hours with 10(-6)M Dex. This interval brings the cells to a point just before the onset of apoptosis. We tested the hypothesis that a distinctive set of genes would be regulated in the glucocorticoid-sensitive clones. This proved to be so. In three experiments, at our chosen levels of discrimination, 39 genes were consistently induced > or = 2.5-fold and 21 genes were consistently reduced > or = 2-fold in glucocorticoid-sensitive clones but not in the glucocorticoid-resistant clone. The glucocorticoid-resistant clone showed induction or reduction of 88 genes different from those regulated in the glucocorticoid-sensitive clones. These data support our hypothesis and further show that the glucocorticoid-resistant clone is capable of responding to steroid but with a different set of genes. We propose that a general metabolic switch accounts for the alteration.","['Thompson, E Brad', 'Johnson, Betty H']","['Thompson EB', 'Johnson BH']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-0645, USA. bthompso@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Recent Prog Horm Res,Recent progress in hormone research,0404471,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",66,2003/06/11 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/11 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/rp.58.1.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Recent Prog Horm Res. 2003;58:175-97. doi: 10.1210/rp.58.1.175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thermal shift was found to induce rapid increase in cell volume for cells lacking a cell wall (yeast spheroplasts and human leukaemia cells). This increase in cell volume is assumed to be a main cause of the heat shock-induced cell death.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-four patients less than 19 years old with lymphoid precursor cell leukemia in hematologic remission and without central nervous system (CNS) compromise were included. Cytology, cytochemistry, cell count, and qualitative RT-PCR were performed using routine CSF samples obtained during intrathecal chemotherapy administration. The main outcome measure was clinical, radiologic, and cytologic evidence of CNS, hematologic or any other type of neoplastic relapse. RESULTS: At some time during follow-up, 28.7% of the patients had a positive WT1 CSF test. Relapses included 10 patients with isolated hematologic, 4 with isolated CNS, 1 with combined CNS and hematologic, and 1 with mediastinal relapse; the maximal follow-up period was 312 days. A statistically significant association was found between the detection of WT1 in CSF and CNS relapse. Adjusted hazard rate ratios of 5.04 (95% confidence interval 1.33-19.12) and 7.48 (2.34-23.93) were estimated for isolated hematologic relapse and for all types of relapses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is likely that the short follow-up period underestimated the incidence of relapse, this study was able to identify a strong association between WT1 mRNA detection and CNS or hematologic relapse. These findings represent a potentially novel and useful approach for subclinical disease detection.","['Ramirez, Oscar', 'Linares, Adriana', 'Trujillo, Marta Liliana', 'Caminos, Jorge Eduardo']","['Ramirez O', 'Linares A', 'Trujillo ML', 'Caminos JE']","['Cancer Unit, Fundacion Clinica Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia. osramire@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Child', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*cerebrospinal fluid/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,2003/06/10 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/06/10 05:00'],"['2003/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200306000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Jun;25(6):453-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200306000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to perform an economic evaluation in the same cohort. METHODS: In this open-label multicenter randomized trial, prophylactic G-CSF was administered after consolidation therapy courses. Economic data were retrospectively quantified for each patient: hospital stays, drugs, and blood products. RESULTS: Sixty-seven children were enrolled in the very high-risk branch of the FRALLE 93 protocol. Chemotherapy dose-intensity was significantly increased (105 +/- 5% in the G-CSF group vs. 91 +/- 4% in the non-G-CSF group, P < 0.001). The mean total costs per child were not statistically different: 32,309 dollars in the G-CSF group versus 31,569 dollars in the non-G-CSF group. Further analysis per child and per course (R3 or COPADM) demonstrated that the mean cost of hospitalization and the mean cost of intravenous antibiotics were significantly decreased in the G-CSF group after R3 courses (3,857 dollars vs. 4,993.80 dollars, P < 0.001; 171.40 dollars vs. 306.20 dollars, P = 0.029, respectively), but the cost of platelet transfusion was significantly increased (P = 0.03). Conversely, post-COPADM costs were similar. Finally, mean costs per course in the two randomized groups were not significantly different: 5,848.80 dollars versus 6,181 dollars and 7,388.10 dollars versus 6,475.70 dollars for R3 and COPADM, respectively. The 3-year probability of event-free survival between the two groups was not different. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF can increase chemotherapy dose-intensity in very high-risk ALL without raising costs, but event-free survival was not improved. The cost benefit of prophylactic treatment by G-CSF relies on the chemotherapeutic regimen given prior to G-CSF administration.","['Delorme, Jean', 'Badin, Stephanie', 'Le Corroller, Anne-Gaelle G', 'Auvrignon, Anne Aurtignon', 'Auclerc, Marie-Francoise', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Lamagnere, Jean-Pierre', 'Demeocq, Francois', 'Perel, Yves', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Bauduer, Francois', 'Pautard, Brigitte', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre', 'Braguer, Diane', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Michel, Gerard']","['Delorme J', 'Badin S', 'Le Corroller AG', 'Auvrignon AA', 'Auclerc MF', 'Gandemer V', 'Bordigoni P', 'Lamagnere JP', 'Demeocq F', 'Perel Y', 'Berthou C', 'Bauduer F', 'Pautard B', 'Vannier JP', 'Braguer D', 'Leblanc T', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Michel G']","['Department of Pharmacy, Research Unit INSERM No. 379, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*economics/prevention & control', 'Palliative Care/economics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*economics/mortality/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/06/10 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/06/10 05:00'],"['2003/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200306000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Jun;25(6):441-7. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200306000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the in vitro generation of CTL against mHA in the dog. We tested their inhibitory effect on the growth of hemopoietic progenitor cells stimulated by hemopoietic growth factors in a 4-day suspension culture. CTL were produced by coculture of donor PBMC with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). These DCs were characterized by morphology, high expression of MHC class II and CD1a, and the absence of the monocyte-specific marker CD14. Characteristically these cells stimulated allogeneic lymphocytes (MLR) and, after pulsing with a foreign Ag (keyhole limpet hemocyanin), autologous T cells. CTL were generated either ex vivo by coculture with DCs of DLA-identical littermates or in vivo by immunization of the responder with DCs obtained from a DLA-identical littermate. In suspension culture assays the growth of hemopoietic progenitor cells was inhibited in 53% of DLA-identical littermate combinations. In canine families mHA segregated with DLA as restriction elements. One-way reactivity against mHA was found in five littermate combinations. In two cases mHA might be Y chromosome associated, in three cases autosomally inherited alleles were detected. We conclude that CTL can be produced in vitro and in vivo against mHA on canine hemopoietic progenitor cells using bone marrow-derived DCs.","['Weber, Martin', 'Lange, Claudia', 'Gunther, Wolfgang', 'Franz, Monika', 'Kremmer, Elisabeth', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem']","['Weber M', 'Lange C', 'Gunther W', 'Franz M', 'Kremmer E', 'Kolb HJ']","['Clinical Cooperative Group Hemopoietic Cell Transplantation, University of Munich, Munich, Germany. m.weber@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Dogs', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",,2003/06/10 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/06/10 05:00'],"['2003/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.12.5861 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Jun 15;170(12):5861-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.12.5861.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These oncoproteins retain the ability to bind DNA and retinoic acid through the RARalpha moiety. This enables them to repress RARalpha target genes in the absence of retinoic acid, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated. Here we use the frog oocyte system to study transcriptional regulation by PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha in the context of chromatin. We first show that the endogenous corepressor N-CoR forms a complex with TBLR1 (transducin beta-like protein 1-related protein) and that both N-CoR and TBLR1 can interact with unliganded PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha in vivo. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that both oncoproteins recruit TBLR1, as well as N-CoR, to its target promoter, leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative N-CoR that contains the TBLR1-interacting domain blocks transcription repression by unliganded PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha. Thus, our studies provide in vivo evidence for targeted recruitment of N-CoR-TBLR1 complexes by PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha in transcriptional repression in the context of chromatin.","['Tomita, Akihiro', 'Buchholz, Daniel R', 'Obata, Keiko', 'Shi, Yun-Bo']","['Tomita A', 'Buchholz DR', 'Obata K', 'Shi YB']","['Unit on Molecular Morphogenesis, Lab. of Gene Regulation and Development, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-5431, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (TBL1XR1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (nuclear receptor corepressor, Xenopus)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",,2003/06/10 05:00,2003/11/11 05:00,['2003/06/10 05:00'],"['2003/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M303309200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)84111-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Aug 15;278(33):30788-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M303309200.

DESIGN: Observational, nonrandomized report of two cases. SETTING: Intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Two pediatric patients (an 11-yr-old male and a 12-yr-old female) affected by acute promyelocytic leukemia. INTERVENTIONS: Pressure support ventilation was delivered via a nasal mask by means of a bilevel positive pressure ventilator (Respironics, Murrysville, PA). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated the effects of the bilevel positive pressure ventilator on blood gas analysis, respiratory rate, hemodynamics, patient tolerance, complications, and outcome. Patients showed an improvement of blood gas analysis and respiratory rate after 3-6 hrs of noninvasive ventilation. The nasal mask was well tolerated by the two patients. No complications were observed. Patients were discharged from the intensive care unit in stable clinical conditions after 3-4 days. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive ventilation by a nasal mask can offer effective ventilatory support and improve gas exchange in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in pediatric hematologic patients. In addition, noninvasive ventilation may decrease the risk of life-threatening complications associated with endotracheal intubation and conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Cogliati, Andrea A', 'Conti, Giorgio', 'Tritapepe, Luigi', 'Canneti, Alessandra', 'Rosa, Giovanni']","['Cogliati AA', 'Conti G', 'Tritapepe L', 'Canneti A', 'Rosa G']","['Institute of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy. a.cogliati@azuba.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,,,,,2003/06/10 05:00,2003/06/10 05:01,['2003/06/10 05:00'],"['2003/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/10 05:01 [medline]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00130478-200201000-00016 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2002 Jan;3(1):70-3. doi: 10.1097/00130478-200201000-00016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 3500 subjects provided genetic counseling 28.7% were for prenatal diagnosis, 13.7% for mental retardation +/- malformations, 11.5% for thalassemia, hemophilia and leukemia, 8.5% for neural tube defects and other malformations, and 8% for muscle dystrophy and spinal muscle atrophy. Chromosomal studies in blood (n = 5459) were for recurrent abortions (57.8%), delayed milestones (14.7%), malformations (11%), and infertility and amenorrhea (10.2%). Indications for amniotic fluid studies (n = 835) were advanced maternal age (35.7%), high risk result on triple test (21.3%), previous child with trisomy 21 (21.3%) and abnormalities seen on ultrasound (11.1%). Molecular studies were mostly for thalassemia (843, 24.3%), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (443, 12.5%), fragile X syndrome (367, 10.3%), spinal muscular atrophy (315, 8.9%), thrombophilia profile (233, 6.6%), triplet repeat disorders-spinocerebellar ataxias, Huntington disease and Friedreich ataxia-162 (4.6%), cystic fibrosis 140 (3.9%) and mitochondrial disorders 101 (2.9%). Other disorders for which molecular diagnosis was done were intrauterine infections by PCR on the amniotic fluid, Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes, hemophilia, achondroplasia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Apert syndrome etc. In biochemical studies triple marker tests were the most common (3239), followed by aminoacid chromatography (774). Among neurolipidosis metachromatic leukodystrophy was the commonest, followed by Krabbe's disease, Tay Sach disease and Gaucher disease. Of the mucopolysacharidoses Hurler syndrome was the commonest, followed by Hunter syndrome.

Phenothiazines containing aromatic moieties were bound through stacking interaction involving the polarization of the aromatic aminoacid substituents at the target site of p-glycoprotein (Pgp) 170, as a consequence of their large dipoles (as in the binding of phenothiazine to calmodulin-like structures). Acting as a calcium channel blocker, verapamil may induce conformational changes in the calcium channel-like structures of the transmembrane regions of Pgp. Most probably the tyrosine moieties of Pgp are involved in the action of verapamil and phenothiazines. Tomato lectin specifically binds to the polylactosamine moiety of Pgp170 at the first loop of Pgp. Other targets in the membrane may exist in close proximity to Pgp170, such as conA-reactive glycoproteins with terminal mannosyl residues. WGA-reactive N-acetyl glucosamine residues can also be modified resulting in conformational changes in trans-membrane regions of the ABC transporter.

These leukemias are characterized by the presence of blasts, which express CD56, in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and/or extranodal tissues. We report a case that is morphologically consistent with myeloid/NK-cell acute leukemia but immunologically is myeloid/NK-cell precursor acute leukemia. This case is unique in its cutaneous presentation without involvement of the peripheral blood. Extensive flow cytometric studies were performed on the skin biopsy and bone marrow aspirate specimens, which included many markers that had not been tested before in these entities. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Sun, Tsieh', 'Pashaei, Shayesteh', 'Jaffrey, Ira', 'Ryder, John']","['Sun T', 'Pashaei S', 'Jaffrey I', 'Ryder J']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Denver, CO, 80220, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'BEAM protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'CD2 Antigens/metabolism', 'Carmustine', 'Cytarabine', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan', 'Podophyllotoxin']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S004681770300087X [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(03)00087-x [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2003 May;34(5):504-8. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(03)00087-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the antiproliferative effect of monensin on human myeloma cell lines. Monensin significantly inhibited the proliferation of myeloma cell lines examined with IC50 of about 1 micro M. Cell cycle analysis indicated that monensin induced a G1 and/or a G2-M phase arrest in these cell lines. To address the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of monensin, we examined the effect of this drug on cell cycle-related proteins in NCI-H929 cells. Monensin decreased the levels of CDK2, CDK6, cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and cyclin E proteins but did not alter CDK4 protein. While p21 was increased by monensin, p27 was not. In addition, monensin markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with CDK6 and cdc2. Furthermore, the activities of CDK2- and CDK6-associated kinases were reduced in association with hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. The activity of cdc2-associated kinase was decreased, which was accompanied by reduction of cdc25C phosphatase. Also, monensin induced apoptosis in myeloma cells, as evidenced by annexin V binding assay and flow cytometric detection of sub-G1 DNA content. This apoptotic process was associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2, loss of mitochondria transmembrane potential (Deltapsim) and an increase of caspase-3 activity. In addition, monensin caused the up-regulation of ERK and p38 kinase activities. Taken together, these results have demonstrated for the first time that monensin potently inhibited the proliferation of human myeloma cell lines, especially NCI-H929 cells, via cell cycle arrest in association with p21 and apoptosis.","['Park, Woo Hyun', 'Kim, Eun Shil', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Lee, Young Yiul']","['Park WH', 'Kim ES', 'Kim BK', 'Lee YY']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tagln protein, mouse)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Cdc25c protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Models, Chemical', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Jul;23(1):197-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As shown, bcr-abl activates the ras pathway by phosphorylation of adapter proteins such as Grb-2 and Crkl. Functional inhibition of p21ras might partially inhibit the mitogenic signaling by bcr-abl. By depletion of cellular mevalonate pools, p21ras proteins can be rendered non-functional as a result of deficient post-translational protein farnesylation. We investigated the pharmacologic effect of mevalonate depletion by lovastatin in conjunction with interferon-alpha 2b (INF-alpha 2b) in bcr-abl positive K562 cells. At various concentrations, both drugs synergistically reduced cell proliferation of CML line K562 in a liquid culture system as well as clonal growth of colony forming units in a patient with newly diagnosed CML. Lovastatin and IFN-alpha 2b in combination led to cell cycle arrest and resulted in significant reduction of phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine protein residues. IFN-alpha 2b alone showed little effect on protein phosphorylation but strongly enhanced lovastatin driven loss of phosphorylation. Subsequently, DNA fragmentation occurred in 50% of cells. In conclusion, exposure to IFN-alpha 2b and lovastatin synergistically inhibited proliferation of bcr-abl positive cells and resulted in loss of protein phosphorylation and subsequent apoptosis in K562 cells.

The processes were studied at the morphological level by fluorescence microscopy and, quantitatively, by flow cytometry. The results showed that the actin cytoskeleton underwent specific structural changes during the apoptotic process, but microtubules were not actively involved. In the initial stages of apoptosis, a fine meshwork of actin filaments turned into actin granules that, in the final stages, were transformed into a network of long actin fibres distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These actin structures were considered to play an active role in two main morphological events of apoptosis - formation of blebs and final cell disintegration into apoptotic bodies.

In this study, we demonstrate that human mast cells are able to trigger apoptosis in Jurkat T leukemia cells. Fragmentation of Jurkat cell DNA was detectable by JAM assay within 4 h of exposure to HMC-1 mast cells or cultured human cord blood-derived mast cells. HMC-1 mast cells that were fixed with paraformaldehyde retained the ability to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells while cell-free conditioned supernatants from HMC-1 cell cultures failed to elicit DNA fragmentation, suggesting that mast cells mediate anti-tumor activity via a cell-surface molecule. Surprisingly, the apoptosis-inducing activity of HMC-1 mast cells was not mediated by known tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members (TNF-alpha, Fas ligand, TRAIL, TWEAK), nor did the fragmentation of Jurkat cell DNA by mast cells require the activity of caspase-3, -8, or -9.

A total of 49 courses of DNX were administered [3 pts at 40 mg/m(2) (for a total of 13 courses), 5 at 60 mg/m(2) (20 courses), 4 at 75 mg/m(2) (12 courses), and 2 at 90 mg/m(2) (4 courses)]. The mean cumulative dose of DNX administered was 340 mg (range, 120-1200). A 20% decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure was noted in 2 patients after a cumulative DNX dose of 480 mg, both with pre-existing heart disease. Even at the highest cumulative doses of DNX, no further decline in LVEF was noted. Nausea, vomiting, alopecia and mucositis were absent. All patients had significant myelosuppression requiring transfusion support. During treatment, 3 patients showed a 25% reduction of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, 3 patients had to be excluded due to AML progression after the 2nd DNX course, and 7 patients died during the first 6 weeks of treatment. We conclude from these data that DNX offers a less toxic alternative to DNR and other anthracyclines. Using DNX dosages of 40 to 90 mg/m(2) biweekly seems to have little anti-leukemic activity in a patient population heavily pretreated with anthracyclines.","['Bieker, Ralf', 'Lerchenmuller, Christian', 'Wehmeyer, Jurgen', 'Serve, Hubert L', 'Mesters, Rolf M', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E']","['Bieker R', 'Lerchenmuller C', 'Wehmeyer J', 'Serve HL', 'Mesters RM', 'Buchner T', 'Berdel WE']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, D-48129 Munster, Germany. biekerr@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Salvage Therapy']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2003 Jul-Aug;10(4):915-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of AML in the elderly is complicated not only by comorbidities but also by the high prevalence of poor prognosis markers. Thirty-one consecutive unselected patients with AML older than 60 years (representing 33% of all AML cases diagnosed at our institution during the same period) were followed over a period of 5 years (1997-2002). A high incidence of AML with multilineage dysplasia (45%) and no favorable cytogenetic abnormalities but 62% intermediate and 38% unfavorable karyotypes were found. Sixteen patients (52%) were selected for induction of intensive cytotoxic treatment and complete remission was achieved only by some of these intensively treated patients (7 of 16). Of these, 3 remained alive without disease (median: 11 months), 1 patient died shortly after complete remission, and 3 patients relapsed and died from refractory disease. Only 1 patient that was refractory to intensive cytotoxic treatment remained alive with disease under supportive care. Fifteen patients (48%) were managed with palliative/supportive care: 7 received palliative treatment and supportive care, 8 received supportive care only, and 4 patients remained alive with disease under supportive care (median: 9 months). Mortality rate was 74% and overall survival at two years was 12%. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding elderly patients with AML in Brazilian subsets. The present data are similar to previously reported studies showing that elderly AML patients are not only older but also biologically distinct from younger AML patients, particularly in terms of the high incidence of poor prognostic karyotypes and resistance to therapy.","['Rodrigues, C A', 'Chauffaille, M L L F', 'Pelloso, L A F', 'Ghaname, F S', 'Kerbauy, D M B', 'Campos, M G V', 'Yamamoto, M']","['Rodrigues CA', 'Chauffaille ML', 'Pelloso LA', 'Ghaname FS', 'Kerbauy DM', 'Campos MG', 'Yamamoto M']","['Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil. chauffaill@hemato.epm.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2003000600004 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2003000600004 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2003 Jun;36(6):703-8. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2003000600004.

Previous studies have shown that the Wilms' tumor antigen-1 (WT1) transcription factor is expressed at elevated levels in hematopoietic stem cells of leukemia patients compared with normal stem cells. In the past, we have generated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for WT1, and we have shown that they killed WT1-expressing leukemia cell lines and inhibited the in vitro colony-forming activity of leukemia cells of patients. We used a xenotransplantation model to address whether WT1-specific CTL can selectively inhibit engraftment of malignant but not normal stem cells. CD34+ hematopoietic cells isolated from individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia or normal hematopoiesis were treated with WT1-specific CTL and injected into immunodeficient non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice. After 5 to 8 weeks, engraftment of leukemic or normal human cells was analyzed using immunohistology, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of human sequences. The data showed that exposure of chronic myeloid leukemia CD34+ cells to WT1-specifc CTL completely prevented the development of leukemia in the recipient mice, whereas CTL treatment did not inhibit engraftment of normal CD34+ stem cells. The experiments indicate that WT1-specific CTL can discriminate between stem cells that give raise to leukemia and normal hematopoiesis in the xenogenic transplantation model. This supports the use of CTL with this specificity for treatment of leukemia patients undergoing stem-cell transplantation.","['Gao, Liquan', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Hasserjian, Robert', 'Cotter, Finbarr', 'Kaeda, Jaspal', 'Goldman, John M', 'Dazzi, Fancesco', 'Stauss, Hans J']","['Gao L', 'Xue SA', 'Hasserjian R', 'Cotter F', 'Kaeda J', 'Goldman JM', 'Dazzi F', 'Stauss HJ']","['Department of Immunology and Haematology, Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.TP.0000061516.57346.E8 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 May 15;75(9):1429-36. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000061516.57346.E8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We 1) performed weekly funduscopic examinations on 77 medical and surgical patients in intensive care units (ICUs), 2) analyzed results of serial ocular examinations in 180 non-neutropenic patients with candidemia, and 3) reviewed the English literature on the association of retinal lesions with disseminated bacterial or candidal infection (DBCI). We found that 15 (19%) of the ICU patients had retinal lesions consistent with DBCI. Of these 15, 1 had clearly sepsis-related retinal lesions, while 13 (87%) had 1 or more systemic disease that could have explained their retinal findings (6 diabetic retinopathy; 2 human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) retinopathy; 2 hypertensive retinopathy; 1 hemolytic uremic syndrome, and 1 leukemia). Multivariate analysis revealed that systemic disease (odds ratio 8.37, 95% confidence intervals: 3.24-21.56) independently correlated with the presence of retinal lesions while DBCI, trauma, hyperalimentation, and transfusion of blood products were not independently predictive in any analysis. Twenty of the 180 (15%) candidemic patients had retinal lesions. Two (1%) had classic 3-dimensional white lesions with vitreal extension, and 5 (2.7%) had chorioretinal lesions without vitreal haziness. Notably, 10% of patients had superficial retinal hemorrhages and/or cotton wool spots that could have been due to either candidemia or a systemic disease (diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, closed head trauma). Concurrent bacteremia occurred in 3 of the 27 patients with eye lesions. Retinal lesions resolved in a mean of 33 days. None of the patients had symptoms at the time of the retinal finding. We found 3 studies that prospectively assessed retinal lesions in bacteremic patients. The frequency of retinal lesions in these series varied from 12% to 26%, with the most common lesions being cotton wool spots followed by superficial retinal hemorrhages. White-centered hemorrhages were seen in about 15% +/- 2 of bacteremic patients. Five studies prospectively evaluated candidemic patients for Candida endophthalmitis. These studies observed rates from 0% to 78% for lesions consistent with candidal endophthalmitis. Most studies performed recently found that nonspecific lesions such as cotton wool spots or superficial retinal hemorrhages occurred with a frequency of 11% to 20%. The availability of less toxic antifungal agents, more frequent use of empirical therapy, and the trend to early treatment may be altering the frequency of this complication. Observation of a classic 3-dimensional retina-based vitreal inflammatory process is virtually diagnostic of endogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida spp., but such lesions are relatively uncommon. Conversely, nonspecific lesions that could be due to bacterial or candidal endophthalmitis (cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, and Roth spots) are seen frequently. These lesions are most often due to an underlying systemic disease rather than an infection. Serial examinations provide the best evidence that a given lesion is due to an intercurrent infection. The current low rate of vitreal extension of retinal process appears to be due to the high rate of empirical or therapeutic use of antifungal agents in high-risk patient groups. Ophthalmoscopy should be performed in patients with known candidemia. However, ophthalmoscopic examination seems to have little value in assisting with the discovery of occult disseminated candidiasis or bacterial infection.","['Rodriguez-Adrian, Libsen J', 'King, Robert T', 'Tamayo-Derat, Luis G', 'Miller, John W', 'Garcia, Charles A', 'Rex, John H']","['Rodriguez-Adrian LJ', 'King RT', 'Tamayo-Derat LG', 'Miller JW', 'Garcia CA', 'Rex JH']","['Infectious Disease Division, Centro Medico Docente La Trinidad, Caracas, Venezuela. libsenra@cantv.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Corynebacterium Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retinal Diseases/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Staphylococcal Infections/complications/drug therapy']",30,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.md.0000076008.64510.f1 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2003 May;82(3):187-202. doi: 10.1097/01.md.0000076008.64510.f1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has long been recognized that this situation offers a unique opportunity to identify aspects of the developmental timing, natural history, and molecular genetics of pediatric leukemia in general. We reviewed both the older literature and more recent molecular biologic studies that have uncovered the basis of concordance of leukemia. Molecular markers of clonality, including unique, genomic fusion gene sequences, have provided unequivocal evidence that twin pairs of leukemia have a common clonal origin. The only plausible basis for this, first suggested more than 40 years ago, is that following initiation of leukemia in one twin fetus, clonal progeny spread to the co-twin via vascular anastomoses within a single, monochorionic placenta. This explanation has been endorsed by the identification of clonotypic gene fusion sequences in archived neonatal blood spots of individuals who subsequently developed leukemia. These analyses of twin leukemias have thrown considerable light on the natural history of disease. They reveal a frequent prenatal origin and an early or initiating role for chromosome translocations. Further, they provide evidence for a variable and often protracted latency and the need, in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), for further postnatal exposures and/or genetic events to produce clinical disease. We argue that these insights provide a very useful framework for attempts to understand etiologic mechanisms.","['Greaves, Mel F', 'Maia, Ana Teresa', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Ford, Anthony M']","['Greaves MF', 'Maia AT', 'Wiemels JL', 'Ford AM']","['Leukemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, 237 Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom. m.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*genetics/physiopathology', '*Twins, Monozygotic']",138,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3817 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44057-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Oct 1;102(7):2321-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3817.

A white blood cell (WBC) count higher than 50 x 109/L was found in 13 of 24, 2 of 6, and 6 of 36 of the ALL1/AF4-positive, BCR/ABL-positive, and ALL1/AF4-BCR/AB-negative patients, respectively (P =.007).

By contrast, CD13 and CD33 molecules were detected, respectively, in 3 of 6 and in 14 of 33 cases of the BCR/ABL-positive patient group, and in 2 of 6 and 9 of 35 cases of the ALL1/AF4-BCR/ABL-negative patient group. These differences still remained statistically significant even if the BCR/ABL-positive patients were excluded from the analysis. A complete remission (CR) was achieved in 52 (83.4%) of the 62 patients with ALL evaluable for response to treatment. CR rates were similar in the 3 genotypic groups.

We hypothesized that host-versus-graft (HVG) alloresponses might induce antitumor effects against recipient tumors. We explored this question in mice by administering recipient leukocyte infusions (RLIs) to mixed chimeras established with nonmyeloablative conditioning. Mixed chimeras were prepared in the B10.A (H2a)-->B6 (H2b) strain combination using depleting anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cyclophosphamide, and thymic irradiation. B6 myeloid leukemia cells (MMB3.19) were administered 7 days following donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or RLI on day 35. Conversion to full donor chimerism occurred without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following DLI, whereas RLI led to loss of chimerism. Both RLI and DLI significantly delayed tumor mortality. In another strain combination (B10.BR [H2k]-->BALB/c [H2d]), RLI-induced or spontaneous loss of chimerism was associated with antitumor effects against the host-type B-cell lymphoma A20. HCT was essential for the antitumor effect of RLI. RLI induced elevated serum interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels, and recipient-derived IFN-gamma was critical for their antitumor effects. Thus, HVG reactions (spontaneous or induced by RLI) mediate antitumor effects against hematologic malignancies via a recipient-derived IFN-gamma-mediated mechanism. A novel approach to achieving anti-tumor effects without the risk of GVHD is suggested.","['Rubio, Marie-Therese', 'Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Sachs, Teviah', 'Mapara, Markus', 'Zhao, Guiling', 'Sykes, Megan']","['Rubio MT', 'Kim YM', 'Sachs T', 'Mapara M', 'Zhao G', 'Sykes M']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, MGH-East Bldg 149-5102, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 13th Street, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Host vs Graft Reaction/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality/prevention & control', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3949 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50528-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2300-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3949.

To investigate the pathway(s) by which P210BCR-ABL influences cell adhesion, we used a quantitative cell adhesion device that can discern small changes in cell adhesion to assay P210BCR-ABL with mutations in several critical domains. We expressed P210BCR-ABL mutants in 32D myeloblast cells and found that binding to fibronectin is mediated primarily by the alpha5beta1 integrin. We performed a structure/function analysis to map domains important for cell adhesion. Increased adhesion was mediated by 3 domains: (1) the N-terminal coiled-coil domain that facilitates oligomerization and F-actin localization; (2) bcr sequences between aa 163 to 210; and (3) F-actin localization through the C-terminal actin-binding domain of c-abl. We compared our adhesion results with the ability of these mutants to cause a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like disease in a murine bone marrow transplantation assay and found that adhesion to fibronectin did not correlate with the ability of these mutants to cause CML. Together, our results suggest that F-actin localization may play a pivotal role in modulating adhesion but that it is dispensable for the development of CML.","['Wertheim, Jason A', 'Perera, Samanthi A', 'Hammer, Daniel A', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Boettiger, David', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Wertheim JA', 'Perera SA', 'Hammer DA', 'Ren R', 'Boettiger D', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 611 BRB II/III, 421 Curie Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0062 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50517-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2220-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0062.

In adult AML, FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are more common in cases with MLL intragenic abnormalities (33%) than those with MLL translocation (8%). Mutation/deletion involving FLT3 D835 are found in more than 20% of cases with MLL intragenic abnormalities compared with 10% of AML with MLL translocation and 5% of adult AML with normal MLL status. Real-time quantification of FLT3 in 141 cases of AML showed that all cases with FLT3 D835 express high level transcripts, whereas FLT3-ITD AML can be divided into cases with high-level FLT3 expression, which belong essentially to the monocytic lineage, and those with relatively low-level expression, which predominantly demonstrate PML-RARA and DEK-CAN. FLT3 abnormalities in CBF leukemias with AML1-ETO or CBFbeta-MYH11 were virtually restricted to cases with variant CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion transcripts and/or atypical morphology. These data suggest that the FLT3 and MLL loci demonstrate similar susceptibility to agents that modify chromatin configuration, including topoisomerase II inhibitors and abnormalities involving PML and DEK, with consequent errors in DNA repair. Variant CBFbeta-MYH11 fusions and bcr3 PML-RARA may also be initiated by similar mechanisms.","['Libura, Marta', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Tu, Angela', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Solbu, Gabriel', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Libura M', 'Asnafi V', 'Tu A', 'Delabesse E', 'Tigaud I', 'Cymbalista F', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Villarese P', 'Solbu G', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Beldjord K', 'Hermine O', 'Macintyre E']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Tour Pasteur, Hopital Necker, 149-161 rue de Sevres, 75743 Paris cedex 15, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0162 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50514-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2198-204. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0162.

Postgrafting immunosuppression included mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Donor T-cell chimerism was higher for G-PBMCs compared with marrow recipients. Durable engraftment was observed in 85% of G-PBMCs and 56% of marrow recipients.

We characterized the differentiation defect of Shp-2Delta46-110 ES cells by examining early points of differentiation, conducting leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-stimulated biochemical analysis, and performing in vitro reconstitution studies with wild-type (WT) Shp-2. ES cell in vitro differentiation assays were used to compare the differentiation of WT, Shp-2Delta46-110, and reconstituted ES cells to mesoderm, by measuring brachyury expression, to hemangioblasts, by measuring blast colony-forming cell (BL-CFC) formation and flk-1 expression, and to hematopoietic progenitor colony-forming cells, by performing secondary plating assays. LIF-stimulated phospho-Stat3 (known to be critical for ES cell self-renewal and maintenance of an undifferentiated state) and phospho-Erk levels were examined by immunoblotting. ES cell survival, using annexin V staining, and secondary embryoid body (EB) formation were also evaluated. Differentiation to both mesoderm and hemangioblasts was lower in Shp-2Delta46-110 cells compared to WT cells. On reconstitution with WT Shp-2, expression of brachyury and flk-1 and differentiation to hemangioblasts and primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors were restored. LIF-stimulated phospho-Stat3 levels were higher, whereas phospho-Erk levels were lower in Shp-2Delta46-110 ES cells than in WT and reconstituted cells. The increased phospho-Stat3 levels correlated with increased Shp-2Delta46-110 ES cell secondary EB formation and survival.

This study employed Langendorff perfusion to determine the direct effects of As(2)O(3) in the electrophysiological properties of rabbit hearts after acute or chronic As(2)O(3) treatment (0.2 mg/kg/day iv for 30 days). Tissue accumulations of arsenicals and pathological changes as well as the reversibility of chronic As(2)O(3) effects were assessed. We found that cardiac conduction and repolarization were not altered whatsoever after acute As(2)O(3) treatment at clinically relevant (1, 3, and 10 microM) and higher (30 microM) doses. Nevertheless, an extremely high concentration of As(2)O(3) (300 microM) prolonged the corrected QT interval. Subsequent to chronic As(2)O(3) administration and with 30 microM As(2)O(3) via Langendorff perfusion, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was observed (1/7, 14%). Corrected QT interval was prolonged, while basic cycle length was shortened. Significant accumulation of arsenicals in the cardiac tissue was found, but without any pathological changes. After As(2)O(3) was discontinued for 30 days, the chronic As(2)O(3) -induced electrophysiological changes improved, no ventricular arrhythmia was noted, and the tissue concentration of arsenicals decreased considerably. We therefore conclude that, although no immediate cardiac effects were discemable at clinically relevant doses, an extremely high concentration of As(2)O(3) could prolong ventricular repolarization. Chronic As(2)O(3) treatment resulted in a prolonged ventricular repolarization, in association with arsenicals accumulation and with risk of ventricular tachycardia. These chronic cardiac toxicities and the tissue accumulation of arsenicals were, however, partially reversible after cessation of As(2)O(3).","['Wu, Mei-Hwan', 'Lin, Chun-Jung', 'Chen, Chi-Long', 'Su, Ming-Jai', 'Sun, Selma Siu-Man', 'Cheng, Ann-Lii']","['Wu MH', 'Lin CJ', 'Chen CL', 'Su MJ', 'Sun SS', 'Cheng AL']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Waiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. mhwu@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cardiovascular System/*drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Rabbits', 'Tissue Distribution/drug effects/physiology']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0041008X03001273 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-008x(03)00127-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2003 Jun 15;189(3):214-20. doi: 10.1016/s0041-008x(03)00127-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining alemtuzumab with fludarabine resulted in ORs >80%. In noncomparative studies in patients with previously untreated B-CLL, subcutaneous (SC) administration of alemtuzumab alone, or IV in combination with fludarabine, was highly effective, achieving OR rates of around 90%. IV alemtuzumab was active in patients with chemotherapy-resistant/relapsed T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, with reported OR rates of 24-76%. Alemtuzumab has been incorporated in novel conditioning regimens designed to facilitate stem cell transplantation in haematological malignancies. Adverse events with alemtuzumab are predictable and manageable.

A prospective study in 132 patients].,291-8,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphoproliferative disorders include a variety of diseases which are often a diagnostic problem for clinical hematologists. AIM: To study prospectively the distribution and incidence of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders in Chile and compare them with those of other Western, Latin American and Oriental countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 132 patients were studied in a 36 months period (1999-2001), with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. A score for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was employed to differentiate it from other B-cell disorders. RESULTS: The median age was 63 years old (range 32-94). Most patients had B-cell tumors (109) and the rest (23), T-cell tumors (82% vs 18%). Forty five percent of patients with B-cell tumors had a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), while the others were disseminated lymphomas. The incidence of T-cell tumors was slightly higher than that of other Western countries. Noteworthy is that the most common of these disorders was adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), in concordance with the high HTLV-1 seroprevalence in Chile. CONCLUSIONS: A morphologic, immunophenotypic and pathological study in a large number of patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders in Chile, shows a relatively low incidence of CLL when compared to other chronic B-cell tumors and a high representation of ATLL associated to HTLV-1 infection, compared with other Western countries. The lower incidence of CLL in our study might be due to patient's selection and/or underdiagnosis of this disease as a substantial proportion of CLL are asymptomatic.","['Cabrera, Maria Elena', 'Marinov, Neda', 'Guerra, Carolina', 'Morilla, Ricardo', 'Matutes, Estella']","['Cabrera ME', 'Marinov N', 'Guerra C', 'Morilla R', 'Matutes E']","['Departamento de Medicina, Campus Oriente, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Servicio de Medicina, Hospital del Salvador, Santiago. mcabrera@mi-mail.cl']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",,2003/06/07 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/06/07 05:00'],"['2003/06/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2003 Mar;131(3):291-8.,,,,Sindromes linfoproliferativos cronicos en Chile.

Pleural fluid smears contained numerous mesothelial cells, which had ground-glass nuclei or eosinophilic nuclear inclusions. Some multinucleated giant cells were also seen. Electron microscopic examination revealed intranuclear virus particles, about 150 nm in diameter, in some mesothelial cells. Tissue samples from the skin, lungs, pleura, liver, pancreas, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, obtained at autopsy, contained many virus-infected cells.

A case report.,467-9,"BACKGROUND: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (OG) is an uncommon tumor that rarely metastasizes outside the central nervous system. Spread to the bone marrow (BM) is so rare that when it occurs in the course of follow-up of a case of OG, a disseminated second primary tumor may be a more likely possibility unless BM examination provides evidence to the contrary. Potentially misleading cytologic features of metastatic anaplastic OG can be seen in a BM touch preparation. CASE: A 50-year-old man had undergone left frontal lobectomy in September 1999 for anaplastic OG and presented seven months later with evidence, on BM scan, of focal abnormal uptake at multiple sites. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed OG secondaries, which, on the touch preparation, appeared not only in clusters but also as single cells, simulating acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: The morphology of anaplastic OG metastatic to BM simulates acute leukemia, as seen on the BM touch preparation. This is relevant particularly in the context of anaplastic OG on follow-up. This diagnostic pitfall can be heightened if a BM aspirate rather than biopsy is performed.

To clarify whether homocysteine has potential carcinogenicity, we investigated formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is known to be correlated with the incidence of cancer, induced by homocysteine in human cultured cell lines. Homocysteine increased the amount of 8-oxodG in human leukemia cell line HL-60, whereas the amount of 8-oxodG in its hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-resistant clone HP100 was not increased. We investigated the mechanism for oxidative DNA damage by homocysteine using (32)P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from human tumor suppressor genes and a proto-oncogene. There were two mechanisms by which homocysteine caused DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II). A low concentration of homocysteine (20 microM) frequently induced piperidine-labile sites at thymine residues, whereas a high concentration of homocysteine (100 microM) resulted in damage principally to guanine residues. Catalase inhibited DNA damage by 20 microM homocysteine, indicating the participation of H(2)O(2), but was ineffective in preventing DNA damage by 100 microM homocysteine. Experiments using a singlet oxygen probe showed that 100 microM homocysteine enhanced chemiluminescence intensity in deuterium oxide more than that in H(2)O. These results indicated that the metal-dependent DNA damage through H(2)O(2) is likely to be a more relevant mechanism for homocysteine carcinogenicity.","['Oikawa, Shinji', 'Murakami, Katsuhiko', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Oikawa S', 'Murakami K', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrenes)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', ""93265-41-9 ((2'-methoxyvinyl)pyrene)"", 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Copper/metabolism', 'Cysteine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Homocysteine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Measurements', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrenes/analysis/metabolism', 'Singlet Oxygen/metabolism', 'Thymine/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/physiology']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206440 [doi]', '1206440 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jun 5;22(23):3530-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206440.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allergen characterization and standardization is usually based on the sera of allergic patients, whereas monoclonal IgE antibodies specific for clinically relevant allergens are very rare. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish IgE mAbs specific for birch pollen allergens, because these are important inhalant allergens. METHODS: IgE-producing hybridomas were identified by using the highly sensitive rat basophilic leukemia cell mediator release assay with enhanced allergen stimulation by additional cross-linking with birch pollen-specific IgG antibodies. The obtained IgE mAbs were characterized by immunologic methods and by cDNA sequencing. RESULTS: Seven IgE mAbs specific for the birch pollen allergens Bet v 1 or Bet v 6 were obtained and were all biologically active in mast cell-based assays. Mediator release experiments with mAb combinations indicated that 2 different epitope regions were recognized on Bet v 1, whereas the 2 Bet v 6-specific mAbs bound to the same epitope region. After sensitization of rat basophilic leukemia cells with IgE mAbs, different amounts of Bet v 1 or Bet v 6 were detected in commercial diagnostic allergen reagents, whereas sensitization with polyclonal IgE resulted in similar allergenic potency of all products.

All these chimeras have the 4070A amphotropic receptor-binding region flanked by various lengths of Moloney ecotropic N- and C-terminal Env. A charged residue, E49 (E16 on the mature protein), was identified at the N-terminals of Moloney MuLV SU that is important for the interaction with the C-terminal domain of the SU. The region that interacts with E49 was localized between junction 4 (R265 of M-MuLV Env) and junction 6 (L374 of M-MuLV Env) of SU. Sequencing the viable chimeric Env virus populations identified residues within the SU protein that improved the replication kinetics of the input chimeric Env viruses. Mutations in the C-domain of SU (G387E/R, L435I, L442P) were found to improve chimera IV4, which displayed a delayed onset of replication. The replication of AE6, containing a chimeric junction in the SU C-terminus, was improved by mutations in the N-domain (N40H, E80K), the proline-rich region (Q252R), or the transmembrane protein (L538N).

Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and migration into dermis are essential steps for infiltration of foam cells. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of adhesion molecules contributing to the process of monocyte adhesion to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). Special attention was paid to the signal transduction for adhesion molecule expression induced by two distinct types of oxidized LDL. METHODS: HDMEC were incubated with xanthoma tissue-modified LDL (x-LDL), a model of extravasated LDL oxidized in xanthoma lesions, or Cu(2+)-treated LDL (Cu-LDL), a model of oxidized LDL. Adhesion of U937 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, to HDMEC and expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules on HDMEC were examined. Signal transduction pathways for the adhesion molecule expression were evaluated by employing specific inhibitors. RESULTS: x-LDL induced adhesion of U937 cells to HDMEC through vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin by activating tyrosine kinase pathway. Cu-LDL up-regulated the adhesion through not only VCAM-1 and E-selectin but also intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by activating G(i) protein pathway. CONCLUSION: Extravasated and oxidized LDL in xanthoma lesions contributes to foam cell recruitment by activating tyrosine kinase pathway and inducing adhesion of monocytes to HDMEC through VCAM-1 and E-selectin. Cu-LDL, on the other hand, activates G(i) protein pathway and induces the adhesion through ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin.","['Matsumoto, Masaaki', 'Ikeda, Mitsunori', 'Seike, Masahiro', 'Kodama, Hajime']","['Matsumoto M', 'Ikeda M', 'Seike M', 'Kodama H']","['Department of Dermatology, Kochi Medical School, Okohcho, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. matsumo@kochi-ms.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Dermatol Sci,Journal of dermatological science,9011485,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Copper/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Microcirculation', 'Skin/*blood supply', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism', 'Xanthomatosis/*metabolism/pathology']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0923181103000288 [pii]', '10.1016/s0923-1811(03)00028-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dermatol Sci. 2003 Jun;32(1):43-54. doi: 10.1016/s0923-1811(03)00028-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two 3D-QSAR approaches were applied-CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) and CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity indices analysis). Both, neutral and protonated forms of the compounds were investigated. Molecular models with good predictive power were derived using a hydrophobic field alone and a combination of steric, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond acceptor fields of the compounds. In the combined models highest contribution of the hydrogen bond acceptor field was noticed. Thus, the dominant role of the hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields for MDR reversing activity of the investigated compounds was demonstrated.

At a low concentration, 10(-7)M, TPT increased superoxide production by differentiated HL-60 cells stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OZ) by about 45% and increased expression of CD18, a component of the OZ-receptor, by about 90%. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that TPT augmented the expression not only of CD18 but also of components of superoxide-generating NADPH-oxidase, p47phox, 2.7-fold, and p67phox, 2.0-fold, and of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), 3.0-fold, whereas various other endocrine disruptors, including parathion, vinclozolin, and bisphenol A, had no such enhancing effects. The results of a DNA macroarray analysis showed that TPT enhanced the expression of G-CSFR and certain other neutrophil functional proteins, including CD14 and myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL-1), and that TPT induced a decrease in expression of LC-PTP, leukocyte protein-tyrosine phosphatase, to about half the control level. The TPT-dependent suppression of LC-PTP was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis, and the results of immunoblotting indicated that TPT enhances the expression of myeloid specific tyrosine kinase hck by about 30% at the protein level, and this together with the reduction of LC-PTP may enhance tyrosine phosphorylation, in turn resulting in enhancement of superoxide production. These findings suggest that TPT may have an enhancing effect on the neutrophilic maturation of leukocytes.","['Watanabe, Hidemi', 'Adachi, Reiko', 'Hirayama, Akiko', 'Kasahara, Tadashi', 'Suzuki, Kazuhiro']","['Watanabe H', 'Adachi R', 'Hirayama A', 'Kasahara T', 'Suzuki K']","['National Institute of Health Sciences, 18-1 Kamiyoga 1-chome, Setagaya-ku, 158-8501, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Organotin Compounds)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '95T92AGN0V (triphenyltin)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['CD18 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Environmental Pollutants/toxicity', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Organotin Compounds/*toxicity', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03009148 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00914-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Jun 20;306(1):26-31. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00914-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first member of this family to be identified was the Drosophila regulatory gene runt, which was named by virtue of its function in establishing segmentation patterns during embryogenesis, and subsequently discovered to have additional functions in sex determination and neurogenesis. A second Drosophila Runx gene, lozenge, is required for cell patterning in the eye and for hematopoiesis. The genome project has revealed the existence of two additional Drosophila Runx genes, which to date have not been functionally characterized. Other invertebrate species with well-characterized Runx transcription factors include the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, each of which apparently contains only a single Runx gene. There are three Runx genes in mammals; Runx1 is required for definitive hematopoiesis and is a frequently mutated gene in human leukemia, Runx2 is required for osteogenesis and is associated with cleidocranial dysplasia, and Runx3 controls neurogenesis in the dorsal root ganglia and cell proliferation in the gastric epithelium, and is frequently deleted or silenced in human gastric cancer. Studies using mammalian systems and sea urchins indicate that Runx proteins have essential functions in both cell proliferation and differentiation, and in mammals they are both proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Thus, a central question concerning the cell biology of Runx proteins is how are the opposing functions of this class of transcription factors regulated during development? Here I review current knowledge of Runx protein structure, function and regulation, and outline directions for future research aimed at understanding how Runx protein function is modulated during the transition from cell proliferation to differentiation in animal development.","['Coffman, James A']",['Coffman JA'],"['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, 1000 E. 50th Street, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA. jac@stowers-institute.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (runx1 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (runx3 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family/physiology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/physiology']",90,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1065699503000180 [pii]', '10.1016/s1065-6995(03)00018-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2003;27(4):315-24. doi: 10.1016/s1065-6995(03)00018-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we found that activity of dCK can be enhanced by incubating primary cultures of lymphocytes with substrate analogues of the enzyme, as well as with various genotoxic agents. Here we present evidence that exposure of human lymphocytes to 0.5-2 Gy dosage of gamma-radiation as well as incubation of cells with calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, both elevate dCK activity without changing the level of dCK protein. When cells were gamma-irradiated in the presence of calyculin A, a more pronounced activation of dCK was observed. In contrast, both basal and stimulated dCK activities were reduced by hyperosmotic treatment of the cells. DNA repair determined by the Comet assay and by thymidine incorporation was induced by irradiation. Complete repair of gamma-irradiated DNA was detected within 1 hr following the irradiation along with dCK activation, but the rate of repair was not accelerated by calyculin A. These data provide evidence for the activation of dCK upon DNA damage and repair that seems to be mediated by phosphorylation of the enzyme, suggesting the role of dCK in DNA repair processes.","['Csapo, Zsolt', 'Keszler, Gergely', 'Safrany, Geza', 'Spasokoukotskaja, Tatjana', 'Talianidis, Iannis', 'Staub, Maria', 'Sasvari-Szekely, Maria']","['Csapo Z', 'Keszler G', 'Safrany G', 'Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Talianidis I', 'Staub M', 'Sasvari-Szekely M']","['Institute of Medical Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Pathobiochemistry, Semmelweis University, P.O.

Cells were stably transfected with a plasmid containing a chimeric DNA construct encoding a temperature-sensitive p53 variant (135(ala-->val)), which transactivates at 32 degrees but is non-functional at 37 degrees. A significant reduction in the S-phase population was observed in ptsp53 mutants incubated at 32 degrees. Nevertheless, while vector controls did not exhibit differential sensitivity to ara-C at 32 degrees versus 37 degrees, temperature-sensitive p53 mutants displayed a significant increase in apoptosis at the permissive temperature. This was not accompanied by increased ara-CTP formation, DNA incorporation of [3H]ara-C, or altered expression of Bcl-2 or Bax. Enhanced sensitivity was associated with increased mitochondrial injury (e.g. cytochrome c release), caspase activation, and loss of clonogenic survival. Significantly, ptsp53 cells synchronized in S phase were markedly more sensitive to ara-C-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis at 32 degrees, indicating that wild-type p53 specifically enhances the susceptibility of this subpopulation to ara-C lethality. Consistent with these results, transient transfection of human wild-type p53 cDNA rendered parental U937 cells more sensitive to ara-C-mediated cell death. Collectively, these findings indicate that p53 expression renders S-phase U937 cells more susceptible to ara-C-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, apoptosis, and loss of clonogenic survival without enhancing ara-C metabolism. Such findings raise the possibility that loss of functional p53 activity allows leukemia cells to circumvent ara-C lethality.","['Decker, Roy H', 'Levin, Jay', 'Kramer, Lora B', 'Dai, Yun', 'Grant, Steven']","['Decker RH', 'Levin J', 'Kramer LB', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Genes, p53/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203001497 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00149-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Jun 15;65(12):1997-2008. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00149-7.,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism. Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that Henna and HNQ pose no genotoxic risk to the consumer.","['Kirkland, David', 'Marzin, Daniel']","['Kirkland D', 'Marzin D']","['Covance Laboratories Ltd., Otley Road, Harrogate, North Yorkshire HG3 1PY, UK. david.kirkland@covance.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'TLH4A6LV1W (lawsone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/drug effects/genetics/pathology', '*Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', '*Naphthoquinones/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571803000779 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(03)00077-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2003 Jun 6;537(2):183-99. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(03)00077-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that one of them, encoding the homeoprotein Nanog, was capable of maintaining ES cell self-renewal independently of LIF/Stat3. nanog-deficient ICM failed to generate epiblast and only produced parietal endoderm-like cells. nanog-deficient ES cells lost pluripotency and differentiated into extraembryonic endoderm lineage.

Overall, these three categories were significantly correlated with age of onset, anatomical sites, the level of expression of cytotoxic molecules and CD45RO, and association with Epstein-Barr virus. This concept might provide a new insight enabling further understanding of the interrelationships among WHO T/NK-cell disease entities.","['Ichimura, Koichi', 'Kagami, Yoshitoyo', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Kojima, Masaru', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Koike, Koichi', 'Kondo, Eisei', 'Taji, Hirofumi', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Akagi, Tadaatsu', 'Takahashi, Toshitada', 'Nakamura, Shigeo']","['Ichimura K', 'Kagami Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Kojima M', 'Yoshino T', 'Ohshima K', 'Koike K', 'Kondo E', 'Taji H', 'Ogura M', 'Morishima Y', 'Akagi T', 'Takahashi T', 'Nakamura S']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1)', '0 (TIA1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granzymes', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', '*Proteins', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1', '*World Health Organization']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['1479 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1827.2003.01479.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2003 Jun;53(6):333-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1827.2003.01479.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much less is known about the role the more recently described Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 might play in tumor biology and resistance to chemotherapy. Using an antisense strategy, we here address this issue in melanoma, a paradigm of a treatment-resistant malignancy. After in vitro proof of principle supporting an antisense mechanism of action with specific reduction of Mcl-1 protein as a consequence of nuclear uptake of the Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides employed, antisense and universal control oligonucleotides were administered systemically in combination with dacarbazine in a human melanoma SCID mouse xenotransplantation model. Dacarbazine, available now for more than three decades, still remains the most active single agent for treatment of advanced melanoma. Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides specifically reduced target protein expression as well as the apoptotic threshold of melanoma xenotransplants. Combined Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotide plus dacarbazine treatment resulted in enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and led to a significantly reduced mean tumor weight (mean 0.16 g, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.26) compared to the tumor weight in universal control oligonucleotide plus dacarbazine treated animals (mean 0.35 g, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.44) or saline plus dacarbazine treated animals (mean 0.39 g, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.53). We thus show that Mcl-1 is an important factor contributing to the chemoresistance of human melanoma in vivo. Antisense therapy against the Mcl-1 gene product, possibly in combination with antisense strategies targeting other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, appears to be a rational and promising approach to help overcome treatment resistance of malignant melanoma.","['Thallinger, Christiane', 'Wolschek, Markus F', 'Wacheck, Volker', 'Maierhofer, Helmut', 'Gunsberg, Patrick', 'Polterauer, Peter', 'Pehamberger, Hubert', 'Monia, Brett P', 'Selzer, Edgar', 'Wolff, Klaus', 'Jansen, Burkhard']","['Thallinger C', 'Wolschek MF', 'Wacheck V', 'Maierhofer H', 'Gunsberg P', 'Polterauer P', 'Pehamberger H', 'Monia BP', 'Selzer E', 'Wolff K', 'Jansen B']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Section of Experimental Oncology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Dacarbazine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/07/17 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)30299-2 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12252.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2003 Jun;120(6):1081-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12252.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the role of PSA-NCAM in the survival of oxytocin (OT)- and vasopressin (VP)-producing magnocellular cells of this system. We used a recently developed organotypic slice culture model of the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in which ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are potent survival factors for magnocellular neurons. We demonstrate by means of confocal microscopy that cultured magnocellular VP and OT neurons express strong immunoreactivity for PSA-NCAM. Removal of PSA from NCAM by the enzyme Endo N leads to a significant loss of both VP and OT neurons in the presence of low concentrations of CNTF. Endo N treatment did not change cell survival in the presence of LIF. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in neuro-glial plasticity, PSA-NCAM might also influence the trophic factor responsiveness of hypothalamic VP and OT neurosecretory cells.","['Vutskits, L', 'Gascon, E', 'Kiss, J Z']","['Vutskits L', 'Gascon E', 'Kiss JZ']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Surgical Intensive Care, University Hospital of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (polysialyl neural cell adhesion molecule)', '11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)', '50-56-6 (Oxytocin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.129 (endo-alpha-sialidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1/*metabolism', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Neuronal Plasticity/physiology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Oxytocin/biosynthesis', 'Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus/*cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism', 'Vasopressins/biosynthesis']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['2660 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02660.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 2003 May;17(10):2119-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02660.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the disease is commonly thought of as indolent, most patients eventually require therapy because of recurrent infections secondary to neutropenia as well as a need for frequent blood product transfusions. CD26 is a 110-kDa surface glycoprotein with an essential role in T-cell function, including being a marker of T-cell activation and a mediator of T-cell activating signals. In this study, we evaluated CD26 expression in T-LGL patients and correlate CD26 expression with clinical behaviour. In addition, we examined the potential mechanism of cytopenia that is associated with this disorder. Our findings suggest that CD26 is a marker of aggressive T-LGL LPD and that CD26-related signalling may be aberrant in T-LGL LPD. Furthermore, inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units may be mediated by CD8+ cells of T-LGL LPD patients and is major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted.","['Dang, Nam H', 'Aytac, Ugur', 'Sato, Kazuya', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Melenhorst, Jos', 'Morimoto, Chikao', 'Barrett, A John', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Dang NH', 'Aytac U', 'Sato K', ""O'Brien S"", 'Melenhorst J', 'Morimoto C', 'Barrett AJ', 'Molldrem JJ']","['University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",,2003/06/06 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/06/06 05:00'],"['2003/06/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['4365 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04365.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Jun;121(6):857-65. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04365.x.,,,"['CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 81247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive early chronic-phase CML were treated with the combination of PEG-IFN-alpha-2b and ara-C (10 mg daily subcutaneously [s.c.]). The starting dose of PEG-IFN-alpha-2b was 6 microg/kg s.c. weekly in the first 24 patients but was reduced to 4.5 microg/kg in the next 52 patients. RESULTS: Overall, 73% of patients had a complete hematologic response, 35% of patients had a major cytogenetic response (Ph < 35%), and 21% of patients had a complete cytogenetic response (Ph = 0%). With a median follow-up of 19 months, the estimated 2-year survival rate was 89%. Therapy was discontinued in 24% of patients due to Grade III-IV toxicity. Frequent severe side effects that required dose reductions included neutropenia (49%), fatigue (43%), and neurologic toxicity (17%). The median PEG-IFN-alpha-2b and ara-C doses delivered were 3 microg/kg weekly and 7.5 mg daily, respectively, at 12 months of therapy.

The recent directive from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to adopt the 2000 U.S. standard population for the age adjustment of death rates prompted the American Cancer Society to update historical cancer mortality statistics using the new standard. METHODS: Mortality data were abstracted by race, gender, year, and age at death for 1930 through 1959 from annual volumes of Vital Statistics of the United States. For 1960 through 1998, these data were obtained from data tapes provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. Two U.S. standard million populations (1970 and 2000) were used to calculate age-adjusted rates. Average annual percent change was estimated for each decade by site, gender, and age, and the statistical significance of the change was assessed at p < 0.05. RESULTS: After long-term increases or mostly level trends that date from the 1930s for some sites, death rates for cancers of the lung (in males), prostate, female breast, colon-rectum, pancreas, leukemia, and ovary were decreasing in the 1990s. Liver cancer death rates were increasing in the 1990s. Throughout the study period, death rates for female lung cancer increased, while death rates for stomach and uterine cancers declined. CONCLUSIONS: The trends of decreasing cancer death rates for the leading cancer sites in the 1990s are encouraging.

In the nucleus, the intracellular domain of teneurin-2 colocalizes with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in nuclear bodies implicated in transcription control. Since Drosophila ten-m acts epistatically to another pair-rule gene opa, we investigated whether gene regulation by the mammalian opa homologue zic-1 was influenced by the intracellular domain of teneurin-2. We found that zic-mediated transcription from the apolipoprotein E promoter was inhibited. Release of the intracellular domain of teneurin-2 could be stimulated by homophilic interaction of the extracellular domain, and the intracellular domain was stabilized by proteasome inhibitors. We have previously shown that teneurin-2 is expressed by neurons belonging to the same functional circuit. Therefore, we hypothesize that homophilic interaction enables neurons to identify their targets and that the release of the intracellular domain of teneurin-2 provides them with a signal to switch their gene expression program from growth towards differentiation once the proper contact has been made.","['Bagutti, Claudia', 'Forro, Gaby', 'Ferralli, Jacqueline', 'Rubin, Beatrix', 'Chiquet-Ehrismann, Ruth']","['Bagutti C', 'Forro G', 'Ferralli J', 'Rubin B', 'Chiquet-Ehrismann R']","['Friedrich Miescher Institute, Novartis Forschungsstiftung, PO Box 2543, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (ZIC1 protein, human)', '0 (teneurin-2 protein, chicken)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apolipoproteins E/genetics', 'Avian Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/04/08 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/jcs.00603 [doi]', 'jcs.00603 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2003 Jul 15;116(Pt 14):2957-66. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00603.

This report describes the interpretation of atypical signal patterns encountered using BCR-ABL dual colour dual fusion fluorescence in situ hybridisation (D-FISH) translocation probes in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). METHODS: Interphase FISH experiments were carried out using BCR-ABL D-FISH probes in 46 patients with CML at diagnosis and during subsequent disease monitoring. Atypical hybridisation signal patterns were characterised by molecular cytogenetic techniques and correlated with conventional karyotyping. RESULTS: Two patients showed atypical interphase D-FISH patterns with one orange, one green, and one fusion (1O1G1F) signal. The presence of BCR-ABL gene fusion was documented by a dual colour single fusion (S-FISH) probe. The submicroscopic deletion of the ABL-BCR fusion gene on the derivative chromosome 9 in these cases was subsequently characterised by metaphase FISH on relocated G banded metaphases. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical interphase D-FISH patterns should not be interpreted in isolation and should be considered in conjunction with other cytogenetic or molecular genetic investigations.","['Wan, T S K', 'Ma, S K', 'Au, W Y', 'Chan, L C']","['Wan TS', 'Ma SK', 'Au WY', 'Chan LC']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.56.6.471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2003 Jun;56(6):471-4. doi: 10.1136/jcp.56.6.471.,,,,,,,,,PMC1769964,,,,,,,

Changes in intracellular calcium level are important in T-cell activation. In this study the effect of the synthetic &#x03B4;-opioid agonist DADLE and an endogenous &#x03B4;-opioid pentapeptide Met-enkephalin on the intracellular calcium level in human T-lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells is reported. Intracellular calcium level was monitored using QUIN 2-AM as a fluorescent dye in MOLT-4 cells after short treatment (2 and 15 min) with DADLE and Met-enkephalin. DADLE (10<sup>-8</sup>M) mildly (average 28&#x0025;) decreased the intracellular calcium level after 1 min treatment. The suppressive effect of DADLE (10<sup>-8</sup>M) on the intracellular calcium level was enhanced by longer (15 min) treatment of MOLT-4 cells (average 40&#x0025;). Met-enkephalin (10<sup>-9</sup>M - 10<sup>-7</sup>M) decreased (average 33 &#x0025;) the intracellular calcium level after 2 min treatment (average 33&#x0025; - 37&#x0025;).

Ionophore A23187 (10<sup>-7</sup>M, 10<sup>-6</sup>M) was used as a positive control to enhance intracellular calcium level. Thus, &#x03B4;-opioid agonist DADLE decreased basal intracellular calcium level in MOLT-4 cells after short treatment, while endogenous Met-enkephalin altered intracellular calcium level in a bidirectional way by decreasing and increasing it.","['Martin - Kleiner, I', 'Gabrilovac, J']","['Martin - Kleiner I', 'Gabrilovac J']","['Ruder Boskovic Institute, Division of Molecular Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,,,,,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['1 [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 1999 Sep-Dec;12(3):113-119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the available data, it seems reasonable to conclude that this exciting new agent is the best primary treatment for the newly diagnosed chronic-phase patient who is not immediately eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). However, the definition of response or failure to respond is not straightforward and the extent to which imatinib prolongs life when used as a single agent cannot yet be estimated with any accuracy. This means that decisions on how best to continue treatment can be extremely difficult. Moreover, the decision whether and when to offer the patient treatment by allo-SCT has become especially complicated in the last 2 years. Imatinib seems to be generally less effective when used to treat patients in advanced phases of CML, although some patients treated in accelerated phase may achieve prolonged disease control. It is likely that the role of imatinib, used alone or in combination with other agents, will be more clearly defined in the near future.","['Goldman, John M', 'Marin, David', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Apperley, Jane F']","['Goldman JM', 'Marin D', 'Olavarria E', 'Apperley JF']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London at Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Management', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",34,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50049 [doi]', 'S0037196303000829 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Apr;40(2 Suppl 2):98-103; discussion 104-13. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50049.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In vitro studies examining the effects of imatinib plus cytarabine (Ara-C) using CML cell lines and colony-forming assays of CML patient samples have shown synergistic antiproliferative effects of this combination. Thus several groups decided to investigate this new combination with the hypothesis that cell resistance would be less frequent. The CML French Group performed a phase II trial to determine the safety and tolerability of a combination of imatinib and Ara-C for previously untreated patients with chronic-phase CML.

Point mutations occurring in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL have been identified as a cause of imatinib resistance. These mutations can be categorized into two groups: (1) mutations directly impairing the binding of imatinib but not ATP, and (2) mutations occurring in the ATP phosphate binding loop (P loop) or activation loop preventing the kinase to achieve conformation required for imatinib binding. Functional analysis of mutant BCR-ABL alleles in vitro has demonstrated four mutations (Q252H, F317L,M351T, E355G) to confer moderate resistance to imatinib, while T315I-, E255K-, Y253F-, and G250E-expressing cells are markedly resistant. Assay sensitivities and patient selection will affect the frequency of mutation detection. Another possible explanation for imatinib resistance is that mutated BCR-ABL-expressing cells might pre-exist the onset of treatment at levels below threshold detection (<20%), then expand under selective pressure of imatinib treatment. Rare mutated cells were identified using a very sensitive allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) assay in pretreatment samples of five CML patients supporting the theory that point mutations pre-existed imatinib treatment. Imatinib-resistant patients may benefit from molecular genotyping so mutations can be identified and clinical therapy adjusted accordingly.","['Roche-Lestienne, Catherine', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Roche-Lestienne C', 'Preudhomme C']","[""Unite Inserm U524, Lille; and the Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, CHRU, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",16,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50046 [doi]', 'S0037196303000799 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Apr;40(2 Suppl 2):80-2. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50046.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Despite significant hematologic and cytogenetic responses, resistance occurs in patients with chronic phase (CP) and advanced disease. A cohort of 72 patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis (BC) (n = 34), lymphoid BC (n = 2), accelerated phase (AP) (n = 16), CP (n = 18), and BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 2) resistant to imatinib were investigated. Median levels of BCR-ABL transcripts, determined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were not significantly changed at the time of resistance, but seven of 55 patients showed a greater than 10-fold increase in BCR-ABL levels. Genomic amplification of BCR-ABL was found in two of 32 patients evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additional chromosomal aberrations were observed in 19 of 36 patients and point mutations of the ABL tyrosine kinase domain resulting in reactivation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase were detected in 29 of 72 patients. Resistance may be caused by BCR-ABL-independent or BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms. A thorough evaluation of resistant cases is required to suggest therapeutic measures in the individual case. Clonal selection of resistant cells harboring a BCR-ABL mutation might be reversed by stopping imatinib therapy and switching to chemotherapy. Combination therapy from the start of treatment to reduce the frequency of resistance is currently being evaluated with several drugs.","['Hochhaus, Andreas']",['Hochhaus A'],"['III Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50045 [doi]', 'S0037196303000787 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Apr;40(2 Suppl 2):69-79. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50045.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In chronic-phase patients it induces significantly better cytogenetic responses and lower progression rates than interferon-alpha. However, relapse is a significant problem, especially for advanced-phase patients, and imatinib alone appears unlikely to be curative in any patient group. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) provides an accurate, sensitive, and noninvasive measure of residual leukemia in patients on imatinib. Levels of BCR-ABL in the blood correlate strongly with the bone marrow cytogenetic results and early measurement can predict subsequent cytogenetic response. Complete molecular responses (no BCR-ABL detected by real-time Q-PCR) are rarely achieved. Sequential real-time Q-PCR studies should facilitate rational patient management and allow comparison of different imatinib-based treatment strategies.

We analyzed gene expression profiles of peripheral leukemia cells from 18 CML patients (16 chronic phase, two blast crisis) who were treated with imatinib alone. cDNA microarrays representing 23,040 genes identified 79 genes that were expressed differentially between cytogenetically defined responders and nonresponders to imatinib. We then established a ""prediction score"" system using 15 or 30 of these genes that could clearly separate the responder group from the nonresponder group. Four additional patients' responses to imatinib were successfully predicted, validating the process.

Its origins in the hematopoietic stem cell can be traced to a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22, dubbed the Philadelphia chromosome, which is observed in essentially all patients. The resulting fusion gene, BCR/ABL, encodes an activated tyrosine kinase that can act alone to induce a CML-like syndrome in mouse models. These animal models have validated BCR/ABL as a target for the development of specific pharmaceutical inhibitors. The kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is highly specific, effective, and minimally toxic, but may not effect cures as a single agent, particularly in patients with accelerated and blast-phase disease. Resistance to imatinib can confound therapy. Surprisingly, a high percentage of resistant cases manifest intact or augmented BCR/ABL signaling, suggesting that this oncoprotein, or signaling pathways emanating from it, remain viable targets. Combination chemotherapy is under active investigation, and among the most compelling strategies is dual treatment with agents that both target BCR/ABL signal transduction. BCR/ABL activates Ras, and compounds designed to antagonize Ras function called farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) have shown potent activity in vitro and in animal models of BCR/ABL-induced leukemia. Initial clinical trials in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and CML in blast crisis have shown significant activity, suggesting that trials combining imatinib and FTIs are warranted.","['Daley, George Q']",['Daley GQ'],"[""Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, and the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02142, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",29,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50035 [doi]', 'S0037196303000684 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Apr;40(2 Suppl 2):11-4. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50035.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The CXCR4/SDF-1 system appears to be important for tissue localization and increased survival of B-CLL cells. The aim of our study was to examine if CXCR4 expression and SDF-1 blood levels were correlated to clinical and pathological stage of B-CLL. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques were used to determine CXCR4 expression and SDF-1 plasma levels, respectively, in a cohort of 51 patients diagnosed with B-CLL to correlate these measurements with several parameters that define the clinical stage of the disease. We confirmed that CXCR4 was consistently expressed on circulating B-CLL cells with a fluorescence intensity that was five-fold greater than in cells from healthy volunteers. There was a correlation between CXCR4 expression and leukocyte count ( r: 0.55, p<0.01), and CD19(+)/CD5(+ )cells ( r: 0.63, p<0.01). Interestingly, the group of B-CLL patients showed lower SDF-1 plasma levels compared to the control group. However, there was no correlation between CXCR4 or SDF-1 expression and the clinical stage of disease or the pattern of bone marrow infiltration. The results obtained suggest that other factors, and not only alteration in the SDF-1/CXCR4 chemokine system, must account for marrow infiltration of neoplastic cells observed in B-CLL and that CXCR4 could be involved in other features that exhibit malignant B cells, such as increased survival, rather than in their homing or migration to the bone marrow.","['Barretina, J', 'Junca, J', 'Llano, A', 'Gutierrez, A', 'Flores, A', 'Blanco, J', 'Clotet, B', 'Este, J A']","['Barretina J', 'Junca J', 'Llano A', 'Gutierrez A', 'Flores A', 'Blanco J', 'Clotet B', 'Este JA']","['Retrovirology Laboratory irsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Retrovirology Laboratory irsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Retrovirology Laboratory irsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Retrovirology Laboratory irsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Retrovirology Laboratory irsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Retrovirology Laboratory irsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08916, Badalona, Spain. jaeste@ns.hugtip.scs.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CCL5/blood', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/10/01 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-003-0679-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-003-0679-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2003 Aug;82(8):500-505. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0679-0.

METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of all available records of patients with chronic MPD presenting to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between October 1998 and May 2002, treated with imatinib mesylate combined with anagrelide. RESULTS: Of 22 patients identified, 18 had Ph-positive CML (chronic phase, 16 patients; accelerated phase, 2 patients), 1 had agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), 2 had essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 1 had MPD transformed into refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). The median age was 57 years (range 26-82 years). The median dose of imatinib mesylate administered was 400 mg (range 300-800 mg) and the median dose of anagrelide was 1.5 mg (range 0.5-4.0 mg). Imatinib mesylate and anagrelide combination therapy was feasible and tolerable. Of the 18 patients with Ph-positive CML, 15 in chronic phase and 1 in accelerated phase achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR), and 9 of the 18 achieved cytogenetic response (complete in 8 patients).

Patients received FCA (fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) i.v. daily for 3 days, cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m(2) i.v. daily for 3 days, and amifostine 500 mg i.v. over 15 min daily for 3 days starting 30 min before cyclophosphamide) at intervals of 4-6 weeks for a maximum of six courses. RESULTS: Patients receiving FCA had equivalent rates of sepsis, early death, objective response and survival to those observed in a prior series of 78 patients treated with FC. Amifostine-associated toxicities included nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. CONCLUSION: The study amifostine regimen did not reduce the toxicity or activity of the FC regimen in patients with CLL.","['Giles, Francis J', 'Shi, Gary Guangping', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Keating, Anna R', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan M""]","['Giles FJ', 'Shi GG', 'Cortes JE', 'Thomas D', 'Keating AR', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien SM""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Sepsis/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2002/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0654-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Sep;52(3):223-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0654-4.

Histologically, cutaneous B-LBLs may be confused with other small round-cell neoplasms. Moreover, half of B-LBL patients are negative for CD45 (leucocyte common antigen, LCA), a widely used marker for the diagnosis of lymphoma, and a significant portion express CD99, a marker for Ewing's sarcoma (ES) or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Therefore, an extranodal B-LBL may be misinterpreted as PNET or ES. Here, we report on 2 boys, aged 10 and 5 years, with primary cutaneous B-LBL of the scalp. PNET was initially misdiagnosed because the tumor cells were negative for CD45 but strongly positive for CD99. Advanced stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed later and both patients died during the course of treatment for ALL. In retrospective analyses, tumor cells in the initial biopsy specimens of both patients were found to be reactive to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD43 and CD10. Thus, the diagnosis of B-LBL was confirmed. These cases illustrate the possibility that primary cutaneous B-LBL may mimic ES or PNET immunophenotypically, and that correct diagnosis in doubtful cases may be facilitated by analysis using a complete panel of antibodies, particularly including TdT and CD43.","['Hsiao, Cheng-Hsiang', 'Su, Ih-Jen']","['Hsiao CH', 'Su IJ']","['Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/*diagnosis', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*diagnosis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2003 Mar;102(3):193-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exaggerated levels of LIF have also been detected in the adult respiratory distress syndrome and other disorders. The biologic effects of LIF in the lung, however, have not been elucidated. To define the respiratory effects of LIF, we generated transgenic mice in which human LIF was selectively targeted to the mature lung. In these mice, transgene activation caused an impressive increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity with a significant increase in BAL and tissue B lymphocytes. LIF also conferred protection in 100% O2 where it decreased alveolar-capillary protein leak and enhanced survival. This protective effect was associated with the induction of interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein. LIF transgenic mice with a null mutation in IL-6 were more sensitive to the toxic effects of 100% O2 than LIF-transgenic animals with a wild-type IL-6 locus. These studies demonstrate that LIF induces B cell hyperplasia and confers protection in hyperoxic acute lung injury. They also demonstrate that LIF induces IL-6 and that the protective effects of LIF are mediated, in part, via this inductive event.

The basis for such associations remains unexplained. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents approximately three-quarters of all U.S. leukemia types. Some risk factors for childhood leukemia have been established, and others are suspected. Pathogenesis, as investigated in animal models, is consistent with the multistep model of acute leukemia development. Studies of carcinogenicity in animals, however, are overwhelmingly negative and do not support the hypothesis that EMF exposure is a significant risk factor for hematopoietic neoplasia. We may fail to observe effects from EMFs because, from a mechanistic perspective, the effects of EMFs on biology are very weak. Cells and organs function despite many sources of chemical ""noise"" (e.g., stochastic, temperature, concentration, mechanical, and electrical noise), which exceed the induced EMF ""signal"" by a large factor. However, the inability to detect EMF effects in bioassay systems may be caused by the choice made for ""EMF exposure."" ""Contact currents"" or ""contact voltages"" have been proposed as a novel exposure metric, because their magnitude is related to measured power-line magnetic fields. A contact current occurs when a person touches two conductive surfaces at different voltages. Modeled analyses support contact currents as a plausible metric because of correlations with residential magnetic fields and opportunity for exposure. The possible role of contact currents as an explanatory variable in the reported associations between EMFs and childhood leukemia will need to be clarified by further measurements, biophysical analyses, bioassay studies, and epidemiology.","['Brain, Joseph D', 'Kavet, Robert', 'McCormick, David L', 'Poole, Charles', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Smith, Thomas J', 'Valberg, Peter A', 'Van Etten, R A', 'Weaver, James C']","['Brain JD', 'Kavet R', 'McCormick DL', 'Poole C', 'Silverman LB', 'Smith TJ', 'Valberg PA', 'Van Etten RA', 'Weaver JC']","['Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",66,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.6020 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2003 Jun;111(7):962-70. doi: 10.1289/ehp.6020.,,,,,,,,,PMC1241532,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 26 population-based central cancer registries for 1992-1997 were used. Individual cancers were grouped into specific diagnostic groups and subgroups using an integrated classification scheme. The integrated scheme was developed for this study and was based on the most commonly used schemes in population-based epidemiologic studies: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program's site groups, International Classification of Childhood Cancer, and International Agency for Research on Cancer's Histological Groups for Comparative Studies. Percent distributions and age-specific incidence rates per million population were computed for adolescents (aged 15-19 years) and young adults (aged 20-24 years) by gender. RESULTS: The data for 26,010 cancer cases were examined. Among 15-19-year-olds, the five most common cancers were Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, cancer in the brain and other nervous system, bone cancer, and non-Hodgkin's disease. Among 20-24-year-olds, the five most common cancers were Hodgkin's disease, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma of the skin, and leukemia. The proportions and rates of the histologic subtypes for most of the common cancers changed with advancing age. For example, among 15-19-year-olds, acute lymphocytic leukemia accounted for approximately 60% of leukemias in males and 50% in females. Among 20-24-year-olds, however, the corresponding percentages of acute lymphocytic leukemia were 37% in males and 31% in females. For ovarian cancer, the germ cell tumor was the most common subtype (54.6% of all ovarian cancers) among 15-19-year-olds. In contrast, ovarian carcinoma was the predominant subtype (70.4%) among 20-24-year-olds. For both age groups, the incidence rates of nodular Hodgkin's disease, melanoma of the skin, and thyroid cancer were significantly greater in females than in males. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer incidence patterns among adolescents and young adults are distinctive. In these age groups, a transition from predominantly pediatric histologic subtypes to adult subtypes was observed for Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, ovarian cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma. Gender differences were found for Hodgkin's disease, melanoma of the skin, and thyroid cancer.","['Wu, Xiao-Cheng', 'Chen, Vivien W', 'Steele, Brooke', 'Roffers, Steven', 'Klotz, Judith B', 'Correa, Catherine N', 'Carozza, Susan E']","['Wu XC', 'Chen VW', 'Steele B', 'Roffers S', 'Klotz JB', 'Correa CN', 'Carozza SE']","['Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA. xwu@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Adolesc Health,The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,9102136,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology', '*SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1054139X03000570 [pii]', '10.1016/s1054-139x(03)00057-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Adolesc Health. 2003 Jun;32(6):405-15. doi: 10.1016/s1054-139x(03)00057-0.,,,,,,,,,,['J Adolesc Health. 2003 Jun;32(6):403-4.

Histologically, these mice exhibited hyperplasia of Langerhans islet cells; pancreatic cell regions composed of both insulin- and glucagon-producing cells. Furthermore, Bax and Bag-1 -- possible heterodimeric partners for EAT in the anti-apoptotic process -- were up-regulated in islets isolated from the EAT transgenic mice. The insulin tolerance test exhibited no significant difference between the EAT transgenic mice and non-transgenic mice, indicating that islet cell hyperplasia was not due to insulin resistance.

EAT may inhibit apoptosis of beta cells, allowing these cells to circumvent the process of apoptosis until the adult stage.","['Matsushita, Kenichi', 'Okita, Hajime', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Shimoda, Kouji', 'Fukuma, Mariko', 'Yamada, Taketo', 'Urano, Fumihiko', 'Honda, Takahiro', 'Sano, Makoto', 'Iwanaga, Shiro', 'Ogawa, Satoshi', 'Hata, Jun-ichi', 'Umezawa, Akihiro']","['Matsushita K', 'Okita H', 'Suzuki A', 'Shimoda K', 'Fukuma M', 'Yamada T', 'Urano F', 'Honda T', 'Sano M', 'Iwanaga S', 'Ogawa S', 'Hata J', 'Umezawa A']","['Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adenoma, Islet Cell/pathology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Size', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/*etiology/pathology', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Islets of Langerhans/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/05/01 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0303720703000959 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(03)00095-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2003 May 30;203(1-2):105-16. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(03)00095-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mouse genome harbors numerous copies of endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related retroviral sequences. Mouse liver tissues harvested after burn injury were subjected to RT-PCR analysis to investigate the regulation of MuLV-related sequences using a primer set capable of amplifying the full-length transcript. A doublet of approximately 5-kb was transiently up-regulated at 3 and 6 h after injury. Sequence analyses revealed that these are novel defective endogenous retroviral sequences (MuLV(LI-8) and MuLV(LI-12)), which are predominantly characterized by major deletions in pol and env genes. The MuLV(LI-8) clone is 4.85 kb long and the deduced gag polypeptide sequence was almost identical to a previously reported replication-defective retroviral sequence associated with immunesuppression. In the MuLV(LI-12) clone of 5.06 kb, there were two truncated gag open reading frames (ORFs) and 1 pol ORF fused to the C-terminus of the env p15E. Furthermore, the ORFs for the unique gag p12 presumed to be responsible for the immunesuppression were present in both clones. These novel replication-defective MuLVs may participate in the pathogenesis of distant organs after injury.","['Cho, Kiho', 'Greenhalgh, David']","['Cho K', 'Greenhalgh D']","['Burn Surgery, Shriners Hospitals for Children Northern California and Department of Surgery, University of California at Davis, 2425 Stockton Blvd, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Burns', 'Defective Viruses/classification/*genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*genetics/physiology', 'Liver/*injuries/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/08/30 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170203000972 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(03)00097-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2003 Jun;93(2):189-98. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(03)00097-2.,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY140895', 'GENBANK/AY140896']",,,,,,,,

Individual colonies were grown in methycellulose culture (clonogenic cells) and after 5 weeks, LTC (colonies derived from LTC-ICs) were individually isolated. DNA isolated from these clonogenic colonies was studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts b3a2 and b2a2. At the mature hematopoietic progenitor cell level, almost all (20/21) colonies, including both erythroid and myeloid progenitors, were leukemic, i.e. BCR/ABL mRNA positive. Although normal progenitors were able to grow in the presence of bestatin, even at the most primitive progenitor cell level (LTC-ICs), the number of leukemic clones gradually decreased. Furthermore, bestatin suppressed the outgrowth of leukemic clones more frequently than control LTC without any effect on the growth of normal clones. These results indicate that bestatin, at levels that can be obtained by per os administration clinically, suppresses only Ph-positive leukemic clones without affecting normal hematopoiesis. Based on these results, we suggest that bestatin has the potential to provide another treatment for patients with CML.","['Fujisaki, Tomoaki', 'Otsuka, Teruhisa', 'Gondo, Hisashi', 'Okamura, Takashi', 'Niho, Yoshiyuki', 'Ohhinata, Akira', 'Abe, Fuminori']","['Fujisaki T', 'Otsuka T', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura T', 'Niho Y', 'Ohhinata A', 'Abe F']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cancer Center, Kyushu University, 812, Fukuoka, Japan. tfujisaki@matsuyama.jrc.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukotriene C4/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(03)00083-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00083-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2003 Jun;3(6):901-7. doi: 10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00083-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCX-1777 is a potent inhibitor of PNP. BCX-1777 in the presence of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) inhibits the proliferation of CEM-SS [T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)] cells with an IC(50)=0.015 microM. This inhibition by BCX-1777 and dGuo is accompanied by elevation of dGTP (154-fold) and dATP (8-fold). Deoxycytidine (dCyt) completely and lamivudine (3TC) partially reverse this inhibition caused by BCX-1777 and dGuo. dNTP analysis of these samples indicates that, in the presence of dCyt, where complete reversal of inhibition is observed, dGTP and dATP pools revert back to the control levels. In samples containing 3TC, where partial reversal of inhibition was observed, dGTP decreased from 154-fold to 38-fold and dATP levels further increased from 8-fold to 30-fold compared to the control sample. In CEM-SS cells, inhibition of proliferation by BCX-1777 and dGuo is not due to accumulation of dATP because in the presence of 3TC, where reversal of inhibition is observed, dATP levels are further increased. These studies clearly indicate that inhibition of T cells is due to accumulation of dGTP resulting in cell death with characteristics of apoptosis. The half-life of dGTP in CEM-SS cells is 18 h, which is longer than that observed in human lymphocytes (4 h), suggesting that the nucleotidase level in CEM-SS cells is lower than in human lymphocytes. A 154-fold accumulation of dGTP in CEM-SS cells in the presence of BCX-1777 and dGuo compared to a 15-fold accumulation of dGTP in human lymphocytes suggests that kinase level is higher in CEM-SS cells compared to human lymphocytes. High kinase and low nucleotidase levels make CEM-SS cells more sensitive to inhibition by BCX-1777 and dGuo than human lymphocytes. Currently, BCX-1777 is in phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of T cell malignancies.","['Bantia, Shanta', 'Ananth, Sandya L', 'Parker, Cynthia D', 'Horn, LaShun L', 'Upshaw, Ramanda']","['Bantia S', 'Ananth SL', 'Parker CD', 'Horn LL', 'Upshaw R']","['Department of Biological Sciences, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2190 Parkway Lake Drive, Suite B, Birmingham, AL 35244, USA. sbantia@biocryst.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', 'BO9LE4QFZF (Stavudine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Stavudine/pharmacology']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(03)00076-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00076-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2003 Jun;3(6):879-87. doi: 10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00076-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), which affects the biological process of secretion, on constitutive and delayed apoptosis of neutrophils was investigated. Neutrophil apoptosis was determined after culturing for 20 h in vitro by morphological changes, annexin V staining, and DNA electrophoresis. BFA dose-dependently increased the constitutive apoptotic rate of neutrophils. The delay of apoptosis induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also blocked by BFA. However, this effect of BFA was less marked when neutrophils were treated with dexamethasone, interleukin-8 (IL-8), or dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP). Moreover, the delay of neutrophil apoptosis induced by rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, was significantly abrogated by BFA. Although BFA-induced apoptosis was not blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor, zDEVD-fmk, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression levels were downregulated by BFA.

In the present study, our aim was to evaluate whether treatment with CLB for more than one year induced genetic changes manifested by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) as new chromosomal aberrations. We also studied whether CLB affected the pattern of replication by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We found a similar rate of asynchronous pattern of replication in both treated and untreated patients with CLL. Most of the aberrations found with CGH were previously reported in CLL. More prognostically unfavorable aberrations and more cases with genetic changes were found in the treated group. The changes found were not typical of the secondary genetic aberrations associated with alkylating agents. Thus, we conclude that treatment of CLL with CLB for at least a year does not affect the parameters analyzed in this study. Longer studies are needed to further explore the effects of alkylating agents on normal and malignant cells.","['Amiel, A', 'Biton, I', 'Yukla, M', 'Gaber, E', 'Fejgin, M D', 'Lishner, M']","['Amiel A', 'Biton I', 'Yukla M', 'Gaber E', 'Fejgin MD', 'Lishner M']","['Genetic Institute, Meir Hospital, Kfar-Saba, Israel.

Models that emulate translocations are essential to understanding the determinants of frank malignancy, those dictating the restriction of translocations to specific lineages, and as a basis for development of rational therapeutic methods. We demonstrate that developmentally regulated Cre-loxP-mediated interchromosomal recombination between the Mll gene, whose human counterpart is involved in a spectrum of leukemias, and the Enl gene creates reciprocal chromosomal translocations that cause myeloid tumors. There is a rapid onset and high penetrance of leukemogenesis in these translocator mice, and high proportions of cells carrying chromosomal translocations can be found in bone marrow as early as 12 days after birth.

One hundred and thirty-five patients were accepted as de novo MDS or juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). The incidence for this period was 1.35 per million (age standardized rate) which is below that reported outside the UK. The overall survival was 45%[standard error (SE) = 4%] at 5 years: 40% (SE = 6%) for JMML and 50% (SE = 6%) for other MDS. Significant adverse prognostic factors for JMML were a platelet count < 40 x 10(9)/l, raised fetal haemoglobin, FPC score and age above 2 years at diagnosis, for other MDS only monosomy 7 was significant. To conclude, the incidence of MDS/JMML in children in the UK appears to be lower than that reported outside the UK. This may be either a real difference in incidence or variation in reporting. Monosomy 7 is associated with poor outcome in MDS other than JMML.

Between 1990 and 2000, we analysed PGP and bcl-2 by flow cytometry, using two anti-PGP (C219 and JSB-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and an anti-bcl-2 mAb in 115 de novo adult ALL patients. Both a longer overall survival (OS) and longer disease-free survival (DFS) were observed in PGP-negative patients (23%vs 0% at 3 years, P = 0.011 and 29%vs 0% at 2 years, P = 0.006 for C219 respectively; 42%vs 0% at 1.5 years, P = 0.004 and 53%vs 0% at 8.5 months, P = 0.00006 for JSB-1 respectively). Bcl-2 positivity was associated with a significantly higher complete remission rate (90%vs 66%, P = 0.01). Moreover, in 69 patients not presenting with either t(9;22) or B-mature immunophenotype, PGP negativity (JSB-1) maintained its significant favourable prognostic impact with regard to OS (41%vs 0% at 1.5 years, P = 0.009) and DFS (83%vs 0% at 6 months, P = 0.0005). Importantly, within a subset of 62 patients with normal (n = 31) or unknown (n = 31) karyotype, PGP (JSB-1)-negative patients showed both a significantly longer OS and DFS (63%vs 0% at 1.4 years, P = 0.018 and 84%vs 0% at 6 months, P = 0.001 respectively). In multivariate analysis, JSB-1 (P = 0.008) and cytogenetics (P = 0.02) were found to be independent prognostic factors with regard to DFS.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is particularly sensitive to this graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect. Several studies have shown that in allogeneic responses both CD4 and CD8 cells are capable of strong antigen-specific growth inhibition of leukaemic progenitor cells, but that CD4 cells mainly exert the GVL effect against CML. Efficient activation of allogeneic CD4 cells, as well as CD8 cells, may explain the sensitivity of CML cells to elimination by allogeneic T cells. Identification of the antigens recognized by CD4 cells is crucial in understanding the mechanism through which CML cells are so successful in activating allogeneic T cells. In the present report, we describe the characterization of an allogeneic CD4 T-cell clone, DDII.4.4. This clone was found to react against an antigen that is specifically expressed in myeloid cells, including CD34+ CML cells. The antigen recognition is restricted by HLA-DRB1*16.

However, incubation with TRAIL combined with fludarabine, cytosine arabinoside or daunorubicin resulted in additive or super-additive apoptosis induction in approximately half of the isolates. Molecular evidence of super-additive apoptosis induction by TRAIL and cytotoxic agents was obtained by quantification of caspase 3 activation, detected by Western blot analysis of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage. The ability of TRAIL and daunorubicin to induce super-additive apoptosis correlated with the ability of these agents to activate caspase 8 and to augment cellular levels of the truncated pro-apoptotic form of the BCL-2 family member BID.

Children were investigated who were receiving glucocorticoid treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). They were randomized to receive either prednisolone or dexamethasone as part of induction of remission. This randomization process provided a suitable opportunity to compare the effects of these two administered steroid on surrogate markers of adipocyte activity (leptin) and hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance (SHBG). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Prospective study over 16 weeks of children randomized to receive prednisolone (40 mg/m2) or dexamethasone (6.5 mg/m2) as part of the MRC-ALL97/99 induction chemotherapy for ALL. Nineteen children (8 male, 11 female) with a median age 5.9 years (range 2.6-13 years) were recruited into the study. Main outcome measures were body mass index (BMI), serum leptin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). RESULTS: Glucocorticoid administration for 5 weeks resulted in significant (P < 0.05) increases in BMI, leptin (corrected for BMI) and the leptin : SHBG ratio and lowering of SHBG. Dose for dose, dexamethasone was significantly more potent than prednisolone in altering these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term glucocorticoid treatment has significant effects on BMI, leptin and SHBG. The leptin : SHBG ratio increase indicates that this may be a novel and sensitive biochemical marker of metabolic change. Our results suggest that glucocorticoid treatment regimens should be kept as short as possible to avoid possible detrimental effects associated with increased adiposity and insulin resistance.","['Wallace, A M', 'Tucker, P', 'Williams, D M', 'Hughes, I A', 'Ahmed, S F']","['Wallace AM', 'Tucker P', 'Williams DM', 'Hughes IA', 'Ahmed SF']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Infirmary,Glasgow, UK. awallace@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin/*analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/08/26 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['1790 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2265.2003.01790.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2003 Jun;58(6):770-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.2003.01790.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using light microscopy and computerised image analysis, the number and size of individual immunostained vessel profiles within a preselected area size range corresponding to capillaries, postcapillary venules, small collecting venules and small arterioles were determined. A significantly larger number of vessels were registered following staining with anti-CD34 than with anti-CD31 or anti-Factor VIII. Moreover, among the smallest capillary-sized vessel profiles in all lesion types, there was a selective relative loss of stainability of anti-CD31 and anti-Factor VIII, resulting in a substantial total loss of visualised capillary-sized vessels compared with anti-CD34. In fact, the number of non-detected capillaries following staining with anti-CD31 and anti-Factor VIII was significantly tumour type specific.

In both p16 -/- and +/+ cells, expression of Tax has been correlated with an increase in CDK4 activity, which subsequently increases the phosphorylation of Rb and drives the infected cells into cell cycle progression. In relation to these effects, Tax has been shown to interact with two components of the INK4-CDK4/6-Rb pathway, p16 and cyclin D(s). While Tax competes with CDK4 for p16 binding, thus suppressing p16 inhibition of CDK4, Tax also binds to cyclin D(s) with concomitant increases in both CDK4 activity and the phosphorylation of cyclin D(s). Here we show that both Tax and residues 1-40 of the N-terminus of Tax, Tax40N, bind to and activate CDK4 in vitro. In the presence of INK4 proteins, binding of Tax and Tax40N to CDK4 counteracts against the inhibition of p16 and p18 and acts as the major path to regulate Tax-mediated activation of CDK4. We also report that Tax40N retains the transactivation ability. These results of in vitro studies demonstrate a potentially novel, p16-independent route to regulate CDK4 activity by the Tax oncoprotein in HTLV-1 infected cells.","['Li, Junan', 'Li, Hongyuan', 'Tsai, Ming-Daw']","['Li J', 'Li H', 'Tsai MD']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Viral', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Tagged Sites', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi034369n [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2003 Jun 10;42(22):6921-8. doi: 10.1021/bi034369n.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few achieve remission; most succumb to relapse and infection. METHODS: A 4-year-old male renal transplant recipient on triple immunosuppression had culture-negative high spiking fever, persistent leukopenia, anemia and severe gastritis. Upper endoscopy showed 2 ulcerating masses in the lower esophagus. RESULTS: Esophageal biopsy showed a highly atypical myelo-monocytic infiltrate. A blastic population of cells featuring convoluted nuclear envelopes with an open chromatin pattern and abundant cytoplasm were filling the submucosa and infiltrating into the muscularis propria. Extensive investigation including bone marrow aspiration showed no spread. Drastic reduction of immunosuppression except 4-mg/d (0.22 mg/kg/d) prednisone for 2 to 3 weeks led to resolution of the leukemic process proven on repeat biopsy. The patient still is in remission 2 years later. CONCLUSION: This case provides evidence that early diagnosis and aggressive reduction of immunosuppression may remit a posttransplant locally invasive acute myelo-monocytic infiltrative process.","['Dixit, Mehul P', 'Farias, Katherine B', 'McQuade, Marjorie', 'Scott, Katherine M']","['Dixit MP', 'Farias KB', 'McQuade M', 'Scott KM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Nephrology, Steele Memorial Children's Research Center, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. mdixit@peds.arizona.edu""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Esophagoscopy', 'Esophagus/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/01/09 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0272638603002129 [pii]', '10.1016/s0272-6386(03)00212-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2003 May;41(5):E16. doi: 10.1016/s0272-6386(03)00212-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed no significant differences comparing the amount of psychosocial care within the various kinds of hematological-oncological diseases. But, as expected, a significant and statistically proven increase of the frequency and duration of psychosocial treatment was found according to the stage of the disease and the psychosocial strain. The frequency of treatment is increasing up to 70 % comparing groups with standard strain to groups with extreme strain. Summarizing the amount of psychosocial care within the different phases of disease, a calculation of costs will be possible for each patient.","['Schreiber-Gollwitzer, B M', 'Schroder, H M', 'Griessmeier, B', 'Labouvie, H', 'Lilienthal, S']","['Schreiber-Gollwitzer BM', 'Schroder HM', 'Griessmeier B', 'Labouvie H', 'Lilienthal S']","['Klinik fur Kinderheilkunde und Jugendmedizin, Universitat Tubingen.']",['ger'],"['Comment', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cost of Illness', 'Crisis Intervention', 'Family Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Palliative Care/psychology', 'Patient Care Team', '*Psychotherapy', '*Sick Role', '*Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological/complications']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2003-39377 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2003 May-Jun;215(3):171-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2003-39377.,,,,Quantitative und qualitative Erfassung patientenbezogener psychosozialer Tatigkeiten in der padiatrischen Onkologie und Hamatologie--Eine multizentrische Untersuchung im Auftrag der PSAPOH.,['PSAPOH'],,,,,,['Klin Padiatr. 2003 May-Jun;215(3):177-8.

In order to improve supportive care and to decrease mortality, we analysed the causes of death and their relationship to the cycles of chemotherapy in children undergoing treatment for AML according to the study AML-BFM 93. RESULTS: Thirty-five (7.4%) of a total of 471 patients treated according to protocol AML-BFM 93 died before or within the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (early death). Fourty-nine patients (10%) did not achieve remission, and 18 (4 %) died of therapy-related complications after having achieved remission. In comparison to earlier AML-BFM studies, early mortality was reduced from 13%, 12%, 9% (AML-BFM 78, 83, 87) to 7% (AML-BFM 93, p-trend = 0.03). In contrast, mortality of patients in complete continuous remission (CCR) did not change. Infectious complications, in particular due to bacterial and fungal pathogens, were the main cause of death. One patient died of arrhythmia associated with SIAD. After stem-cell transplantation in first remission, 7 of 51 patients died, mainly because of graft-versus-host-disease and/or infections. The incidence of infectious complications decreased with the number of chemotherapy cycles and was highest during induction therapy. Fatal complications occurred in one patient during maintenance therapy and in one patient thereafter; both patients were in CCR. Another 14 patients died during intensive therapy (before day 150) mostly with a low percentage of blasts, but no haematologic recovery. The cause of death in these children was mainly bacterial infection or invasive aspergillosis, but seldom progression of leukaemia. CONCLUSION: This analysis confirmed the high incidence of fatal infections in children with AML during chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia. To increase overall survival in children undergoing therapy for AML, we propose (1) to improve the prophylactic and therapeutic measures for haemorrhage and infections, (2) to continue risk-adapted therapy and (3) to treat high-risk patients in specialised centres only.","['Creutzig, U', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Lehrnbecher, T']","['Creutzig U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Lehrnbecher T']","['Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitats-Kinderklinik Munster.

Benzoin is used as a photopolymerization catalyst, chemical intermediate, and flavor ingredient. Groups of 50 male rats were fed diets containing 125 or 250 ppm benzoin for 104 weeks, and similar groups of female rats received feed containing 250 or 500 ppm. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were fed diets containing 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, benzoin for 104 weeks. Groups of 50 untreated rats and mice of each sex were used as matched controls. Rats and mice of either sex probably could have tolerated higher doses. An increased incidence of lymphomas or leukemia occurred in dosed male rats, but the observed dose-related trend was not statistically significant. Mean body weights and clinical signs of low-dose, high-dose, and control male and female rats and male mice were comparable throughout the study. After week 44, mean body weights of dosed female mice were slightly lower (10% or less) than those of the controls. The incidences of lymphomas that occurred in male mice varied with each dose but were not statistically significant when compared with those of matched controls. Lymphomas or leukemias occurred in low-dose female mice at an incidence that was significant when compared with the matched controls. However, because the incidence of lymphomas or leukemias in the high-dose female mice was not significant, the occurrence of these tumors was not clearly related to administration of the test compounds. Under the conditions of this bioassay, benzoin was not carcinogenic for F344 rats or B6C3F1 mice.

Acid Orange 10 (a monoazo textile dye) were conducted by feeding to groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats diets containing 1,000 or 3,000 ppm C.I. Acid Orange 10 for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were fed diets containing 3,000 or 6,000 ppm for 103 weeks. Groups of 90 male and 90 female untreated rats and 50 male and 50 female untreated mice served as controls. Mean body weights and clinical signs of control and dosed rats and mice were comparable. Because no toxic effects or consistent weight differences were observed, the rats and mice may have been able to tolerate higher doses. In male rats with neoplastic nodules of the liver, the dose response trend was positive (P<0.05) and the incidence in the 3,000 ppm group was increased (P<0.05) compared to controls (control, 5/90, 6%; low dose, 3/50, 6%; high dose, 8/50, 16%). One male rat in the high dose group had both a neoplastic nodule and a carcinoma of the liver. This marginal increase in liver cell neoplasms may have been associated with the dietary administration of C.I. Acid Orange 10. For both dose groups of male and female rats, leukemia was significantly (P<0.05) decreased in a dose related (P<0.005) trend (male: 22/90, 24%; 4/50, 8%; 3/50, 6%; female: 16/88, 18%; 2/50, 4%; 0/50). No compound-related nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions were observed in the female rats or in mice of either sex. For 103 weeks C.I.

Mean body weights of dosed female rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of the control animals throughout most of the study. After week 14, an increasing number of dosed male rats died as a result of an unexplained internal hemorrhaging, and all surviving male rats were killed at week 29 to 30. Because of compound-related mortality, butyl benzyl phthalate was not adequately tested for carcinogenicity in male F344/N rats. Mononuclear cell leukemias occurred at a statistically significant (P=0.011) increased incidence in the high-dose group of female rats when compared with the control group and with a significantly (P=0.006) increasing trend (controls 7/49, 14%; low-dose 7/49, 14%; high-dose 18/50, 36%). The incidence in the high-dose group and the overall trend remained statistically significant (P=0.008 and P=0.019) when compared with the historical incidence for F344/N female rats with leukemia at this laboratory (77/ 399, 19%). Further, this leukoproliferation was generally characterized by splenomegaly and often by hepatomegaly. Administration of butyl benzyl phthalate was not associated with increased incidences of any type of tumor among male or female mice. Tumor rates were decreased in female rats for fibroadenomas of the mammary glands (20/49, 14/49, 9/50) and in male mice for lymphomas of the hematopoietic system (13/50, 11/49, 4/50) and for alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (17/50, 11/49, 8/50). Under the conditions of this bioassay, butyl benzyl phthalate was probably carcinogenic for female F344/N rats, causing an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemias. The male F344/N rat study was considered inadequate for evaluation due to compound-related toxicity and early mortality. Butyl benzyl phthalate was not carcinogenic for B6C3F1 mice of either sex.

Disperse Yellow 3 (87.6% dye), a textile dye, was conducted by feeding diets containing 5,000 or 10,000 ppm of the test substance to groups of 50 F344 rats of either sex for 103 weeks. Similar groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 2,500 or 5,000 ppm of the test substance for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 untreated rats and mice of each sex served as controls. Throughout the bioassay, mean body weights of dosed rats and mice of either sex were lower than those of the controls. Survival of dosed rats of either sex was significantly greater than that of the corresponding controls. No other compound-related clinical signs or effects on survival were observed. A significant increase in neoplastic nodules of the liver occurred in dosed male rats as compared to controls (controls 1/49, 2%; low-dose 15/50, 30%; P<0.001; high-dose, 10/50, 20%; P<0.01). No increase was observed for female rats. Stomach tumors, rare in F344 rats (10/2960, 0.3%), were found in the dosed male rats: one adenocarcinoma and a sarcoma in a high-dose male and in the low-dose group a squamous cell papilloma, fibrosarcoma, adenoma, and mucinous adenocarcinoma. The incidence of these tumors was not significantly greater than that in controls; thus, the association between the administration of C.I. Disperse Yellow 3 and the stomach tumors in male rats is not clearly established. Negative trends in the incidences of certain primary tumors in dosed rats included: decreased lymphocytic leukemia in both sexes; decreased malignant mesothelioma and C-cell carcinoma of the thyroid in males; and decreased pituitary chromophobe adenoma and endometrial stromal polyps in females. Hepatocellular adenomas occurred in dosed female mice at incidences significantly higher than that in the controls (control 0/50, 0%; low-dose 6/50, 12%, P<0.05; high-dose 12/50, 24%, P<0.001). The incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas were also higher in the dosed female mice than in the controls, but the increased incidences were not statistically significant (2/50, 4/50, 5/50). A significantly (P<0.05) lower incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was detected among low-dose (7/50, 1/49, 7/49) male mice. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas occurred in high-dose male mice at an incidence significantly (P%lt;0.05) higher than that in the controls (control 2/50, 4%; low-dose 6/49, 12%; high-dose 9/49, 18%). However, the high-dose effect was not significant when adenomas and carcinomas were combined; the incidence among low-dose female mice was significantly reduced as compared with controls. Thus, the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas among males is not considered to be related to treatment with C.I. Disperse Yellow 3. Malignant lymphomas occurred in a dose-related (P<0.05) trend in female mice and at incidences greater (P<0.05) in the high-dose group than that in the controls (10/50; 16/50; 19/50). However, because of the range of variability in the historical incidence of this tumor and because of the lack of a similar effect in male mice or in male and female rats, this increase was not regarded as being unequivocally related to the administration of C.I. Disperse Yellow 3. Under the conditions of this bioassay, C.I. Disperse Yellow 3 was considered to be carcinogenic for male F344 rats, causing an increased incidence of neoplastic nodules of the liver; this dye was not carcinogenic for female F344 rats. In addition, the stomach tumors found in the male rats may have been induced by the administration of the test chemical. C.I. Disperse Yellow 3 was carcinogenic for female B6C3F1 mice, as evidenced by the increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas; C.I. Disperse Yellow 3 was not carcinogenic for male B6C3F1 mice. Also, the increased incidence of malignant lymphoma in female mice may have been associated with the administration of C.I. Disperse Yellow 3.

Similar groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 1,000 or 2,000 ppm of the test substance for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 untreated rats and mice of either sex served as controls. In a 13-week subchronic study, the spleens of most dosed rats were enlarged and pigment (unidentified) was present in the renal tubular epithelium. Lymphoreticular hyperplasia of thymic lymph nodes was found in 75-100% of females receiving 6,000-50,000 ppm D & C Red No. 9 and in 70-100% of male rats receiving 3,000-25,000 ppm. Hemosiderosis of the liver was observed at the high-dose levels in male and female rats. Mice receiving 1,250 ppm or more D & C Red No. 9 had congestion of the spleen and hemosiderin deposits. Thus, the selection of doses for the chronic study was based on the appearance of hemosiderosis and the incidences and severity of splenic lesions observed in the 91-day subchronic study. In the chronic study, mean body weights of dosed rats of either sex and of male mice were comparable with those of controls. After week 50, the mean body weight of high-dose female mice was lower than that of the controls. No compound-related effects on survival or clinical signs were observed for rats or mice of either sex. With the possible exception of female mice, all other dosed groups of rats or mice might have tolerated higher doses, thus a clear maximum tolerated dose may not have been utilized in this study. Splenic sarcomas (0/50, 0/50, 26/48; P<0.001) and neoplastic nodules of the liver (0/50, 6/50, 7/49; P<0.01) were observed in high-dose male rats at incidences significantly higher than those in the controls. Incidences of neoplastic nodules in the livers (1/50, 1/50, 5/50) of female rats showed a statistically significant (P<0.05) trend. Nonneoplastic splenic lesions were also observed in dosed male and female rats. Lymphocytic leukemia was observed in dosed male (10/50, 2/50, 2/50) and female (10/50, 2/50, 1/50) rats at statistically significant (P<0.05) decreased incidences, compared with controls. Adenomas or carcinomas of the preputial gland in male rats (7/50, 2/50, 0/50) occurred with a statistically significant (P<0.01) negative relationship to dose of D & C Red No. 9 (P=0.007). Under the conditions of this bioassay, D & C Red No. 9 was carcinogenic for male F344 rats causing an increased incidence of sarcomas of the spleen and a dose-related increase in neoplastic nodules of the liver. D & C Red No. 9 was not considered to be carcinogenic to female F344 rats, although the increased incidence of neoplastic nodules of the liver may have been associated with administration of the test chemical.

In subchronic studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of either sex were administered vinylidene chloride in corn oil by gavage five times per week at 0, 5, 15, 50, 100, or 250 mg/kg body weight for 13 weeks. At the end of this study, representative tissues from these animals were subjected to histopathological examination. The liver was identified as a target organ for vinylidene chloride toxicity. In the 104-week chronic exposure study, conducted primarily to determine possible carcinogenic potential of vinylidene chloride by the oral route, 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1/N mice of either sex were gavaged with vinylidene chloride suspended in corn oil at dose levels of 1 or 5 mg/kg (rats) and 2 or 10 mg/kg (mice). Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of either sex received corn oil alone and served as vehicle controls. Throughout most of the study, mean body weights of the dosed rats of either sex and high-dose female mice were slightly lower than those of the controls. The absence of compound-related effects on survival or clinical signs suggests that the rats and mice of either sex could have tolerated higher doses. While no significant differences in survival were observed for any group of rats, 12 control and 10 low-dose males were killed accidentally during week 82; this may have compromised the sensitivity of the male rats study. The results of histopathological examination indicated an increased incidence of necrosis of the liver in high-dose male and low-dose female mice and chronic renal inflammation in high-dose rats of either sex. The only observed significant (P>0.05) increase in tumor incidence occurred in low-dose female mice: lymphoma (2/48, 9/49, 6/50) and lymphoma or leukemia (7/48, 15/49, 7/50). These increases were not considered to be related to vinylidene chloride administration because similar effects were not found in the high-dose female mice or in male mice or rats. Under the conditions of this bioassay, vinylidene chloride administered by gavage was not carcinogenic for F344/N rats or B6C3F1/N mice of either sex.

Acid Red 15. It is present as a contaminant in 4-biphenylamine (a rubber antioxidant) and in diphenylamine (a dye intermediate, stabilizer for nitrocellulose explosives, and a topical agent for prevention of screwworm infestation in animals). Single-dose, 14-day, and 13-week studies were conducted using technical-grade 2-biphenylamine (2-aminobiphenyl) containing up to 2.5% of the carcinogenic contaminant, 4-biphenylamine. When the contamination was recognized, analytical development was begun to purify the material. The salt, 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride, was prepared to obtain a more pure test product, which contained 0.006%-0.049% 4-biphenylamine. The prechronic tests were completed by the time purification was accomplished, so data from a second 14-day study with 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride were used to help set dose levels for the chronic study. The results of the comparative 14-day studies showed that technical-grade 2-biphenylamine was more toxic to mice than rats than 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride as evidenced by greater incidence of splenomegaly and greater weight gain depression. The technical-grade 2-biphenylamine caused a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin concentration and a dose-related increase in leukocyte count in male and female mice in the 13-week study. Hemosiderosis, congestion, and extramedullary hematopoiesis were present in the spleens of nearly all rats receiving 3,000 ppm or more of the chemical, and in nearly all mice with 1,000 ppm or more 2-biphenylamine in their diets. The chronic study was conducted with the purified 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride by feeding diets containing 1,000 or 3,000 ppm 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride to groups of 49 or 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex served as controls. Survival of dosed male and female rats and dosed female mice was comparable with that of the corresponding controls. Survival of high-dose male mice was significantly (P<0.010) less than that of low-dose and control male mice. There were little or no differences in body weight changes for rats or mice between dosed and control groups, although there was a slight decrease in body weight gain at the end of the study for high-dose male (-11%) and female (-8%) rats. Inflammatory cells and interstitial fibrosis were found in increased incidence in the kidneys of dosed male rats as compared with controls and were considered to be compound related. In addition to the increase in renal inflammation and fibrosis, dosed male rats had more focal cellular changes of the liver than did the controls. There were no increased or decreased incidences of tumors in rats that could be associated with chemical administration. Myelomonocytic leukemia in male rats (control, 14/50; low-dose, 1/50; high-dose, 4/50) and fibroadenomas of the mammary gland in female rats (22/50, 10/49, 9/50) occurred with significantly (P<0.03) decreasing trends and the incidences in the dosed groups were significantly (P<0.02) lower than that in the controls. There were no increased or decreased incidences of tumors in rats that could be associated with chemical administration. Hemangiosarcomas from all sites occurred in female mice with a statistically significant (P</=0.002) positive trend. The observed incidence of hemangiosarcomas was 0/49, 1/50, and 7/50 in the control, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. The incidence in the high-dose group was significantly (P<0.01) higher than that in controls. The conclusion that this was due to 2-biphenylamine rather than the contaminant, 4-biphenylamine, is supported by the absence of urinary bladder tumors, which are common to 4-biphenylamine. Hemangiosarcomas also occurred in male mice with a statistically significant positive trend (P=0.040 by a life table test), with incidences of 0/50, 2/50, and 3/50. None of the pairwise comparisons were statistically different. The development of hemangiosarcomas may have been curtailedment of hemangiosarcomas may have been curtailed in the high-dose group of male mice, since only 21/50 survived until the termination of the study. The hemangiosarcomas found in female mice are uncommon with only 6/816 (0.7&percnt;) previously seen in controls at the same laboratory. The rate for control male mice is equally low: 7/803 (0.9&percnt;). Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas of the lung occurred at a significantly (P&lt;0.01) decreased rate in male mice with an incidence in dose groups lower (P&lt;0.05) than that in controls. Under the conditions of the bioassay, 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride was not carcinogenic for F344/N rats of either sex. 2-Biphenylamine hydrochloride was carcinogenic for B6C3F1 female mice, inducing hemangiosarcomas at various sites. The evidence for an association between the administration of 2-biphenylamine hydrochloride and the increased incidence of hemangiosarcomas in male mice was equivocal.

Approximately 90% of the phenol produced is used in the manufacture of phenolic (phenol formaldehyde) resins, caprolactam, bisphenol A, alkyl phenol, and adipic acid. The remainder of the phenol is used to produce an assortment of end products, including salicylic acid, phenacetin, dyes, metal cleaners, disinfectants, antiseptics, photographic chemicals, wood preservatives (pentachlorophenol), paints, paint and varnish removers, and agricultural chemicals (2,4-D and parathion). A bioassay of phenol to test for possible carcinogenicity was conducted by providing this substance in drinking water to F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex were given drinking water containing 2,500 or 5,000 ppm phenol for 103 weeks. As matched controls, groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex received tap water. A dose-related depression in mean body weight gain occurred in rats and mice of each sex. Rats and mice given water containing phenol drank less than did the corresponding controls. A dose-related decrease in water consumption was observed for mice. An increased incidence of leukemia or lymphomas was detected in male rats and may have been associated with the administration of phenol. Although the incidence of these tumors in the low-dose group was significantly higher than that in controls, the incidence in the high-dose group was not. Thus an association with administration of phenol was not established. Under the conditions of this bioassay, phenol was not carcinogenic for either male or female F344 rats or male and female B6C3F1 mice.

We retrospectively analyzed the course of seven patients with Crohn's disease and four patients with idiopathic ulcerative colitis who underwent allogeneic SCT between July 1994 and August 2002 for acute and chronic myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. After a median follow-up of 34 months posttransplantation, 10 patients are alive. None of the patients showed IBD activity after SCT, except one patient with mild persistent symptoms of Crohn's disease early after transplant. Colonoscopy after complete discontinuation of prophylactic posttransplant immunosuppression revealed no pathologic findings. These observations imply that host immune dysregulation plays a central role in the perpetuation of IBD. It may be influenced by the implementation of a new allogeneic immune system resulting from the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells.","['Ditschkowski, Markus', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Trenschel, Rudolf', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Elmaagacli, Ahmet H']","['Ditschkowski M', 'Einsele H', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Bunjes D', 'Trenschel R', 'Beelen DW', 'Elmaagacli AH']","['Klinik fur Knochenmarktransplantation, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/complications/physiopathology', 'Crohn Disease/complications/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*complications/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*surgery', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.TP.0000062540.29757.E9 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 May 27;75(10):1745-7. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000062540.29757.E9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As early as at 4 h after intake, resveratrol exhibited antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity. At the same time, some apoptotic-like phenomena were detected such as cell membrane perturbation (phosphatidylserine-annexin V binding), apolipoprotein (APO)-1/FAS (CD95) expression and mitochondrial (delta psi) depolarization. The anticancer drug camptothecin, used as a positive control, did not significantly increase APO-1/FAS (CD95) levels, while only a modest increase in APO-1/FAS-CD95 ligand (CD95-L) was detected. At 12 h, however, resveratrol at concentrations of 100 nM and 1 microM did not exhibit the same antiproliferative activity and increased cell proliferation was correlated to a significant increase in FAS-L expression. We conclude that treatment with low doses of resveratrol, such as those found after moderate wine intake, is not sufficient to stop human leukemia cell line proliferation and that cell resistance, marked by high FAS-L (CD95-L) expression, could be mediated by low (delta psi) mitochondria-released antiapoptotic factors such as BCL-2. It is also suggested that the synergistic action of other wine components with resveratrol might, at least partially, explain its chemopreventive activity.","['Corsi, M M', 'Ponti, W', 'Ferrara, F', 'Venditti, A', 'Malavazos, A', 'Ruscica, M', 'Mihali, D', 'Diana, G M', 'Paraboni, L', 'Bertelli, A A E']","['Corsi MM', 'Ponti W', 'Ferrara F', 'Venditti A', 'Malavazos A', 'Ruscica M', 'Mihali D', 'Diana GM', 'Paraboni L', 'Bertelli AA']","['Clinical Pathology Laboratory, Institute of General Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. mmcorsi@unimi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2003/06/05 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 2002;28(6):235-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence suggests that the resulting MLL fusion genes contribute to leukemogenesis. AF9 is a common MLL fusion partner in acute myeloid leukemia. The AF9 protein functions as a transcriptional activator in artificial reporter gene assays and a structurally related protein in yeast, ANC1/TFG3, is a component of the SWI/SNF complex. Apart from these observations, little is known about the biologic function of AF9 in mammals. We have found that a recently described transcriptional repressor, BCL-6 corepressor (BCoR), interacts with the carboxy-terminus of AF9. The interaction of AF9 with BCoR has been confirmed by independent in vitro and in vivo protein-binding studies. The BCoR gene is expressed as several alternatively spliced transcripts. AF9 only binds BCoR isoforms that contain a unique 34 aa sequence located in the mid-portion of the protein. In artificial reporter gene assays, a BCoR isoform that binds AF9 efficiently suppresses AF9 transcriptional activity, while a nonbinding isoform does not. These results indicate that different isoforms of BCoR have unique biologic properties and that cell function may be partly determined by the different isoforms that are present within the cell.","['Srinivasan, R Sathish', 'de Erkenez, Andrea C', 'Hemenway, Charles S']","['Srinivasan RS', 'de Erkenez AC', 'Hemenway CS']","['1Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCOR protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2003/05/31 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/31 05:00'],"['2003/05/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206361 [doi]', '1206361 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 May 29;22(22):3395-406. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206361.,,,['CA78318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML were randomly assigned to imatinib or interferon alfa plus subcutaneous low-dose cytarabine (IFN+LDAC). Cross-over to the other treatment was permitted because of intolerance or lack of efficacy. Patients completed cancer-specific QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Biologic Response Modifiers) and utility (Euro QoL-5D) questionnaires at baseline and during treatment (n = 1,049). The primary QOL end point was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI; a measure of physical function and well-being). Secondary end points included social and family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and the utility score. Primary analyses were intention to treat with secondary analyses accounting for cross-over. RESULTS: Patients receiving IFN+LDAC experienced a large decline in the TOI, whereas those receiving imatinib maintained their baseline level. Treatment differences at each visit were significant (P <.001) and clinically relevant in favor of imatinib. Mean SFWB, EWB, and utility scores were also significantly better for those patients taking imatinib. Patients who crossed over to imatinib experienced a large increase in TOI; significant (P <.001) differences were observed between patients who did and did not cross over in favor of imatinib. CONCLUSION: Imatinib offers clear QOL advantages compared with IFN+LDAC as first-line treatment of chronic phase CML. In addition, patients who cross over to imatinib from IFN+LDAC experience a significant improvement in QOL compared with patients who continue to take IFN+LDAC.","['Hahn, Elizabeth A', 'Glendenning, G Alastair', 'Sorensen, Mark V', 'Hudgens, Stacie A', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Larson, Richard A', ""O'Brien, Stephen G"", 'Dobrez, Deborah G', 'Hensley, Martee L', 'Cella, David']","['Hahn EA', 'Glendenning GA', 'Sorensen MV', 'Hudgens SA', 'Druker BJ', 'Guilhot F', 'Larson RA', ""O'Brien SG"", 'Dobrez DG', 'Hensley ML', 'Cella D']","['Center on Outcomes, Research and Education, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, 1001 University Pl, Ste 100, Evanston, IL 60201, USA. e-hahn@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life']",,2003/05/31 05:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/05/31 05:00'],"['2003/05/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.12.154 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.12.154 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jun 1;21(11):2138-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.12.154.,,,,,['IRIS Investigators'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary disorder and its treatment, interval from primary disorder to tAPL, characteristics of tAPL, and its outcome were analyzed in 106 patients. RESULTS: Eighty of the 106 cases of tAPL were diagnosed during the last 10 years, indicating an increasing incidence of tAPL. Primary disorders were predominantly breast carcinoma (60 patients), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (15 patients), and other solid tumors (25 patients). Thirty patients had received CT alone, 27 patients had received RT alone, and 49 patients had received both. CT included at least one alkylating agent in 68 patients and at least one topoisomerase II inhibitor in 61 patients, including anthracyclines (30 patients), mitoxantrone (28 patients), and epipodophyllotoxins (19 patients). Median interval from primary disorder to tAPL diagnosis was 25 months (range, 4 to 276 months). Characteristics of tAPL were generally similar to those of de novo APL. With treatment using anthracycline-cytarabine-based CT or all-trans-retinoic acid combined with CT, actuarial survival was 59% at 8 years. CONCLUSION: tAPL is not exceptional, and develops usually less than 3 years after a primary neoplasm (especially breast carcinoma) treated in particular with topoisomerase II-targeted drugs (anthracyclines or mitoxantrone and less often etoposide). Characteristics and outcome of tAPL seem similar to those of de novo APL.","['Beaumont, M', 'Sanz, M', 'Carli, P M', 'Maloisel, F', 'Thomas, X', 'Detourmignies, L', 'Guerci, A', 'Gratecos, N', 'Rayon, C', 'San Miguel, J', 'Odriozola, J', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Huguet, F', 'Vekhof, A', 'Stamatoulas, A', 'Dombret, H', 'Capote, F', 'Esteve, J', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Fenaux, P']","['Beaumont M', 'Sanz M', 'Carli PM', 'Maloisel F', 'Thomas X', 'Detourmignies L', 'Guerci A', 'Gratecos N', 'Rayon C', 'San Miguel J', 'Odriozola J', 'Cahn JY', 'Huguet F', 'Vekhof A', 'Stamatoulas A', 'Dombret H', 'Capote F', 'Esteve J', 'Stoppa AM', 'Fenaux P']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Belgium/epidemiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2003/05/31 05:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/05/31 05:00'],"['2003/05/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.09.072 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.09.072 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jun 1;21(11):2123-37. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.09.072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modulation of its expression could affect the migratory capacity of cells trafficking the BM, such as hematopoietic progenitor and leukemic cells. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is present in the BM environment and constitutes a pivotal molecule controlling BM cell proliferation and differentiation. We used the BM stromal cell line MS-5 as a model to investigate whether SDF-1 expression constitutes a target for TGF-beta1 regulation and its functional consequences. We show here that TGF-beta1 down-regulates SDF-1 expression, both at the mRNA level, involving a decrease in transcriptional efficiency, and at the protein level, as detected in lysates and supernatants from MS-5 cells. Reduction of SDF-1 in supernatants from TGF-beta1-treated MS-5 cells correlated with decreased, SDF-1-dependent, chemotactic, and transendothelial migratory responses of the BM model cell lines NCI-H929 and Mo7e compared with their responses to supernatants from untreated MS-5 cells. In addition, supernatants from TGF-beta1-exposed MS-5 cells had substantially lower efficiency in promoting integrin alpha4beta1-mediated adhesion of NCI-H929 and Mo7e cells to soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and CS-1/fibronectin than their untreated counterparts. Moreover, human cord blood CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells displayed SDF-1-dependent reduced responses in chemotaxis, transendothelial migration, and up-regulation of adhesion to sVCAM-1 when supernatants from TGF-beta1-treated MS-5 cells were used compared with supernatants from untreated cells. These data indicate that TGF-beta1-controlled reduction in SDF-1 expression influences BM cell migration and adhesion, which could affect the motility of cells trafficking the bone marrow.","['Wright, Natalia', 'de Lera, Teresa Lain', 'Garcia-Moruja, Carelia', 'Lillo, Rosa', 'Garcia-Sanchez, Felix', 'Caruz, Antonio', 'Teixido, Joaquin']","['Wright N', 'de Lera TL', 'Garcia-Moruja C', 'Lillo R', 'Garcia-Sanchez F', 'Caruz A', 'Teixido J']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Department of Immunology, Velazquez 144, 28006 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Tgfb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/31 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/05/31 05:00'],"['2003/05/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3190 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50484-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):1978-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3190.

Six possible risk factors including type of donor, stage of disease, age, gender, donor-recipient sex combination and the waiting time from diagnosis to transplantation of relapse were considered. The time to relapse was analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression with stratification on prognostic factors that did not satisfy the Proportional Hazard Assumption. RESULTS: An amount of 447 patients relapsed out of all 3142 patients. The relapse rate was 14.2%. Type of donor and stage of disease showed a clear prognostic effect, but failed the proportional hazard assumption. Therefore, the data were stratified on the combination of type of donor and stage of disease. Within these strata an additional significant effect of age could be observed.

However, the clinical efficacy of DLI in the advanced phase of CML or other types of leukemia has not been clearly defined because of its varying degree of success. We describe a 22-year-old male patient with promyelocytic crisis of CML who had a relapse after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, under reduced-intensity conditioning, from his HLA 2-antigen-mismatched mother. Complete hematologic remission was obtained after transplantation. However, a relapse that occurred on day 66 posttransplantion was characterized by an increase in number of leukemic promyelocytes with simultaneous exacerbation of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient received DLI containing 1 x 10(7)/kg CD3+ cells on day 73. Because rapid improvement of DIC paralleled the decrease in leukemic cells and because it was observed soon after DLI and before the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we hypothesized that leukemia-specific cells other than natural killer cells or cytotoxic T-cells unrelated to GVHD played a role in the graft-versus-leukemia effect observed in our patient.

Blastretriever is a newly developed density centrifugation reagent for retrieving blasts. We examined the utility of Blastretriever in clinical practice. When normal bone marrow (BM) cells were separated with this reagent, myeloblasts and B-cell precursors were enriched and detected as clusters on the FCM cytogram. Compared with a conventional reagent for mononuclear cell preparation, the Blastretriever reagent markedly enriched leukemic myeloblasts, leukemic lymphoblasts, and blastoid lymphoma cells from 36 test samples (BM cells and peripheral blood). We then applied the Blastretriever reagent to samples from 11 consecutive patients who had been referred to us because they exhibited low percentages of blasts (1 patient had only 0.2% blasts).

Most transplant centres do not, currently, prospectively match for DPB1, but emerging data show that DPB1 matching does play a role in determining outcome. We studied the impact of HLA-DPB1 matching on outcome in 143 recipients of T-cell depletion transplants, who matched with their respective unrelated donors (allelic level) at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1. Of those matched at DPB1, 47.2% (17/36) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) as compared to 66.3% (55/83) of those who were mismatched. This led to a 19.1% (95% CI 0.1-38.3%) increase in the chance of developing aGvHD in mismatched patients (P=0.049). Relapse of the original disease occurred in 51 recipients; 23 of 37 (62%) matched at both DPB1 alleles, 28 of 82 (34%) were mismatched at one or two DPB1 alleles. Thus, there was a significantly higher relapse rate (P=0.0011) in transplant recipients who matched at both DPB1 alleles. In conclusion, a donor/recipient DPB1 match was associated with a significantly lower incidence of aGvHD and a significantly higher incidence of disease relapse.

When applied to chemosensitive patients, the lower relapse rates and reasonable long-term outcomes make allogeneic transplantation a promising therapy to pursue. Patient populations, such as those with bone marrow involvement or very high-risk disease, can be identified as having suboptimal outcomes after autotransplantation and may benefit from such an approach. While the exact role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains to be determined, broad recommendations can be suggested for the management of patients with intermediate-grade lymphoma.

Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in cell growth regulation, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and genome stability. Our study here shows that PML colocalizes and associates in vivo with the DNA damage response protein TopBP1 in response to ionizing radiation (IR). Both PML and TopBP1 colocalized with the IR-induced bromodeoxyuridine single-stranded DNA foci. PML and TopBP1 also colocalized with Rad50, Brca1, ATM, Rad9, and BLM. IR and interferon (IFN) coinduce the expression levels of both TopBP1 and PML. In PML-deficient NB4 cells, TopBP1 was unable to form IR-induced foci. All-trans-retinoic acid induced reorganization of the PML nuclear body (NB) and reappearance of the IR-induced TopBP1 foci. Inhibition of PML expression by siRNA is associated with a significant decreased in TopBP1 expression. Furthermore, PML-deficient cells express a low level of TopBP1, and its expression cannot be induced by IR or IFN. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PML in PML(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts substantially increased TopBP1 expression, which colocalized with the PML NBs. These studies demonstrated a mechanism of PML-dependent expression of TopBP1. PML overexpression induced TopBP1 protein but not the mRNA expression. Pulse-chase labeling analysis demonstrated that PML overexpression stabilized the TopBP1 protein, suggesting that PML plays a role in regulating the stability of TopBP1 in response to IR. Together, our findings demonstrate that PML regulates TopBP1 functions by association and stabilization of the protein in response to IR-induced DNA damage.","['Xu, Zhi-Xiang', 'Timanova-Atanasova, Anna', 'Zhao, Rui-Xun', 'Chang, Kun-Sang']","['Xu ZX', 'Timanova-Atanasova A', 'Zhao RX', 'Chang KS']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (TOPBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/05/30 05:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/05/30 05:00'],"['2003/05/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.12.4247-4256.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Jun;23(12):4247-56. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.12.4247-4256.2003.,,,"['R01 CA055577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC156140,,,,,,,

Besides their functions in inflammation and the immune response, these cytokines play also a crucial role in haematopoiesis, liver and neuronal regeneration, embryonal development and fertility. Dysregulation of IL-6-type cytokine signalling contributes to the onset and maintenance of several diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis and various types of cancer (e.g. multiple myeloma and prostate cancer). IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via the signal transducers gp (glycoprotein) 130, LIF receptor and OSM receptor leading to the activation of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades. This review focuses on recent progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IL-6-type cytokine signal transduction. Emphasis is put on the termination and modulation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway mediated by tyrosine phosphatases, the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signalling) feedback inhibitors and PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins.

It is shown that period analysis provides much more up-to-date estimates of survival curves than traditional cohort-based survival analysis indeed, at least as long as there is ongoing improvement in survival rates over time, as it seems to be the case for many forms of childhood cancer. The most recent 10-year period survival estimates indicate that survival rates of children with cancer achieved by the end of the 20th century are substantially higher than previously available survival statistics have suggested. Application of period analysis may be particularly useful in the field of childhood cancer as it may help to prevent patients, their families and clinicians from being burdened by outdated, often too pessimistic survival expectations.","['Brenner, H']",['Brenner H'],"['Department of Epidemiology, German Centre for Research on Ageing, Bergheimer Str. 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany. brenner@dzfa.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demography', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600947 [doi]', '6600947 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2003 Jun 2;88(11):1693-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600947.,,,,,,,,,PMC2377141,,,,,,,

Using an RNase protection assay, we looked for gene expression of 10 anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins in 12 IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). A high Mcl-1 gene expression was found in all HMCLs and the other genes were variably expressed. Out of the 10 Bcl-2-family members, only the Mcl-1 gene was regulated by IL-6. Upon starvation of IL-6, Mcl-1 gene expression decreased in association with myeloma cell apoptosis and was upregulated after adding IL-6 again in association with myeloma cell survival. A constitutive Mcl-1 expression was induced with an Mcl-1-GFP retrovirus in two IL-6-dependent HMCLs. The Mcl-1 HMCLs have a marked reduced apoptosis upon IL-6 starvation compared to HMCLs transduced with control GFP retrovirus and may grow without adding IL-6. These data emphasize the major role of Mcl-1 antiapoptotic protein in the IL-6-induced survival of human myeloma cells.","['Jourdan, Michel', 'Veyrune, Jean-Luc', 'De Vos, John', 'Redal, Nicole', 'Couderc, Guilhem', 'Klein, Bernard']","['Jourdan M', 'Veyrune JL', 'De Vos J', 'Redal N', 'Couderc G', 'Klein B']","['INSERM U475 and Unit for Cellular Therapy, CHU Montpellier, 34197 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206423 [doi]', '1206423 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 May 15;22(19):2950-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206423.,,,,,,,,,PMC2396235,,,['HALMS130855'],['NLM: HALMS130855'],,,

To date, no B-lymphocyte-specific cis-regulatory element has been identified in this region. Since ETS proteins are known to regulate transcription of numerous retroviruses, we searched for the presence in the BLV promoter region of binding sites for PU.1/Spi-1, a B-cell- and macrophage-specific ETS family member. In this report, nucleotide sequence analysis of the viral LTR identified a PUbox located at -95/-84 bp. We demonstrated by gel shift and supershift assays that PU.1 and the related Ets transcription factor Spi-B interacted specifically with this PUbox. A 2-bp mutation (GGAA-->CCAA) within this motif abrogated PU.1/Spi-B binding. This mutation caused a marked decrease in LTR-driven basal gene expression in transient transfection assays of B-lymphoid cell lines, but did not impair the responsiveness of the BLV promoter to the virus-encoded transactivator Tax(BLV). Moreover, ectopically expressed PU.1 and Spi-B proteins transactivated the BLV promoter in a PUbox-dependent manner. Taken together, our results provide the first demonstration of regulation of the BLV promoter by two B-cell-specific Ets transcription factors, PU.1 and Spi-B. The PU.1/Spi-B binding site identified here could play an important role in BLV replication and B-lymphoid tropism.","['Dekoninck, Ann', 'Calomme, Claire', 'Nizet, Severine', 'de Launoit, Yvan', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Van Lint, Carine']","['Dekoninck A', 'Calomme C', 'Nizet S', 'de Launoit Y', 'Burny A', 'Ghysdael J', 'Van Lint C']","['Laboratoire de Virologie Moleculaire, Service de Chimie Biologique, Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires (IBMM), Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue des Profs Jeener et Brachet 12, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '148350-00-9 (SPIB protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sheep', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206392 [doi]', '1206392 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 May 15;22(19):2882-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206392.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matrix metalloproteinases were correlated with clinicopathological factors and with survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models. In MM, pro- and active MMP-2 levels were significantly greater than for MMP-9 (P=0.006, P<0.001). Active MMP-2 was significantly greater in MM than in UP (P=0.04). MMP-2 activity was equivalent between IP and MM, but both pro- and active MMP-9 activities were greater in IP (P=0.02, P=0.009).

We analysed tumour spectrum and age at diagnosis of malignancies in 51 families with MM/CFA. In addition, we evaluated observed frequency (OF); expected frequency (EF); and relative risk (RR) of occurrence of malignancies in these families. In all cases peripheral blood examination of common Polish founder BRCA1 mutations was performed. In 25 families, we analysed loss of heterozygosity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. We identified two subgroups of cases: 22 MM/CFA families with MM diagnosed before 55 years (< or =55 MM/CFA) and 29 MM/CFA families with MM diagnosed after 55 (>55 MM/CFA). In these families we observed increased proportion of breast cancers: 17.52% in the first subgroup (mean age of diagnosis 48.5) and 12.15% in the second subgroup. The odds ratio for breast tumours occurring before 50 in < or =55 MM/CFA families was 3.71. We also observed increased numbers of liver cancers, CSU and leukaemias. OF and EF analyses revealed increased risk of occurrence of cancers of breast (OF 10.4%, EF 4.5%) and liver (OF 1.9%, EF 0.8%) in women from MM/CFA families, RR for breast tumours was approximately 3.3 in < or =55 MM/CFA families. Molecular examination of MM/CFA families revealed no alterations within the BRCA2 gene and one germline mutation of the BRCA1 gene.

The gene encoding the histone acetyltransferase MOZ is also rearranged in some acute leukaemias, resulting in the expression of MOZ fusion proteins. MOZ has recently been shown to interact directly with RUNX1, indicating that MOZ fusion proteins act by deregulating RUNX1 function. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine that also inhibits proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells. Amongst the conserved sequence elements in the human MIP-1alpha promoter are two consensus RUNX sites. We have investigated the role of these RUNX sites in the regulation of the MIP-1alpha promoter by PMA/PHA stimulation in Jurkat T-cells. RUNX1 can specifically bind to both RUNX sites in vitro and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that endogenous RUNX1 is constitutively bound to the endogenous MIP-1alpha promoter. Mutation of the RUNX sites demonstrated that the proximal RUNX site is essential for PMA/PHA-stimulated activation of the MIP-1alpha promoter. Activation of the promoter can also be inhibited by heterologous expression of the repressor protein AML-1/ETO. We further demonstrate that MOZ can activate the MIP-1alpha promoter and that this activation is largely dependent upon the proximal RUNX site. Moreover, we show that co-expression of MOZ and RUNX1 can synergistically activate the MIP-1alpha promoter. The regulation of MIP-1alpha expression by RUNX1/MOZ is discussed in the context of MIP-1alpha's role as an inhibitor of haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and its potential importance in leukaemias associated with RUNX1 or MOZ chromosomal rearrangements.","['Bristow, Claire A P', 'Shore, Paul']","['Bristow CA', 'Shore P']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, 2.205, Stopford Building, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkg401 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Jun 1;31(11):2735-44. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkg401.,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,PMC156734,,,,,,,

Various investigation results suggest that methylation/deacetylation events are modulated by extracellular and cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways closely involved in regulating cell differentiation. To analyse gene silencing mechanisms and assess if potential pharmacological treatment affects gene silencing kinetics we transduced U937 myelomonocytic cells with a bicistronic retroviral construct carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) and beta-galactosidase (Lac-Z) genes. This vector can be employed in vivo and in vitro to render transduced cell populations susceptible to ganciclovir (GCV). We verified the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) alone or combined with 5'-azacytidine (5'aza-C) on transcription downmodulation. Our results indicate that in our in vitro model TSA is able to reactivate transgene expression, more efficiently and with quicker kinetics (12-24h) than 5'aza-C (36-48 h). The effect is dose dependent (between 1 and 50 nM), with no relevant toxicity. Treatment with both drugs is synergistic in gene reactivation in terms of extension and persistence, with low toxicity and no relevant differentiating effects. The cells in which transgene expression has been reactivated undergo progressive silencing, but once weekly drug treatment can maintain high transgene expression levels for more than 90 days with no evidence of selection. The results obtained by treating U937 transduced clones with TSA and/or 5'aza-C together with IL-3, G-CSF or GM-CSF cytokines suggest that transduced U937 differentiation levels do not affect basal expression, but render these cells more responsive to reactivation by TSA or TSA plus 5'aza-C, but not to 5'aza-C alone. In conclusion, the results suggest that in vitro inhibition of histone deacetylase by TSA can interfere with gene silencing mechanisms affecting 5' Moloney murine leukaemia virus long terminal repeat (MoMuLV-LTR) driven transgene expression thus providing the rationale for TSA and/or 5'aza-C administration in animal models for the translation on gene therapy applications.","['Bartoli, Andrea', 'Fettucciari, Katia', 'Fetriconi, Ilaria', 'Rosati, Emanuela', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Tabilio, Antonio', 'Delfino, Domenico Vincenzo', 'Rossi, Ruggero', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco']","['Bartoli A', 'Fettucciari K', 'Fetriconi I', 'Rosati E', 'Di Ianni M', 'Tabilio A', 'Delfino DV', 'Rossi R', 'Marconi P']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, General Pathology and Immunology Section, General Hospital, University of Perugia, Monteluce, 06100 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects/physiology', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/*drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['S1043661803000793 [pii]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2003 Jul;48(1):111-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of plating efficiency, C7-10 cells were approximately two times more resistant to UV light than human 293 leukemia cells. Recovery after UV irradiation was accompanied by an increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS), which was measured by incorporation of (3)H-thymidine into acid-precipitable DNA in the presence of hydroxyurea. Under standardized conditions, UDS was maximal after a 10 min exposure (120 J/m(2)), and declined after longer exposures. In addition, UV treatment is associated with a small but reproducible increase in repair of plasmid DNA in transiently transfected cells.

HDAC inhibitors suppress the activities of multiple HDACs, leading to an increase in histone acetylation. This histone acetylation induces an enhancement of the expression of specific genes that elicit extensive cellular morphologic and metabolic changes, such as growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. DNMT inhibitors, such as 5-aza-cytidine (5-aza-CR) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) are also widely studied because DNA hypomethylation induces the re-activation of tumor suppressor genes that are silenced by methylation-mediated mechanisms. Recently, the combination of HDAC inhibitors or demethylating agents with other chemo-therapeutics has gained increasing interest as a possible molecularly targeted therapeutic strategy. In particular, the combination of HDAC inhibitors with demethylating agents has become attractive since histones are connected to DNA by both physical and functional interactions. To date, the accumulating evidence has confirmed the hypothesis that the combination of HDAC and DNMT inhibition is very effective (and synergistic) in inducing apoptosis, differentiation and/or cell growth arrest in human lung, breast, thoracic, leukemia and colon cancer cell lines. This review will discuss the in vitro effects of HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate, depsipeptide (FR901228, FK228), valproic acid (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and the demethylating agent, 5-aza-CdR used alone and in combination treatment of human cancer cells and the possible mechanisms involved.","['Zhu, Wei-Guo', 'Otterson, Gregory A']","['Zhu WG', 'Otterson GA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Med Chem Anticancer Agents,Current medicinal chemistry.

The main pathways leading from topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage to cell death involve activation of caspases in the cytoplasm by proapoptotic molecules released from mitochondria. In some cells, apoptotic response also involves the death receptor Fas (APO-1/CD95). The engagement of these apoptotic effector pathways is tightly controlled by upstream regulatory pathways that respond to DNA lesions-induced by topoisomerase inhibitors in cells undergoing apoptosis. These include the proapoptotic Chk2, c-Abl and SAPK/JNK pathways, the survival PI(3)kinase-Akt-dependent pathway and the transcription factors p53 and NF-kappaB. Initiation of cellular responses to DNA lesions-induced by topoisomerase inhibitors is ensured by the protein kinases DNA-PK, ATM and ATR, which bind to DNA breaks. These kinases commonly called ""DNA sensors"" mediate their effects (DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis) by phosphorylating a large number of substrates, including several downstream kinases such as c-Abl and the checkpoint protein Chk2. c-Abl induces apoptosis by activating cell death pathways (e.g., SAPK, p53 and p73) and inhibiting cell survival pathways [e.g., PI(3)kinase]. The DNA-damage regulating kinase Chk2, in addition to its role in cell cycle arrest and/or DNA repair, can induce apoptosis by phosphorylation/activation of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and p53. Finally, we will review the recent observations that support a role for topoisomerases in chromatin fragmentation during the execution phase of apoptosis.","['Sordet, Olivier', 'Khan, Qasim A', 'Kohn, Kurt W', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Sordet O', 'Khan QA', 'Kohn KW', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Med Chem Anticancer Agents,Current medicinal chemistry.

These drugs have, of course, been the objects of intense basic research, as well as preclinical and clinical study. Although specific biochemical lesions (DNA damage) have been associated with Ara-C- and DNR-mediated cytotoxicity, the pathways leading to the induction of apoptosis remain ill defined. This standpoint has forced investigators to explore a new concept in cell response to cytotoxic stress: apoptosis signaling. The recent identification of a ceramide (CER) mediated apoptotic signaling pathway triggered by antitumor agents offers a new perspective for the treatment of neoplastic cells. Indeed, these agents have been shown to induce apoptosis through the activation of a sphingomyelinase (SMase) responsible for the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) and the generation of CER. The latter acts as a potent apoptosis mediator, triggering several downstream signaling pathways among which the stress-activated protein kinase cascade (MEKK1-SEK1-SAP/JNK) plays a critical role in apoptosis induction. However, the spacio-temporal organization of the key early signaling events is unclear. The present review delineates what appears to be a critical factor in apoptosis signaling: sphingomyelin enriched plasma membrane rafts. The apparent topological partitioning between DNA damage and apoptosis signaling (integrated into specialized plasma membrane domains) is discussed.","['Bezombes, Christine', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Jaffrezou, Jean-Pierre']","['Bezombes C', 'Laurent G', 'Jaffrezou JP']","['INSERM U563-CPTP, Institut Claudius Regaud, 20 rue du Pont St Pierre 31052, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Med Chem Anticancer Agents,Current medicinal chemistry.

This is the first report describing mutation of the RB2/p130 gene in ATL, suggesting that RB2/p130 may be involved in the development of ATL, and may behave as a tumor suppressor gene in T lymphocytes.","['Takeuchi, Seisho', 'Takeuchi, Naoko', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Fermin, Anthony C', 'De Vas, Sven', 'Seo, Hiromi', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Takeuchi S', 'Takeuchi N', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Fermin AC', 'De Vas S', 'Seo H', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Okohcho, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. takeuti@kochi-ms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000063480 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Apr;44(4):699-701. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000063480.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal hematopoiesis, the most immature stem cells have the CD34 + CD34 - phenotype. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), although blasts from most patients are CD38 +, some are CD38 - . AML blasts are blocked at early stages of differentiation; in some leukemic cells this block can be overcome by a variety of agents, including retinoids, that induce maturation into macrophages and granulocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Retinoids can also induce CD38 expression. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between induction of CD38 expression and induction of myeloid differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) in normal and leukemic human hematopoietic cells. In the promyelocytic (PML) CD34 - cell lines, HL60 and CB-1, as well as in normal CD34 + CD34 - hematopietic progenitor cells RA induced both CD38 expression as well as morphological and functional myeloid differentiation that resulted in loss of self-renewal. In contrast, in the myeloblastic CD34 + leukemic cell lines, ML-1 and KG-1a, as well as in primary cultures of cells derived from CD34 + -AML (M0 and M1) patients, RA caused an increase in CD38 + that was not associated with significant differentiation. Yet, long exposure of ML-1, but not KG-1, cells to RA resulted in loss of self-renewal. The results suggest that while in normal hematopoietic cells and in PML CD34 - cells induction of CD38 antigen expression by RA results in terminal differentiation along the myeloid lineage, in early myeloblastic leukemic CD34 + cells, induction of CD38 and differentiation are not functionally related. Since, several lines of evidence suggest that the CD38 - cells are the targets of leukemic transformation, transition of these cellsinto CD38 + phenotype by RA or other drugs may have therapeutic effect, either alone or in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs, regardless the ability of the cells to undergo differentiation.","['Prus, Eugenia', 'Fibach, Eitan']","['Prus E', 'Fibach E']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital Ein-Kerem, POB 12000, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*biosynthesis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000060564 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Apr;44(4):691-8. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000060564.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of these therapies might be greatly enhanced by targeting cell surface proteins unique to the malignant clone, which for leukemias of the B cell lineage means clonotypic surface immunoglobulin (sIg). As this immunoglobulin (Ig) is necessarily epitope specific, we are developing ligand-toxin conjugates (LTCs) as a strategy for delivering toxins and other drugs to clonotypic tumor cells. Here we report in vitro studies that illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. LTC comprising the DNP hapten conjugated to ricin A toxin (DNP-RTA) were shown to specifically and effectively kill anti-DNP secreting murine hybridoma (U7.6) cells but not other hybridoma cells (1B12), a murine erythroleukemia cell line (Friend's Leukemia or) normal mouse spleen cells. In addition to direct toxicity, LTC treatment negatively affected the growth characteristics of the few surviving cells as reflected in decreased growth index and an increase in growth inhibition over 72 h post treatment. Interestingly, U7.6 cells that survived one or two LD90 dose(s) of LTC showed no alteration in their dose response to a subsequent attack of LTC indicating that this treatment strategy may not induce drug resistance. These data suggest that LTC therapy may be a new and effective strategy for specific destruction of tumor cells such as myeloma plasma cells and could be extended to other tumors where clonotypic receptors can be identified.","['Firer, Michael A', 'Laptev, Raisa', 'Kasatkin, Ilena', 'Trombka, David']","['Firer MA', 'Laptev R', 'Kasatkin I', 'Trombka D']","['Immunology Laboratory, Dept.

Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione, which is active in NHL and its toxicity profile may be more favorable than doxorubicin with respect to alopecia, mucositis and cardiotoxicity. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of an escalated dose of mitoxantrone with that of standard doxorubicin, used in the CHOP regimen in patients with ANHL. One hundred and forty three eligible patients with ANHL were randomized to receive 6 cycles of either CHOP (n = 71) or intensified CNOP (iCNOP) (n = 72), with mitoxantrone 20 mg/m2, i.v., d.1 instead of doxorubicin. Complete responders (CR) were again randomized either to receive interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) maintenance (3 MU t.i.w., s.c.) or not. The CR rate was 70 vs. 76% for iCNOP and CHOP (p = 0.45), and the overall response rate was 81 vs. 83%, respectively (p = 0.71). The 5-year failure free survival (FFS) was 48 and 50% in the iCNOP and CHOP arm, respectively (p = 0.45), and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 61 vs. 64% (p = 0.56). IFN-alpha did not prolong relapse free survival (p = 0.91). iCNOP produced less alopecia (p = 0.001) but more febrile episodes (p = 0.04) than CHOP, while requiring more frequent G-CSF support (p = 0.01). Two cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were recorded, both in the iCNOP arm (p = 0.14). In conclusion, iCNOP was equally effective to CHOP in patients with ANHL, producing more leukopenia and febrile episodes, but less alopecia.

The intermembrane space of mitochondria contains a number of soluble molecules whose release from the organelle to the cytosol or the nucleus induces cell death. Thus, molecules that directly trigger mitochondria membrane permeabilisation are efficient cytotoxic drugs. Mitochondria is one of the cellular targets for commonly used epipodophyllotoxins, adenine deoxynucleoside analogs and taxanes as well as recently developped agents such as the pentacyclic triterpene betulinic acid and the lymphotoxic agent FTY720. Most informations on anthracyclines point to the mitochondrial membrane as the main target of cardiotoxicity. Mitochondria is also a target for arsenite trioxide, an old cytotoxic agent recently used for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, lonidamine, a dichlorinated derivative of indazole-3-carboxylic acid developped as a chemosensitizer, the retinoic acid receptor gamma activator CD437 and nitric oxide (NO). Recently, cytotoxic drugs have been specifically designed to directly affect the mitochondrial function. These include the positively charged alpha-helical peptides, which are attracted to and disrupt the negatively charged mitochondrial membrane, thus inducing mammalian cell apoptosis when targeted intracellularly. Various strategies have been proposed also to directly inhibit Bcl-2 and related anti-apoptotic proteins, including antisense oligonucleotides (e.g. Genasense, currently tested in phase III trials), small molecules that mimic the BH3 dimerization domain of these proteins and kinase inhibitors. Ligands of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor such as the isoquinolone carboxamide derivative PK11195 also overcome the membrane-stabilizing effect of Bcl-2, whereas the adenosine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and the mitochondrial DNA are two other potential cellular targets for cytotoxic agents. Potentially, new compounds directly targeting the mitochondria may be useful in treating hematological malignancies. The challenge is now to selectively target these mitochondria permeabilizing agents to malignant cells. This review briefly summarizes the role of the mitochondria in cell death and describes these various strategies for targeting the mitochondria to induce apoptosis.","['Solary, Eric', 'Bettaieb, Ali', 'Dubrez-Daloz, Laurence', 'Corcos, Laurent']","['Solary E', 'Bettaieb A', 'Dubrez-Daloz L', 'Corcos L']","[""INSERM U517, IFR 100, 7 boulevard Jeanne d'Arc, 21000 Dijon, France. esolary@u-bourgogne.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retinoids)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Retinoids/metabolism']",144,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000038001 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Apr;44(4):563-74. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000038001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphometric evaluation was performed using a standard program set MicroImage (OLYMPUS). The greatest number of typical nucleated MK, ""naked"" nuclei, anucleated cytoplasmic fragments and the largest area were found in PV. The circular deviation factor of MK and their nuclei increased in all cases. The greatest number of clusters was observed in PV and HCL. A significant increase in the number of dysplastic and ""naked"" nuclei of MK was noted in all selected haematological diseases. The presence of neoplastic cells in bone marrow increased the morphological changes in MK. Quantitative and morphometrical significant differentiation of MK in separate microscopic field in the same slides confirms the necessity of performing trephine biopsies in each patient with haematological disorders.","['Lemancewicz, Dorota', 'Dzieciol, Janusz', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Litwiejko-Pietrynczak, Elzbieta', 'Boguslowicz, Wanda']","['Lemancewicz D', 'Dzieciol J', 'Kloczko J', 'Litwiejko-Pietrynczak E', 'Boguslowicz W']","['Department of Human Anatomy, Medical Academy of Bialystok, Poland. anpraw@amb.ac.bialystok.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Morphol (Warsz),Folia morphologica,0374620,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Size', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology']",,2003/05/29 05:00,2003/10/17 05:00,['2003/05/29 05:00'],"['2003/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Morphol (Warsz). 2003 Feb;62(1):51-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Specimens of 23 cases lethal midline granulomas (LMG) were examined: (1) HE stain for immunohistochemical staining for TIA-1, CD43, CD20, CD3 epsilon, CD56 and in situ hybridization for EBV encoded small nuclear RNA(EBER1/2, Y017, DAK0). (2) The cases histories were reviewed. RESULTS: (1) 14 cases were confirmed by histological features. In the 14 cases, tumor cells expressed TIA-1, CD56, CD3 epsilon, CD43, EBER1/2 positive. (2) Among them 8 cases (57%) showed special clinic features of LMG, Nasopharynx, pharynx and laryngeal involvement were found in other 6 cases. One case revealed lymphoid leukemia. In other 2 cases, gastrointestinal tract were involved. Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) complication happened in 1 case. CONCLUSION: The tumor cells of nasal T/NK cell lymphomas expressed TIA-1, CD56, CD43, CD3 epsilon may suggest it originates from NK cell. The high association with EBV may suggest in situ hybridization. 57% patients showed that the special clinic features of the LMG, and gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, peripheral blood were involved in some cases.

Interestingly, JL1 was shown to be expressed in most leukemias, irrespective of their immunophenotype, and subpopulations of normal bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNCs). Here we investigated the potential usefulness of the anti-JL1 mAb as a therapeutic tool for leukemia. We demonstrated that the proliferation of cultured human leukemia cells was dramatically inhibited in vitro by anti-JL1 mAb conjugated with the polypeptide toxin, gelonin, but not by gelonin alone. We then systematically investigated the reactivity of the anti-JL1 mAb against normal human tissues to evaluate possible side effects along with various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumor cell lines. All of 33 types of normal tissues except thymus and subpopulation of BM MNCs were clearly devoid of JL1 expression. Among tumor cell lines, all the nonhematopoietic cell lines tested were negative for JL1 expression, while some hematopoietic cell lines contained JL1 antigen. Collectively, the results showed the cytotoxic effects of anti-JL1-based immunotoxin against JL1-positive leukemic cells, sparing most normal tissues other than thymocytes and some BM MNCs. Therefore, we strongly suggest that gelonin-conjugated anti-JL1 mAb immunotoxin could be developed as a potential immunotherapeutic agent in the treatment of various types of JL1-positive acute leukemias.","['Shin, Young Kee', 'Choi, Yoon La', 'Choi, Eun Young', 'Kim, Min Kyung', 'Kook, Myeong-Cherl', 'Chung, Junho', 'Choi, Yang-Kyu', 'Kim, Heung Sik', 'Song, Hyung Geun', 'Park, Seong Hoe']","['Shin YK', 'Choi YL', 'Choi EY', 'Kim MK', 'Kook MC', 'Chung J', 'Choi YK', 'Kim HS', 'Song HG', 'Park SH']","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 28 Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu, 110-799, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (JL1 antigen)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Immunotoxins', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Plant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/28 05:00,2003/09/26 05:00,['2003/05/28 05:00'],"['2002/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-003-0374-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Aug;52(8):506-12. doi: 10.1007/s00262-003-0374-y.

We reviewed all the reported cases of PEMMT of the breast in the English-language literature since 1965. In addition, we present a new case of PEMMT of the breast who presented with a mass in her right breast mimicking a breast malignancy and was initially misdiagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A careful histologic examination with immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence of PEMMT of the breast. Treatment with systemic chemotherapy and local radiotherapy rendered a complete remission. Seventeen cases of PEMMT of the breast were reported in the English literature from 1965 to 2003. Most of the cases were misdiagnosed initially as lymphomas, breast carcinomas, or malignant melanomas. PEMMT of the breast is a poorly recognized entity whose diagnosis frequently challenges both the pathologist and the oncologist.

An earlier report showed that ectopic overexpression of PML precludes the disaggregation of ND10 but has no effect on viral replication. PML has been reported to mediate the effects of interferon (IFN) and viral mutants lacking ICP0 (Delta alpha 0 mutants). To test the hypothesis that HSV disaggregates ND10 structures and disperses PML to preclude IFN-mediated antiviral effects, we tested the accumulation of viral proteins and virus yields from murine PML(+/+) and PML(-/-) cells mock treated or exposed to IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or both and infected with the wild-type or Delta alpha 0 mutant virus. We report the following results. (i) The levels of growth of wild-type and mutant viruses and of accumulation of viral proteins were not significantly different in untreated PML(+/+) and PML(-/-) cells. (ii) Major effects of IFN-alpha and -gamma were observed in PML(+/+) cells infected with the Delta alpha 0 mutant virus, and more minor effects were observed in cells infected with the wild-type virus. The effects of the IFNs on either wild-type or the mutant virus in PML(-/-) cells were minimal. (iii) The mixture of IFN-alpha and -gamma was more effective than either IFN alone, but again, the effect was more drastic in PML(+/+) cells than in PML(-/-) cells.

This motif is conserved in various lengths in most MLV-like viruses. One exception is that spleen necrosis virus (SNV) does not contain a well-defined domain of charged residues. When 33 amino acids of the MLV motif were deleted to mimic SNV CA, the resulting mutant produced drastically reduced amounts of virions and the virions were noninfectious. Furthermore, these viruses had abnormal sizes, often contained punctate structures resembling those in the cell cytoplasm, and packaged both ribosomal and viral RNA. When 11 or 15 amino acids were deleted to modify the MLV CA to resemble those from other gammaretroviruses, the deletion mutants produced virions at levels comparable to those of the wild-type virus and were able to complete one round of virus replication without detectable defects. We generated 10 more mutants that displayed either the wild-type or mutant phenotype. The distribution of the wild-type or mutant phenotype did not directly correlate with the number of amino acids deleted, suggesting that the function of the motif is determined not simply by its length but also by its structure. Structural modeling of the wild-type and mutant proteins suggested that this region forms alpha-helices; thus, we termed this motif the ""charged assembly helix."" This is the first description of the charged assembly helix motif in MLV CA and demonstration of its role in virus budding and assembly.","['Cheslock, Sara Rasmussen', 'Poon, Dexter T K', 'Fu, William', 'Rhodes, Terence D', 'Henderson, Louis E', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'McGrath, Connor F', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Cheslock SR', 'Poon DT', 'Fu W', 'Rhodes TD', 'Henderson LE', 'Nagashima K', 'McGrath CF', 'Hu WS']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['*Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Capsid/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Virion/physiology', '*Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/05/28 05:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/05/28 05:00'],"['2003/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.12.7058-7066.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jun;77(12):7058-66. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.12.7058-7066.2003.,,,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC156152,,,,,,,

The interaction between HBV Pol and p11 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins synthesized either in vitro or in transfected cells and by inhibition of the DNA polymerase activity of HBV Pol by p11. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected human cell lines revealed that, although most HBV Pol and p11 was restricted to the cytoplasm, a small proportion of each protein colocalized as nuclear speckles; HBV Pol was not detected in the nucleus in the absence of p11. The HBV Pol-p11 nuclear speckles coincided with nuclear bodies containing the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML. Furthermore, the association of HBV Pol-p11 with PML was increased by exposure of cells to EGTA and inhibited by valinomycin.

This work was carried out to elucidate the molecular mechanism of LIGHT-sensitized, interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-mediated apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. It was revealed that LIGHT treatment resulted in down-regulation of anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family member: Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bag-1, and Mcl-1; up-regulation of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family member: Bak and Ser (112)-phosphor-Bad; down-regulation of pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 member Bax; the other pro-apoptosis member Bid remains unaltered. LIGHT treatment also resulted in activation of caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, DFF45, and PARP. However, caspase activation and caspase activity, especially caspase-3 activity, is not required for LIGHT-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells, since caspase-3 inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, and a broad range caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone failed to block the apoptosis induced by LIGHT and IFNgamma in MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, LIGHT-sensitized IFNgamma-mediated apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells is probably through down-regulation of anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family members; it could be caspase (especially caspase-3)-independent, even though extensive caspase activation was observed.","['Zhang, Manchao', 'Guo, Ribo', 'Zhai, Yifan', 'Yang, Dajun']","['Zhang M', 'Guo R', 'Zhai Y', 'Yang D']","['Structure Biology and Cancer Drug Discovery Program, Lombardi Cancer Center and Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA. manchaoz@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNFSF14 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism/physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/05/28 05:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/05/28 05:00'],"['2003/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383503001484 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00148-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2003 Jun 10;195(2):201-10. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00148-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of our study show that the MTT-reducing activity can be increased by the polyphenolic antioxidant resveratrol without a corresponding increase in the number of living cells and that this occurs at a concentration range of the antioxidant which is not sufficient to induce apoptosis but suffices to slow down cell growth. This phenomenon appears to be restricted to proliferation inhibitors with antioxidant properties and is cell type-specific.

Nineteen of the patients were suffering the blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML) and ten patients refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PB and BM mononuclear cells were cultured in methylcellulose alone or with concentrations of TR ranging between 10 and 200 microM. TR produced a dose dependent inhibition of colony forming unit (CFU)-blast growth in all the samples tested from BM and PB. The most effective concentrations of TR used were 150 and 200 microM, while concentrations of less than 50 microM TR were not adequate for 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50). Differences were found in the response of CFU-blasts to TR related to the type of underlying leukemia. Inhibition of CFU-blast growth was more pronounced in bcCML than in AML in both the BM and PB samples. The concentration of TR required to induce IC50 in bcCML was 50 microM, while the same effect in AML required a concentration of 150 microM. Analysis of the control samples also revealed that CFU-blasts from bcCML produced smaller numbers of colonies, though these differences were not statistically significant. It has therefore been demonstrated that TR has strong in vitro anti-leukemic activity, more pronounced in bcCML than in refractory AML. We thus feel this study gives further rationale for the clinical application of TR, and would strongly support this.","['Colovic, M', 'Sefer, D', 'Bogdanovic, A', 'Suvajdzic, N', 'Jankovic, G', 'Atkinson, H D E', 'Milenkovic, P']","['Colovic M', 'Sefer D', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Suvajdzic N', 'Jankovic G', 'Atkinson HD', 'Milenkovic P']","['Institute of Haematology Clinical Centre of Serbia, Koste Todorovica 2, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia. marcolov@eunet.yu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blood Cells/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2003/05/28 05:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/05/28 05:00'],"['2003/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383503001526 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00152-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2003 Jun 10;195(2):153-9. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00152-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GM1s uptake by HL-60 cells was affected by the structure of their ceramides. Resistance to removal with trypsin and the stoichiometry of [(125)I] cholera toxin (CT) binding indicated that the added GM1s were incorporated into the membranes of the cells used for the isolation of DRMs in a manner resembling endogenous gangliosides. The ceramide moieties of the GM1s determined their occurrence in DRMs and the dependence of their recovery in this membrane fraction on the amount of Triton X-100 (TX) used for extraction as well as on cholesterol depletion. The GM1s with sphingosine acylated with C(14), C(16), C(18) C(22), or C(24) FAs were similarly abundant in DRMs. GM1s acylated with C(18:1), C(22:1), or C(24:1) were less abundant than those acylated with saturated FA of the same length. GM1s acetylated or acylated with C(8) FA were detected in DRMs in the lowest proportion. Depletion of 73% of cell cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin significantly affected the recovery in DRMs of GM1s acetylated or acylated with C(8) or unsaturated FAs but not of GM1 acylated with C(18), C(22), or C(24) FAs.

The current study examined the offer of return of research results by analyzing consent forms from 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia studies of the 235 institutional members of the Children's Oncology Group. METHODS: Institutional review board (IRB)-approved consent forms from 2 standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia studies (Children's Cancer Group [CCG] 1991 and Pediatric Oncology Group [POG] 9407) were analyzed independently by 2 reviewers. RESULTS: The authors received replies from 202 of the 235 institutions that were contacted (85%). One hundred eighty-one institutions had CCG 1991 (n = 96) or POG 9905 (n = 85) protocols that were approved by an IRB. Most institutions provided contact information for the principal investigator (n = 175; 97%) and a member of the institution's research services office (n = 154; 85%). Only 5 (2.8%) institutions provided an indication of a participant's right to receive a summary of research results; most of these institutions provided details on how (n = 5) or when (n = 5) this was to occur. All of these institutions (n = 162; 89.5%) provided a specific statement offering new information that might affect a participant's decision to continue to participate in a study. Only 2 institutional consent forms offered participants the option to receive research results, and only 10 (5.5%) consent forms contained an unambiguous, specific statement offering to provide new information after the study was closed. CONCLUSIONS: Few institutional review board-approved consent forms explicitly indicate the right of research recipients to receive a summary of the results of the research in which they have participated.","['Fernandez, Conrad V', 'Kodish, Eric', 'Taweel, Shaureen', 'Shurin, Susan', 'Weijer, Charles']","['Fernandez CV', 'Kodish E', 'Taweel S', 'Shurin S', 'Weijer C']","['Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. conrad.fernandez@iwk.nshealth.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Consent Forms', 'Disclosure/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Ethics, Research', 'Humans', 'Patient Rights/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,2003/05/27 05:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/05/27 05:00'],"['2003/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11391 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jun 1;97(11):2904-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11391.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,,,"[""Children's Oncology Group""]",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Medical records of patients with precursor B-cell ALL from January 1996 through June 2000 were reviewed retrospectively for toxicity during the 4-week induction phase and the 2 weeks after the induction phase. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients age < 14 years were diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL from January 1996 through June 2000. Of the 156 evaluable patients, 106 were treated with prednisone and 50 with dexamethasone. Fifty-two patients received steroids, L-asparaginase, and vincristine, whereas 104 high-risk patients received daunomycin in addition to these 3 agents. The incidence of gastritis was significantly higher among patients receiving dexamethasone (P = 0.01); incidence rates of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and myopathy were similar for all treatment groups. Dexamethasone led to more weight gain than did prednisone (+11.9% vs. +5.4%; P = 0.002). Serious infections were observed in 27 (25.5%) and 18 (36%) patients receiving prednisone and dexamethasone, respectively (P < or = 0.2). Five patients, four of whom received prednisone and one of whom received dexamethasone, died of infection. The addition of daunomycin to treatment regimens increased overall toxicity (P < 0.01). When daunomycin was included in treatment regimens, toxicity was greater among patients receiving dexamethasone; in contrast, when daunomycin was not included, toxicity was equal for both treatment groups. Regardless of daunomycin use, there was no difference in the incidence of serious infection between the two groups. ALL treatment was not compromised by steroid-related toxicity in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of daunomycin led to a much larger increase in dexamethasone-related toxicity compared with the increase in prednisone-related toxicity. Although the use of daunomycin enhanced dexamethasone-related toxicity, this enhancement did not result in a higher mortality rate or the alteration of planned ALL therapy.","['Belgaumi, Asim F', 'Al-Bakrah, Mohammed', 'Al-Mahr, Mohammed', 'Al-Jefri, Abdullah', 'Al-Musa, AbdulRahman', 'Saleh, Mahasen', 'Salim, Mohammed F', 'Osman, Mohammed', 'Osman, Layla', 'El-Solh, Hassan']","['Belgaumi AF', 'Al-Bakrah M', 'Al-Mahr M', 'Al-Jefri A', 'Al-Musa A', 'Saleh M', 'Salim MF', 'Osman M', 'Osman L', 'El-Solh H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

METHODS: The authors investigated the efficacy of imatinib in patients with these disorders. Forty-eight patients with AML (n = 10), MDS (n = 8), myelofibrosis (n = 18), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 7), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n = 3), or polycythemia vera (n = 2) were treated with imatinib 400 mg daily. RESULTS: None of the patients with AML or MDS responded. Among patients with myelofibrosis, 10 of 14 patients with splenomegaly (71%) had a 30% or greater reduction in spleen size, 1 patient had trilineage hematologic improvement, 2 had erythroid hematologic improvement, and 1 had improvement in platelet count. One patient with atypical CML had erythroid hematologic improvement. Both patients with polycythemia vera needed fewer phlebotomies (from 2-3 per year to none during the 8 months of therapy and from 3-6 per year to 1 during 9 months of therapy). None of the three patients with CMML responded. Treatment was well tolerated. The side effects were similar to those observed in patients with CML. CONCLUSIONS: Within these small subgroups of disease types, single-agent imatinib did not achieve a significant clinical response among patients with AML, MDS, atypical CML, or CMML without PDGF-R fusion genes. Preliminary data on polycythemia vera are promising and deserve further investigation. Responses among myelofibrosis patients were minor. Therefore, a combination treatment regimen including imatinib may be more effective.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Letvak, Laurie', 'Salvado, August', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Giles F', ""O'Brien S"", 'Thomas D', 'Albitar M', 'Rios MB', 'Talpaz M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Faderl S', 'Letvak L', 'Salvado A', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

METHODS: Data were collected from 102 patients with HL who were treated with the HDS regimen at 14 centers associated with the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi. Twenty-four patients had primary refractory HL, 59 patients had their first recurrence of HL (within 1 year in 32 patients and > 1 year in 27 patients), and 19 patients had multiple disease recurrences. The HDS regimen included the sequential delivery of high-dose (hd) cyclophosphamide with PBPC harvesting, methotrexate, etoposide, then HDT (usually hd mitoxantrone plus L-phenylalanine mustard) with PBPC autografting. In addition, radiotherapy was delivered to 36 patients at sites of bulky or persistent disease. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (90%) completed the HDS program. There were five toxic deaths (treatment-related mortality rate, 4.9%) and six secondary malignan cies (five patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia, and one patient developed colorectal carcinoma). At a median follow-up of 5 years, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) projections were 64% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 54-74%) and 53% (95% CI, 43-63%), respectively. Patients with their first recurrence had the most favorable outcome, with 5-year OS and EFS projections of 77% (95% CI, 66-88%) and 63% (95% CI, 50-76%), respectively. There were no significant differences between patients with early first recurrence and late first recurrence. The poorest outcome was observed in patients with refractory HL, with 5-year OS and EFS projections of 36% (95% CI, 16-55%) and 33% (95% CI, 14-52%), respectively. Patients who received HDS chemotherapy after multiple recurrences had an intermediate outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that refractory disease and systemic symptoms at the time of initial presentation were associated significantly associated with poor OS and EFS. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HDS chemotherapy for patients with refractory and/or recurrent HL is feasible at the multicenter level. The combination of intensive debulking and HDT with PBPC autografting offers a good chance of prolonged disease free survival for patients with their first recurrence of HL.","['Tarella, Corrado', 'Cuttica, Alessandra', 'Vitolo, Umberto', 'Liberati, Marina', 'Di Nicola, Massimo', 'Cortelazzo, Sergio', 'Rosato, Rosalba', 'Rosanelli, Carlo', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Musso, Maurizio', 'Pavone, Enzo', 'Santini, Gino', 'Pescarollo, Alessandra', 'De Crescenzo, Alberto', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Gallamini, Andrea', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Romano, Roberta', 'Coser, Paolo', 'Gallo, Eugenio', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Pileri, Alessandro', 'Gianni, Alessandro M', 'Levis, Alessandro']","['Tarella C', 'Cuttica A', 'Vitolo U', 'Liberati M', 'Di Nicola M', 'Cortelazzo S', 'Rosato R', 'Rosanelli C', 'Di Renzo N', 'Musso M', 'Pavone E', 'Santini G', 'Pescarollo A', 'De Crescenzo A', 'Federico M', 'Gallamini A', 'Pregno P', 'Romano R', 'Coser P', 'Gallo E', 'Boccadoro M', 'Barbui T', 'Pileri A', 'Gianni AM', 'Levis A']","['Dipartimento Medicina-Oncologia Sperimentale, Divisione Universitaria di Ematologia, Torino, Italy. corrado.tarella@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/27 05:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/05/27 05:00'],"['2003/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11414 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Jun 1;97(11):2748-59. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11414.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LTC(4) S activity in rat basophilic leukemia-1 (RBL-1) cells increased after culture in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) analogues, which was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D (ACD). Unexpectedly, the co-addition of a low dose of ACD with RA further potentiated the upregulation of the LTC(4) S activity. Daunorubicin and mitomycin C also had a similar effect. When stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, control cells did not produce cysLTs, but RA-treated cells generated cysLTs and the co-addition of ACD further increased. While LTC(4) S mRNA and protein increased in the cells treated with RA, the co-addition of ACD further potentiated both in proportion to the LTC(4) S activity. The effect of ACD was considered to enhance the transcription rate of LTC(4) S gene, but not the mRNA-stability. The addition of methylprednisolone (MP) inhibited generation of cysLTs from the cells with A23187-stimulation and also did LTC(4) S activity, but did not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). The suppression of LTC(4) S with MP showed a dependent manner on the time-point and duration of MP-treatment after RA-addition which was correlated with reduction in LTC(4) S mRNA and protein. The cells cultured with RA plus ACD contained more histamine, chymase activity, and granules in the cytoplasm than the control cells, suggesting differentiation to mature mast cells. In consideration of RA-differentiation therapy, it may be of pathophysiological relevance that the antineoplastic agents potentiate RA-induced, steroid-sensitive, induction of LTC(4) S in RBL-1 cells.","['Abe, Masayoshi', 'Shibata, Kazuhiko', 'Urata, Hidenori', 'Sakata, Noriyuki', 'Katsuragi, Takeshi']","['Abe M', 'Shibata K', 'Urata H', 'Sakata N', 'Katsuragi T']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan. abemasa@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Chymases', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione Transferase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Methylprednisolone/*pharmacology', 'RNA Stability/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2003/05/27 05:00,2003/07/17 05:00,['2003/05/27 05:00'],"['2003/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10285 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2003 Jul;196(1):154-64. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10285.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an endeavor to reduce procedure-related toxicity, this study retrospectively evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of T cell depletion by counterflow centrifugal elutriation before alloBMT. Fifty-one patients with stage II (6) or III (45) multiple myeloma received alloBMTs using T cell depletion by elutriation. Fifty-three percent (27 of 51) of patients had primary refractory disease at the time of transplantation, 10% (5 of 51) had relapsed disease, and 4% (2 of 51) had refractory relapsed disease. The median age was 49 (range, 32 to 62) years, and the median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 9 (range, 4 to 58) months. Patients had received a median of 1 (range, 1 to 3) regimen and 4 (range, 2 to 16) cycles of chemotherapy. In this population, transplant-related mortality rate was 24% (12 of 51) with 2 patients dying of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thirty-one of 39 evaluable patients have experienced relapse, and the probability of progression-free survival 5 years after alloBMT alone is 16%. Sixteen patients were given donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) at the time of relapse (n = 11) or for persistent disease 1 year after transplantation (n = 5). Acute or chronic GVHD was seen in 63% (10 of 16) of patients given DLI. Responses were seen in 8 of 16 patients (6 complete response [CR], 2 partial response [PR]) with 6 of 8 responding patients having GVHD. Five recipients of DLI remain in a continuous CR, ranging from 3 to 64 months in duration. Thus, like chronic myelogenous leukemia, allogeneic T cells appear to have potent antimyeloma activity that is critical for achieving a cure. DLI-induced remissions of multiple myeloma can be durable, even in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemia, the antimyeloma effect of allogeneic T cells rarely occurs in the absence of clinically significant GVHD.","['Huff, Carol Ann', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'Noga, Stephen J', ""O'Donnell, Paul V"", 'Ambinder, Richard F', 'Diehl, Louis', 'Borrello, Ivan', 'Vogelsang, Georgia B', 'Miller, Carole B', 'Flinn, Ian A', 'Brodsky, Robert A', 'Marcellus, Deborah', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Huff CA', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Noga SJ', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Ambinder RF', 'Diehl L', 'Borrello I', 'Vogelsang GB', 'Miller CB', 'Flinn IA', 'Brodsky RA', 'Marcellus D', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins University, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Oncology, Baltimore, MD, USA. huffca@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/27 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/05/27 05:00'],"['2003/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879103000752 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00075-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 May;9(5):312-9. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00075-2.,,,['CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is substantial evidence that TNF-alpha also plays a role in the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, which along with leukemia relapse remains one of the 2 major impediments to success of the approach. Using a recently developed potent rat/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against murine TNF-alpha (CNTO2213), the authors investigated the effect of TNF-alpha blockade on GVHD mediated by either CD4(+) or CD8(+) donor T cells. The results indicated that the treatment had only a moderate effect on both a CD8(+) T cell-mediated major histocompatibility complex-matched GVHD model involving multiple minor histocompatibility antigens and a p-->F(1) acute GVHD model directed against a haplo-mismatched major histocompatibility complex barrier involving both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, treatment with the anti-TNF-alpha antibody had a highly significant effect (100% survival rate) on the CD4(+) T cell-mediated component of this latter model. Importantly, anti-TNF-alpha antibody did not block the development of a graft-versus-leukemia effect against a murine myeloid leukemia challenge in either a syngeneic or allogeneic p-->F(1) setting. This suggests that the inhibition of TNF-alpha during allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation may be able to diminish the inflammatory GVHD reaction without hindering effective graft-versus-leukemia responses.","['Korngold, Robert', 'Marini, Joseph C', 'de Baca, Monica E', 'Murphy, George F', 'Giles-Komar, Jill']","['Korngold R', 'Marini JC', 'de Baca ME', 'Murphy GF', 'Giles-Komar J']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

IFNs were the first human proteins to be effective in cancer therapy and were among the first recombinant DNA products to be used clinically. Both quality and quantity of life has been improved in response to IFNs in various malignancies. Despite its beneficial effects, unraveling the mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of IFN has proven to be a complex task. IFNs may mediate anti-tumor effects either indirectly by modulating immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic responses or by directly affecting proliferation or cellular differentiation of tumor cells. Both direct or indirect effects of IFNs result from induction of a subset of genes, called IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). In addition to the ISGs implicated in anti-viral, anti-angiogenic, immunomodulatory and cell cycle inhibitory effects, oligonucleotide microarray studies have identified ISGs with apoptotic functions. These include TNF-alpha related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L), Fas/FasL, XIAP associated factor-1 (XAF-1), caspase-4, caspase-8, dsRNA activated protein kinase (PKR), 2'5'A oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), death activating protein kinases (DAP kinase), phospholipid scramblase, galectin 9, IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) and regulators of IFN induced death (RIDs).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 750 percutaneous liver biopsies were performed at the Internal Medicine department of our institution during the 1995-2001 time period. The Menghini technique was employed previous ultrasonographic marking of the puncture site was performed by the same physicians who performed the biopsy. Major and minor complications as well as the diagnostic yield (obtention of diagnostic hepatic tissue) of the technique were recorded. RESULTS: No deaths occurred in our series. Two patients (0.3%) had major complications presenting as liver subcapsular hematoma with hemoperitoneum which resolved with conservative measures. One of them was a male patient with acute leukemia and the other was a woman on antiaggregant therapy. Eight patients (1.1%) had minor complications (vasovagal syncope), all of them young males. In three cases no adequate material for diagnosis was obtained (technique yield 99.6%). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, percutaneous liver biopsy with ultrasonographic marking is a diagnostic technique associated with a low rate of severe complications and with a high diagnostic yield. The use of ultrasonographic marking by the same physicians performed the biopsy does not involve a longer time or increased cost of the technique, provides more safety in the procedure and has a low morbidity rate.

Signal transduction by CNTF requires that it bind first to CNTF-R, permitting the recruitment of gp130 and LIF-R, forming a tripartite receptor complex. Cells that only express gp130 and LIF-R, but not CNTF-R are refractory to stimulation by CNTF. On many target cells CNTF only acts in the presence of its specific agonistic soluble receptors. We engineered a soluble fusion protein by linking the COOH-terminus of sCNTF-R to the NH2-terminus of CNTF. Recombinant CNTF/sCNTF-R fusion protein (Hyper-CNTF) was successfully expressed in COS-7 cells. The apparent molecular mass of the Hyper-CNTF protein was estimated from western blots to be 75 kDa. Proliferation assays of transfected BAF/3 cells in response to CNTF and Hyper-CNTF were used to verify the activity of the cytokines.

METHODS: Sixty-one patients with acute leukemia of initiatory treating were randomly divided into two groups, the 31 patients in the treated group were treated with SFI plus chemotherapy and the 30 patients in the control group treated with chemotherapy alone. The remission rate, changes of absolute number of peripheral mature neutrophils, T-lymphocyte subsets, serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha before and after treatment were observed. RESULTS: The remission rate was higher in the treated group than that in the control group but the difference was insignificant (P > 0.05). The restoring of peripheral mature neutrophils in the treated group was higher than that in the control group, from the 3rd week of treatment, the difference was significant (all P < 0.05). CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio after treatment increased in both groups, the increment was more obvious in the treated group than that in the control group significantly (P < 0.05). Serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha lowered in both groups after treatment significantly(all P < 0.01), but the decrement was greater in the treated group with significant difference to the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SFI could improve and regulate the immune function in acute leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy and enhance the therapeutic effect.","['Wei, Ying-fei', 'Du, Hui-lan', 'Wang, Su-yun']","['Wei YF', 'Du HL', 'Wang SY']","[""Department of Hematology, Hebei Provincial People's Hospital, Shijiazhuang 050000.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the measurement of these proteins could serve to monitor HCV related liver damage in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. PROCEDURE: A total of 34 ALL patients, 24 HCV-seropositive and 10 HCV-seronegative, who had had increased transaminase values (ALT) for almost 6 months were studied. Serum hPH concentrations were determined by an immuno-enzymatic assay kit. PIIIP was assayed by the radioimmunoassay method. RESULTS: Both hPH and PIIIP were increased in ALL patients with chronic hepatitis C. Serum hPH levels were significantly elevated in those with chronic hepatitis C with either normal or high transaminases when compared to those who never were HCV seropositive. The sensitivity and specificity of these protein measurements to evaluate hepatic fibrosis were not supported by histologic confirmation because only 6 out of 12 patients with chronic hepatitis had a liver biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that PIIIP and hPH values are significantly higher in ALL patients with chronic HCV with either normal or high transaminases. This might suggest that the liver damage is more marked in patients with chronic hepatitis and that the liver damage is related to the HCV rather than chemotherapy. Future studies correlating histologic findings with the serum biochemical markers are required to establish the sensitivity and specificity of hPH and PIIIP in predicting hepatic fibrosis and to confirm this association.","['Leonardi, Salvatore', 'La Spina, Milena', 'La Rosa, Mario', 'Schiliro, Gino']","['Leonardi S', 'La Spina M', 'La Rosa M', 'Schiliro G']","['Department of Pediatrics and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Catania, Via Santa Sofia, 78 95123 Catania, Italy. leonardi@mbox.unict.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Collagen Type III)', 'EC 1.14.11.2 (Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen Type III/*blood', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Liver Cirrhosis/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase/*blood', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survivors']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10309 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Jul;41(1):17-20. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10309.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of methods for the detection of submicroscopic levels of residual disease in patients with ALL mainly based on PCR and immunophenotyping has been developed, demonstrating that the presence of high levels of residual disease at the end of induction therapy is an important, independent prognostic factor. We determined the usefulness of PCR detection of minimal residual disease using consensus primers as a non-remission criterion. PROCEDURE: Bone marrow samples obtained from 49 children with ALL were analyzed at diagnosis and at the end of induction therapy for the detection of clonal IgH, TCRdelta, and TCRgamma rearrangements by PCR. The results were compared with those obtained by standard morphologic analysis and risk group classification. RESULTS: Patients who had clonality detected at the end of induction showed a significantly higher recurrence rate and lower event-free survival than those without detected clonality (24.9% vs. 89.7%) (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that detection of clonality at the end of induction was the most important, independent prognostic factor when associated with age, number of white blood cells, and immunophenotyping. CONCLUSIONS: PCR detection of clonality using consensus primers is a relatively simple technique that is able to identify patients with a high chance of recurrence, and shows a higher sensitivity and a better prognostic value than standard morphologic analysis and risk group classification, defining a new remission criterion. However, further multicentric prospective studies using this technique employing a larger number of cases are necessary to confirm these findings.","['Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Queiroz, Rosane Gomes de Paula', 'Bernardes, Jose Eduardo', 'Valera, Elvis Terci', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Scrideli CA', 'Queiroz RG', 'Bernardes JE', 'Valera ET', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ribeirao Preto Medicine School, Sao Paulo University, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor delta/genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10154 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Jul;41(1):10-6. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10154.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past two decades, basic and clinical scientists have been able to change this grim reality into a more hopeful outcome by replacing the diseased bone marrow with stem cells from either a family donor or an unrelated volunteer donor with identical human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Because of progress in this field, the initial experience of mainly using sibling donors has now been expanded to the use of either unrelated adult donors or cord blood cells as a source of hematopoietic cells. These approaches have created ethical concerns for donors and families, concerns that need to be discussed and understood by patients, volunteer donors and health care professionals.","['Fruchtman, Steven']",['Fruchtman S'],"['Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One East 100th Street, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Mt Sinai J Med,"The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",0241032,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy']",9,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mt Sinai J Med. 2003 May;70(3):166-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that adhesion of human myeloma and leukemia cell lines to the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin, confers a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Mechanisms associated with this cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance are drug-type specific. In the present study, we examined the influence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on myeloma cell response to the topoisomerase II inhibitor, mitoxantrone. Apoptosis was inhibited by more than 50% when cells were adhered to BMSCs as compared to myeloma cells maintained in suspension. To investigate the mechanisms contributing to the resistance of myeloma cells in contact with BMSCs, we examined the protective effects of BMSCs under four separate conditions: (1) direct cell contact; (2) BMSCs conditioned medium; (3) medium conditioned by coculturing myeloma cells in direct contact with BMSCs; and (4) medium conditioned by coculturing myeloma cells and BMSCs without direct physical contact. Conditioned medium from BMSCs alone was not sufficient to protect myeloma cells from drug-induced apoptosis; however, soluble factors produced during the myeloma-BMSCs interaction decreased the sensitivity of myeloma cells to mitoxantrone, suggesting a dynamic interaction between myeloma cells and BMSCs. We also found that myeloma cells in direct contact with BMSCs underwent growth arrest, whereas soluble factors produced by myeloma cells-BMSCs coincubation stimulated the proliferation of myeloma cells. These data show that both cell-cell adhesion of BMSCs with myeloma cells and soluble factors induced by this cell-cell interaction are involved in the protection of myeloma cells from mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis; however, the mechanisms contributing to the drug resistance are different.","['Nefedova, Y', 'Landowski, T H', 'Dalton, W S']","['Nefedova Y', 'Landowski TH', 'Dalton WS']","['Clinical Investigations, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Integrins/immunology/physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402924 [doi]', '2402924 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1175-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402924.,,,"['CA 76296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 82533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the biological effect of CD20 crosslinking on BL cell lines and observed that apoptosis induction is accompanied by activation of multiple caspases, including caspase-8, -9, -3, -2, and -7. Further investigation revealed a clear synergism between apoptosis mediated by CD20 and by B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). Examination of the effect of simultaneous crosslinking of other cell surface molecules with crosslinking of CD20 or BCR on apoptosis induction showed that these molecules had either a synergistic or inhibitory effect on induction of apoptosis. It is worth noting that some molecules had a different effect on CD20- and BCR-mediated apoptosis. Simultaneous crosslinking of the molecules CD10, CD22, CD72, and CD80 inhibited BCR-mediated apoptosis, but enhanced CD20-mediated apoptosis. Further studies revealed that regulation of CD20-induced apoptosis by other costimulatory molecules is achieved by modification of caspase activation. CD20-mediated apoptosis in BL cells may provide not only a model for understanding the mechanism regulating clonal selection of B cells but a new therapeutic strategy for BL patients.","['Mimori, K', 'Kiyokawa, N', 'Taguchi, T', 'Suzuki, T', 'Sekino, T', 'Nakajima, H', 'Saito, M', 'Katagiri, Y U', 'Isoyama, K', 'Yamada, K', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Fujimoto, J']","['Mimori K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Taguchi T', 'Suzuki T', 'Sekino T', 'Nakajima H', 'Saito M', 'Katagiri YU', 'Isoyama K', 'Yamada K', 'Matsuo Y', 'Fujimoto J']","['Department of Developmental Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 3-35-31 Taishido, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 154-8567, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402936 [doi]', '2402936 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1164-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402936.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on their expression or function during T-cell development is limited. Using degenerated RT-PCR and Affymetrix microarray analysis, we analyzed the expression pattern of this gene family in human multipotent stem cells from fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (ABM), and in T-cell progenitors from child thymus. We show that FL and ABM stem cells are similar in terms of HOX gene expression, but significant differences were observed between these two cell types and child thymocytes. As the most immature thymocytes are derived from immigrated FL and ABM stem cells, this indicates a drastic change in HOX gene expression upon entry into the thymus. Further analysis of HOX-A7, HOX-A9, HOX-A10, and HOX-A11 expression with specific RT-PCR in all thymocyte differentiation stages showed a sequential loss of 3' region HOX-A cluster genes during intrathymic T-cell development and an unexpected expression of HOX-A11, previously not recognized to play a role in hematopoiesis. Also HOX-B3 and HOX-C4 were expressed throughout thymocyte development. Overall, these data provide novel evidence for an important role of certain HOX genes in human T-cell development.","['Taghon, T', 'Thys, K', 'De Smedt, M', 'Weerkamp, F', 'Staal, F J T', 'Plum, J', 'Leclercq, G']","['Taghon T', 'Thys K', 'De Smedt M', 'Weerkamp F', 'Staal FJ', 'Plum J', 'Leclercq G']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, Ghent B-9000, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Fetus', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402947 [doi]', '2402947 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1157-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402947.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major transplant-related complications (MTCs) occurred in 33% of cases and included veno-occlusive liver disease, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, severe endothelial leakage syndrome and >grade II acute graft-versus-host disease. Compared with patients having minor complications, those with MTCs developed higher levels at times of maximal clinical signs (all cytokines, P<0.001), between days 0-5 post-BMT (IL-6 and IL-8, P<0.05) and days 6-10 (L-6, P<0.001; IL-8 and TNF, P<0.01) post-BMT. We could not discriminate patterns of cytokine release that were specific for any subtype of MTC. Higher levels of IL-8 during days 0-5 were associated (P=0.044) with early (<40 days) death. Multivariate analysis including patient and transplant characteristics as well as post-BMT levels of C-reactive protein showed that high average levels of one or more of the cytokines within the first 10 days post-BMT were independently associated with MTC (Odd's ratio: 2.3 [1.2-4.5], P=0.011).

Nectin 1 (CD111) is expressed on a higher proportion of mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) than cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells, and of CD34+/CD38+ cells when compared with CD34+/CD38- cells. We studied functional properties of human CB and mPB CD34+ cells that express low or high levels of CD111. CD34+/CD111(dim) cells contain a higher proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase than CD34+/CD111(bright) cells. CD34+/CD111(bright) cells contain more erythroid progenitors: CFU-E, than their counterparts, which on the opposite contain more HPP-CFC. Limiting dilution analyses demonstrate a higher frequency of immature progenitors: cobblestone-area colony-forming cells, CD34+/CD111(dim) than in CD34+/CD111(bright) cells. In vitro differentiation assays demonstrate a higher frequency of B-, T- and dendritic-cell precursors, but less NK-cell precursors in CD34+/CD111(dim) cells. Evaluation of engraftment in NOD-SCID mice shows that SCID repopulating cells are more frequent among mPB CD34+/CD111(dim) cells. Liquid culture of CD34+/CD111(dim) cells with erythropoietin shows that CD111 expression increases simultaneously with CD36, following CD71 and before glycophorin A expression. In conclusion, immature human hematopoietic progenitors express low levels of CD111 on their surface.

In the present study, we have explored the incidence of both typical and atypical iFISH patterns of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements in a series of 168 consecutive BCR/ABL+ patients--135 CML, 31 precursor B-ALL and two acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cases--and established their underlying genetic alterations through further molecular and chromosome analyses. Two different FISH probes (Vysis Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA) were used: the LSI BCR/ABL dual color extra signal (ES) and the dual color dual fusion BCR/ABL probe (D-FISH). Our results show that most BCR/ABL+ patients (83%, including 88% of all CML, 61% of ALL and one of two AML) displayed typical iFISH patterns of either Major (M) BCR/ABL (87% of CML, 13% of ALL and one of the two AML) or minor (m) BCR/ABL gene rearrangements (1% of all CML and 48% of ALL cases) with the two probes. Further molecular and cytogenetic studies confirmed the presence of such typical rearrangements in all except one of these ALL cases who had coexistence of an MBCR/ABL and an mBCR/ABL gene rearrangement together with monosomy 9. In the remaining 29 cases (17%), up to five different atypical iFISH patterns were detected with the ES probe. Atypical iFISH patterns were most frequently due to additional numerical changes--most often supernumerary Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (7%) but also gain or loss of chromosome 9 (1%) or 22 (1%). Deletion of 9q sequences proximal to the breakpoint were also frequently observed with the ES probe (8%). Application of the D-FISH probe showed that in most of these latter cases (5%) deletion of 22q sequences distal to the breakpoint also occurred. The remaining cases with atypical iFISH had cryptic insertion of BCR in 9q34 (1%). Exact interpretation of each iFISH pattern was supported by FISH on metaphases and molecular determination of the BCR breakpoint. In summary, our results indicate that despite the high incidence of typical iFISH patterns of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements, atypical patterns are also found in BCR/ABL+ acute leukemias; the precise definition of the alteration present in individual cases is dependent on metaphase studies and molecular definition of the breakpoint.","['Primo, D', 'Tabernero, M D', 'Rasillo, A', 'Sayagues, J M', 'Espinosa, A B', 'Chillon, M C', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Gutierrez, N', 'Giralt, M', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Orfao, A']","['Primo D', 'Tabernero MD', 'Rasillo A', 'Sayagues JM', 'Espinosa AB', 'Chillon MC', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Gutierrez N', 'Giralt M', 'Hagemeijer A', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio General de Citometria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Monosomy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402963 [doi]', '2402963 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1124-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402963.,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):161-2; author reply 162-4.

The molecular identification of genes involved in genetic alterations has led to the characterization of fusion genes with neoplastic properties. However, for many nonrandom translocations including the dic(9;12)(p11-13;p11-12), the molecular equivalent has not as yet been identified. The dicentric translocation dic(9;12) is a recurrent chromosome abnormality that accounts for close to 1% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This specific alteration occurs almost exclusively in B-progenitor ALL, and unlike many other nonrandom translocations, is associated with an excellent prognosis. In this work, we provide strong evidence that the PAX5/ETV6 fusion transcript defines the clinical and biological entity that is associated with the presence of a dic(9;12) chromosome. As the PAX5 and ETV6 genes are localized at 9p13 and 12p13, respectively, the cytogenetic description of the dic(9;12)-PAX5/ETV6 rearrangement should be refined to dic(9;12)(p13;p13).","['Strehl, S', 'Konig, M', 'Dworzak, M N', 'Kalwak, K', 'Haas, O A']","['Strehl S', 'Konig M', 'Dworzak MN', 'Kalwak K', 'Haas OA']","[""1CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402923 [doi]', '2402923 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1121-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402923.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three TTL splicing forms were identified, TTL-T from a human testis cDNA library, with an open-reading frame of 402 bp encoding 133 amino acids (aa), and TTL-B1 and -B2 from a human brain cDNA library. These proteins have no homology to known proteins. In leukemic cells from the patient, both reciprocal fusion transcripts, ETV6/TTL and TTL/ETV6, were expressed. The predominant fusion transcript, TTL/ETV6-1, encodes a predicted 530 aa fusion protein containing 89 aa of the N-terminal TTL fusing to the helix-loop-helix domain and ETS-binding domain of ETV6.

We observed high levels of p27kip1, cyclin D2, cyclin E, cdk2, and cdk4 expression in freshly isolated B-CLL cells. Despite high levels of cyclins and cdks, little cdk2 or cdk4 activity was observed with p27kip1 in complex with cyclinD2/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2. Remarkably, when B-CLL cells were treated in vitro with fludarabine, p27kip1 underwent caspase-specific degradation accompanied by an increase in cdk4 activity.

Hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) have been shown to recruit leukemic blasts into cell cycle. We postulated the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to EMA (EMA-G) might enhance treatment efficacy. EMA-G consisted of mitoxantrone on days 1-3, cytarabine on days 1-3 and 8-10, etoposide on days 8-10, and G-CSF from day 4 until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >500/microl. In total, 28 patients were enrolled. All patients had newly diagnosed de novo AML. The median age was 42 years. Of the 27 patients with cytogenetic analysis, six had favorable karyotype, 18 intermediate karyotype, and three unfavorable karyotype. The median follow-up was 37.5 months. The median time for both ANC recovery and last platelet transfusion was 26 days. The toxicities associated with this regimen were no more than those expected with the standard chemotherapy. In all, 24 (86%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), three (11%) patients had no response, and one patient died within 24 h of induction therapy before response could be evaluated. Of the 24 patients who achieved CR, 22 received high-dose cytosine arabinoside and two received allogeneic bone marrow transplant as initial postremission therapy. For the whole cohort, the estimated 3-year survival rate was 67%. The median relapse-free survival was 30.5 months. We conclude that EMA-G regimen is a safe regimen and administration of G-CSF during and after induction treatment is not associated with prolongation of marrow aplasia or acceleration of leukemia relapse. It is efficacious for induction therapy for newly diagnosed de novo AML. A high CR rate can be achieved with only one course of this chemotherapy.","['He, X-Y', 'Pohlman, B', 'Lichtin, A', 'Rybicki, L', 'Kalaycio, M']","['He XY', 'Pohlman B', 'Lichtin A', 'Rybicki L', 'Kalaycio M']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, 9500 Euclid Avenue, R35, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Palliative Care', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402955 [doi]', '2402955 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1078-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402955.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the necessity for leukemia cell CD1d expression, the role of alphaGalCer, and the cytotoxic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We evaluated these issues with myeloid leukemia cells from 14 patients and purified NKT cells that were alphaGalCer/CD1d reactive. CD1d was expressed by 80-100% of cells in three of seven acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and by 28-77% of cells in five of six juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias (JMML). CD1d+ AML cells were myelomonocytic or monoblastic types, and CD1d+ JMML cells were differentiated and CD34-. Cytotoxicity required leukemia cell CD1d expression and was increased by alphaGalCer (P<0.0001) and inhibited by anti-CD1d mAb (P<0.001). The perforin/granzyme-B pathway of NKT cells caused up to 85% of cytotoxicity, and TNF-alpha, FASL, and TRAIL mediated additional killing. CD56+ NKT cells expressed greater perforin and were more cytotoxic than CD56 NKT cells without alphaGalCer (P<0.0001), but both subpopulations were highly and equally cytotoxic in the presence of alphaGalCer. We conclude that CD1d expression is stage-specific for myelomonocytic leukemias and could provide a target for NKT-cell-mediated immunotherapy.","['Metelitsa, L S', 'Weinberg, K I', 'Emanuel, P D', 'Seeger, R C']","['Metelitsa LS', 'Weinberg KI', 'Emanuel PD', 'Seeger RC']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (CD1D protein, human)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD1/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD1d', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Galactosylceramides/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402943 [doi]', '2402943 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1068-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402943.,,,"['CA 22794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 81403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 54850/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using DeltaMEK1:ER, a conditionally active form of MEK1 which responds to either beta-estradiol or the estrogen receptor antagonist 4 hydroxy-tamoxifen (4HT), we previously documented the ability of this dual specificity protein kinase to abrogate the cytokine-dependency of human (TF-1) and murine (FDC-P1 and FL5.12) hematopoietic cells lines. Here we demonstrate the ability of DeltaMEK1:ER to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70(S6K)) pathway and the importance of this pathway in MEK1-mediated prevention of apoptosis. MEK1-responsive cells can be maintained long term in the presence of beta-estradiol, 4HT or IL-3. Removal of hormone led to the rapid cessation of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in a manner similar to cytokine deprivation of the parental cells. Stimulation of DeltaMEK1:ER by 4HT resulted in ERK, PI3K, Akt and p70(S6K) activation. Treatment with PI3K, Akt and p70(S6K) inhibitors prevented MEK-responsive growth. Furthermore, the apoptotic effects of PI3K/Akt/p70(S6K) inhibitors could be enhanced by cotreatment with MEK inhibitors. Use of a PI3K inhibitor and a constitutively active form of Akt, [DeltaAkt(Myr(+))], indicated that activation of PI3K was necessary for MEK1-responsive growth and survival as activation of Akt alone was unable to compensate for the loss of PI3K activity. Cells transduced by MEK or MEK+Akt displayed different sensitivities to signal transduction inhibitors, which targeted these pathways. These results indicate a requirement for the activation of the PI3K pathway during MEK-mediated transformation of certain hematopoietic cells. These experiments provide important clues as to why the identification of mutant signaling pathways may be the Achilles heel of leukemic cell growth. Leukemia treatment targeting multiple signal transduction pathways may be more efficacious than therapy aimed at inhibiting a single pathway.","['Blalock, W L', 'Navolanic, P M', 'Steelman, L S', 'Shelton, J G', 'Moye, P W', 'Lee, J T', 'Franklin, R A', 'Mirza, A', 'McMahon, M', 'White, M K', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Blalock WL', 'Navolanic PM', 'Steelman LS', 'Shelton JG', 'Moye PW', 'Lee JT', 'Franklin RA', 'Mirza A', 'McMahon M', 'White MK', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402925 [doi]', '2402925 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1058-67. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402925.,,,"['DK 45718/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, real-time PCR assays have been developed in order to quantify the number of tumor cells after treatment. However, these strategies are hampered by the presence of somatic hypermutation (SH) in VDJH rearrangements from multiple myeloma (MM) patients, which causes mismatches between primers and/or probes and the target, leading to a nonaccurate quantification of tumor cells. Our group has recently described a 60% incidence of incomplete DJH rearrangements in MM patients, with no or very low rates of SH. In this study, we compare the efficiency of a real-time PCR approach for the analysis of both complete and incomplete IgH rearrangements in eight MM patients using only three JH consensus probes. We were able to design an allele-specific oligonucleotide for both the complete and incomplete rearrangement in all patients. DJH rearrangements fulfilled the criteria of effectiveness for real-time PCR in all samples (ie no unspecific amplification, detection of less than 10 tumor cells within 10(5) polyclonal background and correlation coefficients of standard curves higher than 0.98). By contrast, only three out of eight VDJH rearrangements fulfilled these criteria. Further analyses showed that the remaining five VDJH rearrangements carried three or more somatic mutations in the probe and primer sites, leading to a dramatic decrease in the melting temperature. These results support the use of incomplete DJH rearrangements instead of complete somatically mutated VDJH rearrangements for investigation of minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma.","['Gonzalez, D', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Alonso, M E', 'Lopez-Perez, R', 'Balanzategui, A', 'Chillon, M C', 'Silva, M', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Gonzalez D', 'Gonzalez M', 'Alonso ME', 'Lopez-Perez R', 'Balanzategui A', 'Chillon MC', 'Silva M', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'San Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, P. de San Vicente 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['DNA Primers/chemistry', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402937 [doi]', '2402937 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1051-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402937.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative MRD data can be obtained with real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) analysis of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, breakpoint fusion regions of chromosome aberrations, fusion-gene transcripts, aberrant genes, or aberrantly expressed genes, their application being dependent on the type of disease. RQ-PCR analysis can be performed with SYBR Green I, hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes, or hybridization (LightCycler) probes, as detection system in several RQ-PCR instruments. Dependent on the type of MRD-PCR target, different types of oligonucleotides can be used for specific detection, such as an allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probe, an ASO forward primer, an ASO reverse primer, or germline probe and primers. To assess the quantity and quality of the RNA/DNA, one or more control genes must be included. Finally, the interpretation of RQ-PCR MRD data needs standardized criteria and reporting of MRD data needs international uniformity. Several European networks have now been established and common guidelines for data analysis and for reporting of MRD data are being developed. These networks also include standardization of technology as well as regular quality control rounds, both being essential for the introduction of RQ-PCR-based MRD detection in multicenter clinical treatment protocols.","['van der Velden, V H J', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Gabert, J', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Velden VH', 'Hochhaus A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Szczepanski T', 'Gabert J', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Dr Molewaterplein 50, Rotterdam 3015 GE, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/chemistry', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/instrumentation/*methods', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",232,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402922 [doi]', '2402922 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):1013-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAT-5 activation results in upregulation of bcl-X(L) and increased resistance to induction of apoptosis. Here, we investigated the effects of imatinib mesylate and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) on STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation, cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells. Imatinib mesylate treatment strongly suppressed STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation in K562 and primary CML blasts. In contrast to JAK-2 and PI-3-kinase inhibition, exposure of K562 cells to imatinib mesylate resulted in obvious suppression of proliferation. Reduced cell growth was due to specific induction of caspase activation followed by apoptotic cell death. In addition, we investigated the effects of Ara-C on STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation. Exposure to Ara-C resulted in significant downregulation of STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation and inhibition of DNA binding. Treatment of K562 cells with Ara-C in combination with imatinib mesylate revealed synergistic effects at the level of STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation and DNA binding, Hck tyrosine-phosphorylation, cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Overall, in this report we demonstrate that STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation is a specific target of imatinib mesylate and Ara-C. Our results suggest that, in combination therapy, inhibition of STAT-5 tyrosine-phosphorylation may be responsible for synergistic or additive effects on BCR-ABL-positive cells.","['Kindler, T', 'Breitenbuecher, F', 'Kasper, S', 'Stevens, T', 'Carius, B', 'Gschaidmeier, H', 'Huber, C', 'Fischer, T']","['Kindler T', 'Breitenbuecher F', 'Kasper S', 'Stevens T', 'Carius B', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Huber C', 'Fischer T']","['III Medical Department (Hematology/Oncology), Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, Mainz 55101, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402940 [doi]', '2402940 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Jun;17(6):999-1009. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402940.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase in the regulation of Bcr-Abl signaling was explored. First, expression patterns of tyrosine phosphatases in leukemic cell lines were investigated using degenerate primers for reverse transcription-PCR followed by cloning and sequencing of the cDNA. Distinct patterns of distribution of phosphatase were found in erythroid and myeloid leukemic cell lines. Whereas some phosphatases were ubiquitously expressed, others were limited to specific cell types. Surprisingly, a previously cloned ""lymphocyte-specific"" phosphatase, Lyp, was frequently detected in a number of myeloid cell lines as well as normal granulocytes and monocytes. Lyp was localized to the cytosol, and overexpression of Lyp caused reduction in the phosphorylation levels of multiple proteins in KCL22 chronic myeloid leukemia blast cells including Cbl, Bcr-Abl, Erk1/2, and CrkL. Co-expression of Lyp and Bcr-Abl in Cos-7 cells resulted in decreased levels of Bcr-Abl, Grb2, and Myc. Overexpression of Lyp markedly suppressed anchorage-independent clonal growth of KCL22 cells. Taken together, the data suggest that Lyp may play an antagonistic role in signaling by the Bcr-Abl fusion protein.","['Chien, Wenwen', 'Tidow, Nicola', 'Williamson, Elizabeth A', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Krug, Utz', 'Kettenbach, Arminja', 'Fermin, Anthony C', 'Roifman, Chaim M', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Chien W', 'Tidow N', 'Williamson EA', 'Shih LY', 'Krug U', 'Kettenbach A', 'Fermin AC', 'Roifman CM', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. chienw@cshs.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN22 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Agar/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M304575200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)84456-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jul 25;278(30):27413-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M304575200.

The subsequent recruitment of the common signal transducer glycoprotein 130 and activation of the JAK/STAT and SHP-2/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are responsible for the majority of cellular responses elicited by IL-6 cytokines. Several types of experiments suggest that the Src family of kinases (SFK) also participates in IL-6 family cytokine-mediated signaling events. SYF cells, which lack expression of SFKs Src, Yes, and Fyn, were used to determine the role of SFKs in IL-6 family cytokine signaling and gene induction. SYF and wild type (WT) control fibroblasts displayed similar activation of signaling intermediates following stimulation with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and subsequent activation of MAPK in SYF cells were identical to that seen in LIF-stimulated WT cells. Both LIF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, as well as LIF-stimulated DNA binding activity of STAT-containing nuclear complexes were indistinguishable when compared in SYF and WT cells. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-sensitive Akt kinase and p38 MAPK were activated by LIF in both SYF and WT cells. Furthermore, LIF-stimulated expression of c-fos, egr-1, and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 was retained in SYF cells. The IL-6 family cytokine oncostatin M was also capable of activating MAPK, STAT3, STAT1, Akt, and p38 in both WT and SYF cells.

One approach to overcome this problem is to selectively deplete the graft of alloreactive cells using an immunotoxin directed against the activation marker CD25. However, the degree of depletion of alloreactive cells is variable following stimulation with recipient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and this can result in graft versus host disease (GVHD). We have refined this approach using recipient Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) as stimulators to activate donor alloreactive T cells. Our studies demonstrate that allodepletion with an anti-CD25 immunotoxin following stimulation with HLA-mismatched host LCLs more consistently depleted in vitro alloreactivity than stimulation with host PBMCs, as assessed in primary mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs). Allodepletion using this approach specifically abrogates cytotoxic T-cell responses against host LCLs. In interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, antiviral responses to adenovirus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were preserved following allodepletion. Likewise, using HLA-A2-pp65 tetramers, we have shown that the frequency of CMV-specific T cells is unaffected by allodepletion. Moreover, the donor anti-EBV response is partially retained by recognition of EBV antigens through the nonshared haplotype. Finally, we studied whether allodepletion affects the response to candidate tumor antigens in myeloid malignancies. Using HLA-A2-PR1 tetramer analysis, we found that the frequency of T cells recognizing the PR1 epitope of proteinase 3 was not significantly different in allodepleted and unmanipulated PBMCs from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) undergoing transplantation. Based on these data, we have embarked on a phase 1 clinical trial of addback of allo-LCL-depleted donor T cells in the haplo-identical setting.","['Amrolia, Persis J', 'Muccioli-Casadei, Giada', 'Yvon, Eric', 'Huls, Helen', 'Sili, Uluhan', 'Wieder, Eric D', 'Bollard, Catherine', 'Michalek, Jaroslav', 'Ghetie, Victor', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J', 'Rooney, Cliona M', 'Schlinder, John', 'Vitetta, Ellen', 'Brenner, Malcolm K']","['Amrolia PJ', 'Muccioli-Casadei G', 'Yvon E', 'Huls H', 'Sili U', 'Wieder ED', 'Bollard C', 'Michalek J', 'Ghetie V', 'Heslop HE', 'Molldrem JJ', 'Rooney CM', 'Schlinder J', 'Vitetta E', 'Brenner MK']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, London, United Kingdom. amrolp1@gosh.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*virology']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3516 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50527-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2292-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3516.

Therefore, the search for agents that enhance the anti-Ph+ effect of imatinib mesylate is warranted. We investigated the combined effects of imatinib mesylate and the third-generation bisphosphonate zoledronate (ZOL) on Ph+ leukemias, because ZOL inhibited the prenylation of Ras-related proteins downstream of Bcr/Abl. First, we identified the potency of ZOL in vitro against human leukemic cell lines, including 2 Ph+ and a P-glycoprotein-overexpressing leukemic cell line. ZOL was also effective in vivo because as it prolonged the survival of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice who were given xenografts with Ph+ BV173 leukemic cells. Next, we showed the in vitro synergistic effects with ZOL and imatinib mesylate for Ph+ cell lines. ZOL combined with imatinib mesylate showed synergistic effects in vivo that prolonged the survival of mice inoculated with BV173. ZOL only minimally inhibited the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitors in vitro, and mice receiving ZOL or imatinib mesylate or both tolerated these treatments well. These findings indicate that ZOL is a potent antileukemic agent that augments synergistically the anti-Ph+ leukemia activity of imatinib mesylate.","['Kuroda, Junya', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Segawa, Hidekazu', 'Kobayashi, Yutaka', 'Yoshikawa, Toshikazu', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Ueda, Takanori', 'Enjo, Fumio', 'Tokuda, Harukuni', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Kuroda J', 'Kimura S', 'Segawa H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Urasaki Y', 'Ueda T', 'Enjo F', 'Tokuda H', 'Ottmann OG', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara-cho Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Pamidronate', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Prenylation', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Zoledronic Acid']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0305 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50518-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2229-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0305.

Our working hypothesis is that CD38 is not merely a marker in B-CLL, but that it plays a receptor role with pathogenetic potential ruling the proliferation of the malignant clone. CD38 levels were generally low in the patients examined and monoclonal antibody (mAb) ligation was inefficient in signaling. Other cellular models indicated that molecular density and surface organization are critical for CD38 functionality. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) induced a marked up-modulation and surface rearrangement of CD38 in all the patients studied. On reaching a specific expression threshold, CD38 becomes an efficient receptor in purified B-CLL cells. Indeed, mAb ligation is followed by Ca2+ fluxes and by a markedly increased proliferation. The unsuitability of CD38 to perform as a receptor is obviated through close interaction with the B-cell-receptor (BCR) complex and CD19. On mAb binding, CD38 translocates to the membrane lipid microdomains, as shown by a colocalization with the GM1 ganglioside and with CD81, a raft-resident protein. Finally, CD38 signaling in IL-2-treated B-CLL cells prolonged survival and induced the appearance of plasmablasts, providing a pathogenetic hypothesis for the occurrence of Richter syndrome.","['Deaglio, Silvia', 'Capobianco, Andrea', 'Bergui, Luciana', 'Durig, Jan', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Deaglio S', 'Capobianco A', 'Bergui L', 'Durig J', 'Morabito F', 'Duhrsen U', 'Malavasi F']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, via Santena 19, 10126 Turin, Italy. fabio.malavasi@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Microdomains/immunology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-03-0989 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50507-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2146-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0989.

Busulfan is a common component of pretransplant conditioning but has an erratic and unpredictable bioavailability when administered orally. Intravenous (IV) busulfan was recently introduced into clinical practice. Prior studies showed consistent and predictable drug delivery with tight control of busulfan plasma levels, avoiding over- and under-dosing. This study was designed to define the role of IV busulfan in different transplant and disease settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 43 patients with various hematologic malignancies conditioned with high-dose IV busulfan-containing regimens prior to allogeneic transplantation. The donors were HLA-matched siblings (n=24), matched unrelated (n=14), or 1-antigen mismatched related donors (n=5). Outcome parameters were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-two patients had initial engraftment. The toxicity profile was favorable. No patient developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver. Acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV occurred in 18 patients (42%). Six patients died of treatment-related causes, five of complications related to acute GVHD, and only one died of organ toxicity. Actuarial non-relapse-related mortality risk was 10% at day 100 and 18% at 2 years posttransplant. The actuarial 2-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 63% and 44%, respectively. Disease status other than refractory relapse, myeloid disease, and no severe GVHD posttransplant predicted for longer DFS in a multivariant model. CONCLUSIONS: IV busulfan-containing regimens allow consistent engraftment of allografts from related and unrelated donors such that myeloablation is administered with a toxicity profile typical of non-myeloablative conditioning. Favorable outcome was seen in patients with myeloid leukemias and in early or intermediately advanced disease; however, this regimen may not be sufficiently cytoreductive in patients with very advanced or active leukemia and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IV busulfan merits further study to better define its role as a preferred substitute for oral busulfan in pretransplant conditioning.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Bielorai, Bella', 'Toren, Amos', 'Hardan, Izhar', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Ben-Bassat, Isaac', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Bielorai B', 'Toren A', 'Hardan I', 'Avigdor A', 'Yeshurun M', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. ashimoni@sheba.health.gov.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X0300047X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00047-x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 May;31(5):428-34. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00047-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hematopoietic recovery after transplantation depends on the number of stem and progenitor cells in the transplant. Therefore, in the present study the effects of hyperthermic treatment on the human normal and acute myeloid leukemic (AML) stem cell compartment were investigated. METHODS: Normal bone marrow and AML blasts were heat treated up to 120 minutes at 43 degrees C. The surviving fractions of the different stem cell subsets were determined using in vitro methylcellulose and cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) clonogenic assays, as well as the in vivo NOD/SCID repopulating assay. The leukemic nature of the colonies from AML cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. In order to increase the therapeutic index of the hyperthermic purging modality, the heat treatment was preceded by a 3-hour incubation at 37 degrees C with the ether lipid ET-18-OCH(3) (25 microg/mL). RESULTS: It could be demonstrated that normal progenitor cells are far more resistant to hyperthermia than leukemic progenitor cells (56%+/-7% vs 9.9%+/-2.6% survival after 60 minutes at 43 degrees C, respectively). Furthermore, normal hematopoietic stem cells appear to be extremely resistant to the heat treatment (94%+/-9% survival after 60 minutes at 43 degrees C). In contrast, in the leukemic stem cell compartment no significant differences in heat sensitivity between the stem cells and progenitor subsets could be observed (12.3%+/-2.9% vs 9.9%+/-2.6% survival after 60 minutes at 43 degrees C, respectively). The combined treatment resulted in a survival for normal progenitor and stem cells of 32%+/-6% and 85%+/-15% after 60 minutes at 43 degrees C, respectively. Under these conditions the number of leukemic stem cells was reduced to 1%+/-0.3%. After 120 minutes at 43 degrees C, no AML-colonies could be detected anymore. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that leukemic stem cells have an increased hyperthermic sensitivity compared to their normal counterparts and that this difference can be further increased in combination with ET-18-OCH(3). These striking differences in heat sensitivity warrant the use of hyperthermia as a clinically applicable purging modality in autologous stem cell transplantation.","['Wierenga, Pieter K', 'Setroikromo, Rita', 'Kamps, Gera', 'Kampinga, Harm H', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Wierenga PK', 'Setroikromo R', 'Kamps G', 'Kampinga HH', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Radiation and Stress Cell Biology, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. p.k.wierenga@med.rug.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03000493 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00049-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 May;31(5):421-7. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00049-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyploidy is a result of endomitosis, a process that is characterized by continued DNA replication in the presence of abortive mitosis. Stathmin is a major microtubule-regulatory protein that plays an important role in the regulation of the mitotic spindle. Our previous studies had shown that inhibition of stathmin expression in human leukemia cells results in the assembly of atypical mitotic spindles and abnormal exit from mitosis. We hypothesized that the absence of stathmin expression in megakaryocytes might be important for their abortive mitosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental models that we used were human K562 and HEL cell lines that can be induced to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation and primary murine megakaryocytes generated by in vitro culture of bone marrow cells. The megakaryocytic phenotype was evaluated by flow cytometry and light microscopy. The DNA content (ploidy) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Stathmin expression was analyzed by Western and Northern blotting and by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our studies showed an inverse correlation between the level of ploidy and the level of stathmin expression in megakaryocytic cell lines and in primary cells. More importantly, inhibition of stathmin expression in K562 cells enhanced the propensity of these cells to undergo endomitosis and to become polyploid upon induction of megakaryocytic differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of stathmin expression interfered with the ability of the cells to acquire megakaryocyte-specific markers of differentiation. CONCLUSION: Based on these observations, we propose a model of megakaryopoiesis in which stathmin expression is necessary for the proliferation and differentiation of early megakaryoblasts and its suppression in the later stages of megakaryocytic maturation is necessary for polyploidization.","['Rubin, Camelia Iancu', 'French, Deborah L', 'Atweh, George F']","['Rubin CI', 'French DL', 'Atweh GF']","['Division of Hematology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', '*Polyploidy', 'Stathmin', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03000432 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00043-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 May;31(5):389-97. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00043-2.,,,"['HL54184/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P60HL28381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular and molecular studies of 12 SCN patients, including 5 patients that evolved to develop AML, revealed impaired proliferative characteristics and accelerated apoptosis of bone marrow progenitor cells in SCN compared with 11 healthy controls as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis. Sequencing analysis revealed heterozygous deletion or substitution mutations in the neutrophil elastase (NE) gene in 9 of 12 patients but not in healthy controls. Expression of various NE mutants, but not normal NE, resulted in accelerated apoptosis of human promyelocytic HL-60 progenitor cells, similar to impaired survival observed in patients' cells. Bone marrow-derived primitive CD34(+) and CD33(+)/CD34(-) progenitor cells from SCN patients evolving to AML, all with mutations in the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) gene, demonstrated normal cell survival, whereas more differentiated CD15(+)/CD33(-)/CD34(-) cells negative for mutant G-CSFR gene, continue to exhibit accelerated apoptosis. These data demonstrate that impaired survival of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells, probably driven by expression of mutant NE, is the cellular mechanism responsible for neutropenia in SCN. Furthermore, our results suggest that acquired G-CSFR mutations may initiate signaling events that override the pro-apoptotic effect of mutant NE in primitive progenitor cells, resulting in an expansion of the abnormal AML clone.","['Aprikyan, Andrew A G', 'Kutyavin, Tatyana', 'Stein, Steven', 'Aprikian, Pavel', 'Rodger, Elin', 'Liles, W Conrad', 'Boxer, Laurence A', 'Dale, David C']","['Aprikyan AA', 'Kutyavin T', 'Stein S', 'Aprikian P', 'Rodger E', 'Liles WC', 'Boxer LA', 'Dale DC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Wash, USA. apri@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neutropenia/complications/*congenital/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03000481 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00048-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 May;31(5):372-81. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00048-1.,,,"['1R01 CA89135-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2R01-DK-18951/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Exp Hematol. 2006 Dec;34(12):1771-2'],,,"['NIH Guide Grants Contracts. 2013 Apr 26;:NOT-OD-13-063.

The protein kinase Syk is an essential element in several cascades coupling certain antigen receptors to cell responses. Recently we reported that CD33 recruits Syk for its signaling in AML cell lines. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism(s) of Syk engagement in CD33 signaling in primary AML samples. METHODS: We investigated 25 primary AML samples for their proliferative response (3H-thymidine incorporation) and biochemical changes (Western blot analysis) to anti-CD33 mAb treatment. RESULTS: Proliferation studies demonstrated that 14 (56%) of AML samples were responsive (R) while 11 (44%) were nonresponsive (n-R) to inhibitory antibody activity. Seven of 25 AML samples (28%) expressed undetectable levels of Syk. However, cells from two of these patients expressed the ZAP-70 protein kinase. In Syk/ZAP-70(+) samples, CD33 ligation inhibited proliferation in 70% of cases, while none of the Syk/ZAP-70(-) samples was responsive. There were significant biochemical differences between responder and nonresponder AML populations. In responder samples, CD33 ligation induced phosphorylation of CD33 andSyk and formation of the CD33/Syk complex. In nonresponder samples, CD33 was not phosphorylated, and Syk was in complex with the SHP-1 protein phosphatase constitutively. CONCLUSIONS: Syk is an important component in the regulation of proliferation in AML cells. The differential response of AML cells to CD33 ligation is associated with the level of the Syk expression.","['Balaian, Larisa', 'Zhong, Rui-kun', 'Ball, Edward D']","['Balaian L', 'Zhong RK', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine and Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, Calif., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Stilbenes)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme Precursors/analysis/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*physiology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",,2003/05/24 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/24 05:00'],"['2003/05/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03000444 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00044-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 May;31(5):363-71. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00044-4.,,,['R01 CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second, the model includes a hierarchical extension to allow for meta-analysis over related studies. The random-effects distributions are decomposed into one part that is common across all related studies (common measure), and one part that is specific to each study and that captures the variability intrinsic between patients within the same study. Both the common measure and the study-specific measures are parameterized as mixture-of-normals models. We carry out inference using reversible jump posterior simulation to allow a random number of terms in the mixtures. The sampler takes advantage of the small number of entertained models. The motivating application is the analysis of two studies carried out by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). In both studies, we record for each patient white blood cell counts (WBC) over time to characterize the toxic effects of treatment.

Two cell lines, murine monocytic leukemia cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably overexpresssing human multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), were used as test systems. The modulation of P-gp and of MRP2 function was studied by the reversal of rhodamine 123 and of methylfluorescein-glutathione conjugate transport, respectively. Mechanisms that were not transporter related and could lead to misinterpretations were identified, such as probe quenching, probe encapsulation by micelles, and membrane damage. P-gp-mediated rhodamine 123 transport was inhibited by five nonionic surfactants in a concentration-dependent manner and in the order TPGS > Pluronic PE8100 > Cremophor EL > Pluronic PE6100 approximately Tween 80. In contrast, none of the surfactants showed a significant inhibition of MRP2-mediated efflux in Madin-Darby canine kidney/MRP2 cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that surfactants demonstrate a transporter-specific interaction, rather than unspecific membrane permeabilization. The present analysis offers insight in the possible mechanisms of surfactant interactions with biological membranes and could help to identify specific drug formulations.","['Bogman, Katrijn', 'Erne-Brand, Francoise', 'Alsenz, Jochem', 'Drewe, Jurgen']","['Bogman K', 'Erne-Brand F', 'Alsenz J', 'Drewe J']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital/Kantonsspital, Petersgraben 4, CH 4031 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*physiology', 'Surface-Active Agents/*pharmacology']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jps.10395 [doi]', 'S0022-3549(16)31255-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2003 Jun;92(6):1250-61. doi: 10.1002/jps.10395.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular events that arrest pre-B-cell differentiation in the leukaemic pre-B cells have not been well characterized. Here we show that the differentiation regulator SLP-65 (an adaptor protein also called BLNK or BASH) inhibits pre-B-cell leukaemia in mice. Reconstitution of SLP-65 expression in a SLP-65-/- pre-B-cell line led to enhanced differentiation in vitro and prevented the development of pre-B-cell leukaemia in immune-deficient mice. Tyrosine 96 of SLP-65 was required for this activity. The murine SLP-65-/- pre-B-cell leukaemia resembles human childhood pre-B ALL. Indeed, 16 of the 34 childhood pre-B ALL samples that were tested showed a complete loss or drastic reduction of SLP-65 expression. This loss is probably due to the incorporation of alternative exons into SLP-65 transcripts, leading to premature stop codons. Thus, the somatic loss of SLP-65 and the accompanying block in pre-B-cell differentiation might be one of the primary causes of childhood pre-B ALL.","['Jumaa, Hassan', 'Bossaller, Lukas', 'Portugal, Karina', 'Storch, Bettina', 'Lotz, Michael', 'Flemming, Alexandra', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Postila, Ville', 'Riikonen, Pekka', 'Pelkonen, Jukka', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Reth, Michael']","['Jumaa H', 'Bossaller L', 'Portugal K', 'Storch B', 'Lotz M', 'Flemming A', 'Schrappe M', 'Postila V', 'Riikonen P', 'Pelkonen J', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Reth M']","['Biologie III, University of Freiburg and Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany. jumaa@immunbio.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/pathology']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nature01608 [doi]', 'nature01608 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2003 May 22;423(6938):452-6. doi: 10.1038/nature01608.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that HPB-ALL cells are normally resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis, and quercetin is able to sensitize this cell line through a mechanism independent of its antioxidant properties. In fact, other compounds structurally and functionally similar to quercetin, when associated with anti-CD95 antibody did not induce any CD95-mediated apoptosis, still maintaining their antioxidant capacity. We found that quercetin effects are mediated by the activation of PKCalpha. Treatment of HPB-ALL cells with quercetin slightly decreased PKCalpha activity, but when the flavonoid was associated with anti-CD95, the kinase activity increased by 12-fold with respect to the treatment with quercetin. In addition, overexpression of PKCalpha induced programmed cell death in the absence of any additional stimulus, while a kinase-defective mutant of PKCalpha was ineffective.

However, a number of recent studies in different cell types revealed other sites of action of 2-APB. In this study, we examined the influence of 2-APB on capacitative calcium entry and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3 m1) cells. 2-APB was found to inhibit capacitative calcium entry, but at concentrations greater than 50 microM, a new effect of 2-APB was observed. When capacitative calcium entry was blocked with Gd3+, 2-APB caused an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+. This increase in intracellular Ca2+ was not caused by altered buffering of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and was not caused by or in any way affected by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Associated with the increase in intracellular Ca2+, in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+, 2-APB activated single channels in the plasma membrane with a conductance of approximately 50 pS. These channels seem to be nonselective cation channels; monovalent cations are the major carriers of current, but finite permeability to Ca2+ leads to a significant intracellular Ca2+ signal.

Initially described as closely associated with infantile myeloid leukaemia, its incidence increased along the last decade. DESIGN: retrospective review. PATIENTS: 12 immunodepressed patients affected of acute typhilis in our hospital between 1994 and 2001. Suspected diagnosis was established by clinical symptoms and abdominal CT findings, and was confirmed with pathological finding in the surgical specimen. Clinical and radiological diagnosis, treatment, complications and survival of patients are discussed. RESULTS: 3 patients with a previous diagnosis af acute myeloid leukemia, 2 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 2 patients with aplastic anaemia, one patient with AIDS, and 4 patients with kidney transplantation were included in our study. Prednisone, cyclosporine, Ara-C and vincristine were the most frequently involved drugs. Most frequent clinical findings included abdominal pain, fever, nausea-vomiting and abdominal distension. CT diagnosis revealed caecum and colic involvement with rarefaction of pericaecal fat. Medical treatment was successful in only 33% of all patients, the other patients requiring a surgical procedure including right hemicolectomy with or without intestinal anastomosis. Mortality reached 58.3 per cent, representing multiorganic sepsis the main cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: although early diagnosis of acute typhlitis bears a better prognosis, mortality rates are up 50 % in spite of an established treatment.","['Bueno Lledo, J', 'Serralta Serra, A', 'Hernanadis Villalva, J', 'Planells Roig, M', 'Rodero Rodero, D']","['Bueno Lledo J', 'Serralta Serra A', 'Hernanadis Villalva J', 'Planells Roig M', 'Rodero Rodero D']","['Service of General Surgery and digestive II, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. buenolledo@hotmail.com']","['eng', 'spa']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Rev Esp Enferm Dig,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,9007566,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/immunology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/immunology', 'Cecal Diseases/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/mortality/surgery', 'Colectomy', 'Enterocolitis/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileostomy', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography, Abdominal', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Rev Esp Enferm Dig. 2003 Jan;95(1):30-4, 35-9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importance of detection of recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and multilineage dysplasia on survival.,672-80,"To evaluate the prognostic impact of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) classifications, specimens from 300 patients with 20% or more bone marrow myeloblast cells were studied. Specimens were classified according to the French-American-British Cooperative Group (FAB), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Realistic Pathologic Classification, and a cytogenetic risk group scheme. Cases with fewer than 30% blast cells did not have a 5-year survival significantly different from cases with 30% or more blast cells, and survival was similar for the low blast cell count group and cases with multilineage dysplasia and 30% or more blasts. Categories of AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities of t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), and 11q23 showed significant differences in 5-year survival. No significant difference was identified between AMLs arising from myelodysplasia and de novo AMLs with multilineage dysplasia, but all cases with multilineage dysplasia had a worse survival than all other AMLs and other AMLs without favorable cytogenetics. FAB types M0, M3, and M4Eo showed differences in survival compared with all other FAB types, with M0 showing a significant association with high-risk cytogenetics and 11q23 abnormalities. Other FAB groups and WHO AML, not otherwise categorized subgroups did not show survival differences. These findings suggest that the detection of recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and multilineage dysplasia are the most significant features of current AML classification.","['Arber, Daniel A', 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Carter, Nora H', 'Ikle, David', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Slovak, Marilyn L']","['Arber DA', 'Stein AS', 'Carter NH', 'Ikle D', 'Forman SJ', 'Slovak ML']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'World Health Organization']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/EM7K-CQR4-GLMH-RCX4 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2003 May;119(5):672-80. doi: 10.1309/EM7K-CQR4-GLMH-RCX4.,,,"['CA-30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation between VEGF expression and the FAB category.,663-71,"We studied vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in bone marrow sections obtained from 3 healthy donors and 41 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of various French-American-British (FAB) subtypes by immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-VEGF antibody. In normal bone marrow, the anti-VEGF antibody reacted with myeloid progenitor cells and megakaryocytes but not with erythroid cells or mature granulocytic cells. High levels of VEGF were found in the bone marrow in patients with AML-M1, -M2, -M3, -M4, -M4Eo, and -M5. In these leukemias, the vast majority of myeloblasts (> 90%) expressed VEGF. By contrast, in AML-M0, the percentage of VEGF-positive blasts was lower in most cases (median, 42%), and if at all detectable, these blast cells contained only trace amounts of VEGF. In AML-M3 and -M4Eo, maturing granulocytes failed to express VEGF similar to granulocytes in normal bone marrow. In AML-M6, myeloblasts exhibited VEGF, whereas erythroid cells did not. In AML-M7, blast cells and megakaryocytes were identified as major sources of VEGF. In summary, VEGF expression in the bone marrow is restricted to certain stages of differentiation and maturation of myeloid cells and correlates with the FAB category.","['Ghannadan, Minoo', 'Wimazal, Friedrich', 'Simonitsch, Ingrid', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Hauswirth, Alexander W', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Chott, Andreas', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Lechner, Klaus', 'Valent, Peter']","['Ghannadan M', 'Wimazal F', 'Simonitsch I', 'Sperr WR', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Sillaber C', 'Hauswirth AW', 'Gadner H', 'Chott A', 'Horny HP', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/331Q-X7AX-KWFJ-FKXM [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2003 May;119(5):663-71. doi: 10.1309/331Q-X7AX-KWFJ-FKXM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with ALL newly diagnosed between October 1994 and June 2000 at our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Fifty-three patients were evaluable. Induction chemotherapy consisted of VPD with (46 cases) or without L-asparaginase (7 cases). After complete remission (CR), consolidation therapy, CNS prophylaxis and maintenance chemotherapy were administered. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 16 to 67 (median 30). CR rate was 86.8% (46/53) and no significant prognostic factor was found for the CR rate. With a median follow-up time of 27.2 months (range 12.9-83.0 months) in living patients, the median overall survival (OS) for all cases was 16.7 months (13.4-20.1 months, 95% C.I.) and the estimated 4-year OS rate was 25.4% +/- 8.9%. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 12.2 months (8.4-16.0 months, 95% C.I.), and 3-year RFS rate was 29.9% +/- 10.2%. Poor prognostic factors for OS were Ph chromosome (p = 0.005) and T-cell immunophenotype (p = 0.03). For RFS they were Ph chromosome (p = 0.01) and the presence of a mediastinal mass (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Despite an initial excellent response to the VPD (L) regimen, newer therapeutic strategies, including more intensive postremission therapies, are urgently needed because of the high relapse rate. Future therapeutic approaches need to be stratified according to several prognostic factors.","['Park, Sook-Ryun', 'Kim, Jee Hyun', 'Kim, Do Yeun', 'Lee, Sehoon', 'Lee, Sang-Yoon', 'Choi, In Sil', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Kim, Byuoung-Gook', 'Kim, Noe Kyoung']","['Park SR', 'Kim JH', 'Kim DY', 'Lee S', 'Lee SY', 'Choi IS', 'Yoon SS', 'Park S', 'Kim BG', 'Kim NK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 28, Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-744, Korea. seonpark@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'VPD protocol']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Probability', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3904/kjim.2003.18.1.21 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2003 Mar;18(1):21-8. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2003.18.1.21.,,,,,,,,,PMC4531597,,,,,,,

Analysis of t (8;21) positive leukemic blasts has shown characteristic morphological and immunological features. We performed this study to investigate the incidence of AML1/ETO rearrangement in adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), especially in M2 subtype, to make a comparison of clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics between AML1/ETO rearrangement positive and negative group in patients with AML and to analyze the correlation with other biological parameters. METHODS: From May 1995 to Sept. 2000, fifty-nine patients with AML, including twenty-nine AML-M2, were studied. RNAs were extracted from leukemic cells and reverse transcriptase mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for AML1/ETO fusion transcript was done. Chromosome study, immunophenotypic and clinical characteristics were analyzed and statistical analysis was done. RESULTS: The incidence of AML1/ETO fusion transcripts was 22.0% in AML and 44.8% in AML-M2. The morphologic finding of bone marrow in AML-M2 showed higher incidence of Auer rods, large blast with prominent golgi and abnormal granules in AML1/ETO positive patients. There was no significant difference of immunophenotype. AML patients with AML1/ETO had a tendency of higher complete remission rate (81.8% vs 56.6%, p = 0.13). The overall survival (median; 82.2 weeks vs 34.4 weeks, p = 0.02) and progression free survival (median; 50.9 weeks vs 20.4 weeks, p = 0.02) of AML1/ETO positive group were longer than those of the negative group in AML. AML-M2 patients with AML1/ETO rearrangement had also a tendency of longer overall survival and progression free survival, although there was no significant difference between both groups. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that AML1/ETO rearrangement is detected frequently in AML, especially M2, and is a favorable prognostic factor. Thus, molecular diagnostic approaches should be used routinely to identify patients with this gentic subtype of AML.","['Cho, Eun Kyung', 'Bang, Soo Mee', 'Ahn, Jeong Yeal', 'Yoo, Seung Min', 'Park, Pil Whan', 'Seo, Yieh Hea', 'Shin, Dong Bok', 'Lee, Jae Hoon']","['Cho EK', 'Bang SM', 'Ahn JY', 'Yoo SM', 'Park PW', 'Seo YH', 'Shin DB', 'Lee JH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon Medical School, Gil Medical Center, 1198 Guwol-dong, Namdong-gu, Incheon 405-760, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Base Sequence', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/23 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/23 05:00'],"['2003/05/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3904/kjim.2003.18.1.13 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2003 Mar;18(1):13-20. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2003.18.1.13.,,,,,,,,,PMC4531607,,,,,,,

Two strains of monoclonal antibody to C33 were produced. By using one of them as coated and the other as HRP(horseradish peroxidase)-labelled antibodies, an ELISA was developed to detect C33 antigen of HCV in 1236 serum samples from patients. RESULTS: The detectable rate of peptide C33 was 14.0%(6/43) in acute hepatitis C group, 8.8%(35/396) in anti-HCV-IgG positive group, 6.5%(4/62) in chronic hepatitis C group, 4.3%(1/23) in leukemia group, 3.3%(19/576) in hemodialysis group, 1.5%(2/136) in other diseases group, and 1. 4%(6/438) in blood donors. Results of immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for liver tissues obtained from biopsy showed that C33 peptide was found in nucli, cytoplasm and membranes of hepatic cells, scattered or laterally concentrated in the cytoplasm.

We have identified a second case of MLL-AF5Q31 fusion, arising from an insertion of MLL sequences into chromosome 5, also in an infant leukemia patient. Because MLL and AF5Q31 are transcribed in opposite orientations, a simple balanced chromosomal translocation cannot produce a fusion protein, and complex chromosomal rearrangements such as insertions and inversions are required to produce an MLL-AF5Q31 fusion protein.

Using a microsatellite marker-based method, we have searched for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations at 3 genomic regions implicated in HLA class I expression in a cohort of 56 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples. The regions analyzed consisted of the HLA class I heavy chain genes located within the MHC genomic region on chromosome arm 6p, the HLA class I light chain (beta-2-microglobulin, B2M) gene on chromosome arm 15q, and the putative HLA modifier of methylation gene (MEMO1) located on chromosome arm 1q. Results revealed low frequencies of B2M (2/55) and MEMO1 (5/42) LOH but a high frequency of MHC LOH (19/56) that was usually associated with whole chromosome 6 loss (13/19). Cytogenetic data were available for 30 samples, including nine of those that exhibited apparent whole chromosome 6 loss. No cases of chromosome 6 monosomy were observed. We propose that whole chromosome 6 loss with reduplication of the remaining chromosome is common in ALL and that it is driven by the presence of tumor-inhibiting factors on chromosome arm 6p (the HLA loci) along with previously localized tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome arm 6q.","['McEvoy, Christopher R E', 'Morley, Alexander A', 'Firgaira, Frank A']","['McEvoy CR', 'Morley AA', 'Firgaira FA']","['Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University of South Australia, Bedford Park, Australia. chris.mcevoy@flinders.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10214 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jul;37(3):321-5. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10214.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) down-regulates Janus kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway activity and inhibits the biological effects of cytokines. SOCS1 has been shown to have tumor-suppressor activity, and methylation of this gene, resulting in transcriptional silencing, has been found in 65% of hepatocellular carcinoma and has been suggested to play an important role in the development of the cancer. The methylation status of the SOCS1 gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been reported before. In this study, we analyzed SOCS1 methylation in 89 patients with newly diagnosed AML and correlated the result with immunophenotypes, cytogenetics, clinical features, and treatment outcome. SOCS1 methylation was found in the leukemic cells from 53 patients (60%). Thirteen (76%) of the 17 patients with t(15;17) had SOCS1 methylation, whereas this gene was methylated in only one (11%) of the nine patients with t(8;21). The frequencies of SOCS1 methylation among various cytogenetic subgroups differed significantly (P = 0.014). Other clinical and laboratory parameters and the disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between patients with and without SOCS1 methylation. In conclusion, SOCS1 methylation occurs in more than half of AML cases, correlates with cytogenetic abnormalities, and may play an important role in the development of subsets of AML.","['Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Shen, Hwei-Ling', 'Lin, Shu-Wha', 'Huang, Sheng-Yi', 'Yao, Ming', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Shen, Ming-Ching', 'Wang, Chiu-Hwa', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chen CY', 'Tsay W', 'Tang JL', 'Shen HL', 'Lin SW', 'Huang SY', 'Yao M', 'Chen YC', 'Shen MC', 'Wang CH', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10222 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jul;37(3):300-5. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10222.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen (27.1%) of the 59 CML patients had deletions of the residual ABL gene on the derivative chromosome 9. During the study period, 32 of the 59 CML patients progressed to blast crisis or accelerated phase. Of these, nine patients had residual ABL gene deletions on the derivative chromosomes 9 and 23 patients had no deletions. The mean duration from first diagnosis to blast crisis or accelerated phase for the nine patients with ABL deletions was 32.8 months, and for the 23 patients without ABL deletions, it was 62.4 months (P = 0.017). The overall survival time for the 16 patients with deletions was 32.8 months, and for the 43 patients without deletions, it was 60.1 months (P = 0.164). ABL deletions were not detected among the 35 ALL patients (17 with major BCR/ABL, 18 with minor BCR/ABL), and it appears that this deletion occurs rarely or not at all in Ph(+) ALL patients, which is in contrast to the CML patients (27.1%). However, we detected two ALL cases with ABL deletion but without BCR/ABL rearrangement among 49 Ph(-) ALL and 66 Ph(-) AML patients. In conclusion, patients with ABL deletions progress to blast crisis or accelerated phase in a significantly shorter time than do those without such deletions. It is therefore suggested that the ABL deletion is an indicator of a poor prognosis in CML.","['Lee, Dong Soon', 'Lee, Yun-Song', 'Yun, Yeon-Sook', 'Kim, Young-Ree', 'Jeong, Seok San', 'Lee, Young Kyung', 'She, Cha Ja', 'Yoon, Sung Soo', 'Shin, Hae Rim', 'Kim, Yongsoo', 'Cho, Han Ik']","['Lee DS', 'Lee YS', 'Yun YS', 'Kim YR', 'Jeong SS', 'Lee YK', 'She CJ', 'Yoon SS', 'Shin HR', 'Kim Y', 'Cho HI']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Korea. soonlee@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Incidence', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10197 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jul;37(3):291-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10197.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,"['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Apr;42(4):433-4.

Molecular heterogeneity was recently demonstrated in the form of extensive deletion of chromosomes 9 and 22 material from the der(9)t(9;22) in 15% of CML patients. The deletions were associated with a worse disease prognosis. Further genetic heterogeneity is seen during the terminal blast crisis stage of CML, in the form of additional non-random chromosome abnormalities. These include most frequently an extra copy of the Ph chromosome, trisomy 8, and isochromosome 17q. We used the genetic heterogeneity of CML as a framework to explore a new technique for high-throughput assessment of locus copy number in malignancy. Multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) relies on the ability of numerous short (100-300 bp) DNA probes to be recovered quantitatively by use of a common primer pair after hybridization to genomic DNA. Derivative chromosome 9 deletions were successfully mapped in a CML cell line (MC3) and nine patient bone marrow samples by simultaneous hybridization of 10 MAPH probes. All results were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. MAPH was found to be informative in the presence of up to 50% of normal cells, thus establishing the sensitivity of the technique in clonal tumor cell populations. MAPH was performed effectively on DNA samples extracted from fresh or methanol/acetic acid-fixed clonal cell populations. Amplifications of BCR-ABL1 were also detected and quantified in four CML cell lines by use of MAPH probes specific for ABL1 exon 11 and BCR exon 1. Our results demonstrate that MAPH is a reproducible high-throughput method suitable for the assessment of genomic imbalances of multiple loci in tumor DNA samples with heterogeneous cell populations at a resolution of 100-300 bp.","['Reid, Alistair G', 'Tarpey, Patrick S', 'Nacheva, Ellie P']","['Reid AG', 'Tarpey PS', 'Nacheva EP']","['Department of Academic Haematology, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, University College London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Allelic Imbalance/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'DNA Probes/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/genetics/methods', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10215 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Jul;37(3):282-90. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10215.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These alterations have been associated with a poor prognosis. In our study, we analyzed the prevalence and the potential prognostic impact of these aberrations in a large unselected and well-defined cohort of 956 patients with AML. Results were correlated with cytogenetic data and clinical outcome. MLL PTD was detected by RT-PCR, subsequent nucleotide sequencing, and Southern blotting. The overall incidence was found to be 5.0% (48/956), whereas FLT3 ITD was detected in 19.2% (184/956). Sixteen cases were positive for both alterations. The rate of MLL PTD in FLT3 ITD positive patients was significantly higher than that in FLT3 ITD negative patients [16/184 (8.7%); 32/772 (4.1%); P = 0.025].

When restricted to this subgroup, the rate of MLL PTD in patients with FLT3 mutations was not significantly increased. No statistically significant differences were detected between patients positive for MLL PTD and patients negative for MLL PTD in the rate of complete remissions or the overall survival, although we did see a significantly shorter disease-free survival in patients age 60 or younger. In conclusion, although there is an overlap in the mutational spectrum in AML with FLT3 ITD and MLL PTD mutations, our data do not support a common mechanistic basis.

The recognition of the central role played by KIT expression in the development of the interstitial cell of Cajal and of the activating KIT mutations in the pathogenesis of GIST have been the keys for a more precise categorization of this long elusive clinicopathological entity. A Consensus Conference held at the National Institutes of Health in 2001 provided both an evidence-based definition and a practical scheme for the assessment of the risk of aggressive clinical behavior. This scheme is based on evaluation of the size and mitotic rate of the tumors, and its use is strongly advocated. On the basis of current data GISTs can be defined as a distinctive group of KIT-expressing mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, showing differentiation towards the interstitial cell of Cajal, also known as the gastrointestinal pacemaker cells. Metastatic GISTs have been a virtually incurable disease until the elucidation of the role of KIT mutations. STI-571 (imatinib mesylate) is a molecule that inhibits the function of various receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, such as abl, the bcr-abl chimeric product, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and KIT. Following its successful use in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, STI-571 has also proved extremely effective in targeting metastatic GIST. Data regarding the duration of the response to this therapy are not yet available, and therefore any overenthusiasm should be avoided.

PML stimulates p53 activity by recruiting it to nuclear foci termed PML nuclear bodies. In contrast, MDM2 inhibits p53 by promoting its degradation. To date, neither a physical nor functional relationship between PML and MDM2 has been described. In this study, we report an in vivo and in vitro interaction between PML and MDM2 which is independent of p53. Two separate regions of PML are recognized which can interact with MDM2. The C-terminal half of PML, encoded by residues 300-633, can interact with the central region of MDM2 which includes the MDM2 acidic domain. In addition, PML amino acids 1-200, which encode the RING-finger and most of the B box zinc binding motifs, can interact with the C-terminal, RING-finger containing region of MDM2. Interestingly, PML mutants in which sumoylation at lysine 160 was inhibited displayed an increased association with MDM2, suggesting that sumoylation at this site may be a determinant of PML-MDM2 binding. Coexpression with MDM2 caused a redistribution of PML from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this required the PML N terminus and the MDM2 RING-finger domain. These results suggest that interaction between the PML N terminus and MDM2 C terminus can promote PML nuclear exclusion. Wild-type MDM2 inhibited the ability of PML to stimulate the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-CBP fusion protein. This inhibition required the central, acidic region of MDM2, but did not require the MDM2 C terminus. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that MDM2 and PML can interact through at least two separate protein regions, and that these interactions can have specific effects on the activity and/or localization of PML.","['Wei, Xiaolong', 'Yu, Zhong Kang', 'Ramalingam, Arivudainambi', 'Grossman, Steven R', 'Yu, Jiang H', 'Bloch, Donald B', 'Maki, Carl G']","['Wei X', 'Yu ZK', 'Ramalingam A', 'Grossman SR', 'Yu JH', 'Bloch DB', 'Maki CG']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics', 'Spodoptera/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/09/11 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212215200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)84432-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Aug 1;278(31):29288-97. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212215200.

It has been suggested that transactivation of these specific cellular genes by leukemia virus U3-LTR may contribute to the multistage process of leukemogenesis. The U3-LTR region, necessary for gene transactivational activity, also contains multiple transcription factor-binding sites that are essential for normal virus replication. To dissect the promoter activity and the gene transactivational activity of the U3-LTR, we conducted mutational analysis of the U3-LTR region of FeLV-A molecular clone 61E. We identified minimal nucleotide substitution mutants on the U3 LTR that did not disturb transcription factor-binding sites but abrogated its ability to transactivate the collagenase gene promoter. To determine if these mutations actually have altered any uncharacterized important transcription factor-binding site, we introduced these U3-LTR mutations into the full-length infectious molecular clone 61E. We demonstrate that the mutant virus was replication competent but could not transactivate cellular gene expression. These results thus suggest that the gene transactivational activity is a distinct property of the LTR and possibly not related to its promoter activity. The cellular gene transactivational activity-deficient mutant FeLV generated in this study may also serve as a valuable reagent for testing the biological significance of LTR-mediated cellular gene activation in the tumorigenesis caused by leukemia viruses.","['Abujamra, Ana L', 'Faller, Douglas V', 'Ghosh, Sajal K']","['Abujamra AL', 'Faller DV', 'Ghosh SK']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/metabolism', 'Collagenases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', '*Virus Replication']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/07/08 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682203000692 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00069-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 May 10;309(2):294-305. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(03)00069-2.,,,['CA079397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this animal model of immunodeficiency, which shows many similarities to human AIDS, is also used to test the efficacy and toxicity of antiretroviral drugs, a method that allows the quantitative detection of both viruses would be very useful also if hampered potentially by endogenous viral sequences usually present in mice. While BM5d alone could induce the disease, the effect of BM5e on the immune system of diseased mice is unclear. A specific and reliable one-step RT-PCR method was developed for the co-amplification, with the same efficiency, of BM5d or BM5e with ss-actin used as an internal standard. The standard curves produced with cloned cDNA sequences (ss-actin and BM5d or BM5e) assure that all samples are analyzed during the exponential phase of the reaction. Using this new assay which provided a dynamic range of at least four-log-unit, the ratio of initial absolute amounts of the virus and ss-actin RNA was determined, obtaining quantitative information on virus-specific cellular-transcript in the lymph nodes and spleen during the natural history of the disease and during therapeutic regimens.","['Casabianca, Anna', 'Orlandi, Chiara', 'Fraternale, Alessandra', 'Magnani, Mauro']","['Casabianca A', 'Orlandi C', 'Fraternale A', 'Magnani M']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry Giorgio Fornaini, University of Urbino, Via Saffi, 2, 61029 (PU), Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Helper Viruses/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*virology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093403001046 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00104-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2003 Jun 9;110(1):81-90. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00104-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: With thiazole orange as a fluorescent dye, RPs were measured by analyzing the RNA content in platelets with flow cytometry and the percent and absolute counts of RPs were calculated. RESULTS: (1) The percent and absolute counts of the RPs in a normal group were (8.4 +/- 2.5)% and (16.8 +/- 6.8) x 10(9)/L respectively. (2) As compared with the normal group, the patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and hypersplenism had a significantly high percent and low absolute counts of RPs (P < 0.01). In patients with aplastic anemia, both the percent and absolute counts of RPs were at low levels (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). There was no difference of RP percentage between the patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes and normal controls, but the absolute counts of RPs in the former was significantly lower than that in the latter. There was no difference between the percent and absolute counts of RPs among ITP patients with different proliferative degree of MK in bone marrow. (3) In all the diseases mentioned above, it was shown that RP percentage returned to normal in the effective cases after treatment, but no such change was found in the ineffective cases. CONCLUSIONS: Reticulated platelet counts contribute to the aetiology determination of the thrombocytopenia. It is also a valuable diagnostic method and a monitoring marker.

Macroscopically, the mandible exhibited extensive osteolysis, with only a small amount of bone remaining around the tooth roots. The cut surface of the mass around the mandible consisted of neoplastic medullary tissue, in which osteogenesis was observed. The medullary tissue was composed of pleomorphic medium-sized to large cells, interlaced by collagen bundles. These cells had large, pale, round or ovoid, sometimes cleaved nuclei, with one or two prominent nucleoli. Mitoses were numerous. Electron microscopy showed that the cells in the medullary tissues were similar in shape to undifferentiated lymphocytes. Immunohistochemically, these cells were positive for B-cell associated antigen in the pre-B-cell stage. Our findings suggest that the horse had extranodal lymphoblastic lymphoma of suspected B-cell lineage, possibly originating from the lymphatic system of the gingiva.

This antimetabolite is able to induce in vitro gene activation and cellular differentiation by a mechanism involving DNA hypomethylation. SuperGen acquired worldwide rights to decitabine from Pharmachemie in the third quarter of 1999 for 4 million US dollars worth of SuperGen shares and income from manufacture upon the launch of decitabine. SuperGen announced in May 2000 that it had entered a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US National Cancer Institute (NCI). SuperGen will supply decitabine to the NCI, which will initiate and sponsor clinical trials in patients with solid tumours and haematological malignancies. The NCI will also conduct studies on decitabine's mechanism of action. In 2002, the US FDA has granted decitabine orphan drug status for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and sickle cell anaemia. In February 2003, the European Commission granted orphan drug status to decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine has also received orphan drug status in the US as a host-protective agent in the treatment of AML. Decitabine has been studied in solid tumours as well as in different types of leukaemia. In several phase II studies it has been shown to have very limited efficacy against solid tumours. However, decitabine has shown better activity in the treatment of haematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (preleukaemia). In March 2001, SuperGen announced that it had begun patient enrolment into its pivotal open-label phase III trial of decitabine in advanced myelodysplastic syndrome patients. The study, which will compare decitabine with standard care therapy, will be conducted at 15 medical centres in the US and will enrol a total of 160 patients. In March 2003, SuperGen announced that patient enrolment was complete. The study, which will compare decitabine with standard care therapy, will be conducted at 22 medical centres in the US and will enrol a total of 160 patients. A European pivotal trial is also underway for the same indication, and is aiming to enrol 220 patients. A phase I/II trial of 8 patients, designed to establish safety and efficacy in the treatment of sickle cell anaemia, has been completed at the University of Illinois, USA. Plans for additional studies of decitabine as a treatment for sickle cell anaemia are underway. Decitabine is also undergoing phase II clinical trials in Canada, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and in the US for chronic myeloid leukaemia and prostate cancer. Glasgow University in Scotland has conducted preclinical trials in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian and colon cancers. The results suggest that decitabine administration may reverse chemotherapy resistance in these cancers.

The ability of 13-cis-RA to prevent second primary malignancies in patients with carcinoma of the head and neck has also been demonstrated. Unfortunately, this intervention did not affect the primary tumor recurrence rates.

This role is primarily mediated by binding of retinoic acid to retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), a nuclear receptor that modulates the expression of multiple downstream targets via retinoic acid response elements. The importance of this signalling pathway in myelopoiesis is evidenced by the recurrent disruption of the RARalpha gene by chromosomal rearrangements in all cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Biochemical evidence suggests RARalpha performs two opposing functions, one as a repressor of gene expression in the absence of ligand, the second as a transcriptional activator in the presence of ligand, each controlled by multimeric complexes of transcription corepressors and coactivators, respectively. Here the molecular mechanisms activated by retinoic acid during myelopoiesis in the context of neutrophil development will be reviewed, together with some of the more recently identified targets of the retinoic signalling pathway.","['Gaines, P', 'Berliner, N']","['Gaines P', 'Berliner N']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. peter.gaines@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- ((CaM)-dependent protein kinase Ia kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoids/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",201,2003/05/22 05:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/05/22 05:00'],"['2003/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2003 Jan-Mar;17(1):46-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphohematopoietic organs and a part of the glandular tissues of C3H as well as C57BL/6 mice revealed positive signals for F-SU/GFP binding on the cell surface. In contrast, C4W mice, which is a partial congenic mouse strain carrying the Fv-4 (r) gene on a BALB/c genetic background, exhibited negative signals in most of the organs except for a very weak binding in the pancreas. The expression of mCAT-1 mRNA determined by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed a similar distribution in C3H, C57BL/6 and C4W mice. Most of the organs including lymphohematopoietic organs and glandular organs revealed significant expression of mRNA for mCAT-1 gene, while the liver, heart and muscle did not. The results from binding assay were consistent with the fact that Friend MuLV-induced pathogenesis was usually associated with lymphohematopoietic systems, although mRNA expression for mCAT-1 was rather ubiquitous. The discrepancy between F-SU/GFP binding and mRNA expression for mCAT-1 in lymphohematopoietic organs of C4W mice would support the receptor interference effect by the Fv-4 (r) gene causing the resistance of C4W mouse to Friend MuLV infection.","['Yamaguchi, S', 'Hasegawa, M', 'Suzuki, T', 'Ikeda, H', 'Aizawa, S', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Kitagawa, M']","['Yamaguchi S', 'Hasegawa M', 'Suzuki T', 'Ikeda H', 'Aizawa S', 'Hirokawa K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Aging and Developmental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc7a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pancreas/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Salivary Glands/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",,2003/05/21 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/05/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00705-003-0017-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 2003 Jun;148(6):1175-84. doi: 10.1007/s00705-003-0017-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sera were taken at diagnosis and tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: MMP-9 levels positively correlated with haemoglobin levels (P = 0.03) and platelet count (P = 0.03). No association was found with main clinico-haematological features representative of tumour mass, such as peripheral blood lymphocytosis, bone marrow histology, Rai substages and beta-2 microglobulin (beta-2m).

METHODS: Bone-marrow samples from 92 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were studied by high-resolution comparative genomic hybridisation (HRCGH) using dynamic standard reference intervals that enhance both specificity and sensitivity in the detection of aberrations. RESULTS: In 80 patients (87%) HRCGH revealed a total of 405 aberrations, mostly whole chromosome gains (n = 265) and partial losses (n = 80). The 25 leukaemias with a gain of more than five whole chromosomes by HRCGH harboured only 7% of all losses. With G-band karyotyping 59 patients (64%) had aberrations. HRCGH revealed more aberrations per patient than did G-band karyotyping (median: 3 vs. 1, P = 0.005), revealed aberrations in 27 of the 34 patients for whom the G-band karyotyping failed or was found to be normal, and specifically revealed more 9p losses (21% vs. 5%, P < 0.005), 12p losses (12% vs. 2%, P < 0.05) and 17q gains (11% vs. 1%, P < 0.01). Compared to the present study, the frequency of patients with aberrant karyotypes was significantly lower in previous conventional CGH studies (64% vs. 87%, P < 0.0001), as was the rate of partial aberrations per patient (1.1% vs. 1.7, P < 0.001), particularly with fewer 6q losses, 9p losses and 17q gains detected. CONCLUSION: HRCGH is superior to conventional CGH as an adjunct to G-band karyotyping as it detects recurrent aberrations at a significantly higher rate than both these techniques.","['Kristensen, Tim D', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Carlsen, Niels T', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Kirchhoff, Maria', 'Lundsteen, Claes', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Kristensen TD', 'Wesenberg F', 'Jonsson OG', 'Carlsen NT', 'Forestier E', 'Kirchhoff M', 'Lundsteen C', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/05/21 05:00,2003/07/10 05:00,['2003/05/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['072 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00072.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Jun;70(6):363-72. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00072.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel system, DiffMaster Octavia for differential counting of blood leukocytes, has been evaluated. The system consisted of a microscope, 3-chip color charge coupled device (CCD) camera, automated motorized stage holder, electronic hardware for motor and light control and software for automatic cell location and image processing for preclassification of blood cells using artificial neural networks. The DiffMaster test method, was evaluated on 322 routine blood samples (400 cells per sample) using manual microscopy as reference method. The results showed a correlation of determination (r(2)) of 0.8-0.98 for the normal cell classes and blast cells. The DiffMaster correctly preclassified 89% of all leukocytes with a good reproducibility. After verification of the cell classes, the agreement between the test and reference method was 91% whether the sample was abnormal or normal. The clinical sensitivity was 98% and specificity 82%. The sensitivity to identify blast cells was slightly higher with the DiffMaster than manual microscopy. Similar levels of short-term imprecision for the two methods were found for all cell classes. In conclusion this study shows that the DiffMaster can provide a decision support system which, together with a qualified morphologist, can generate leukocyte differential count reports of high quality.","['Swolin, B', 'Simonsson, P', 'Backman, S', 'Lofqvist, I', 'Bredin, I', 'Johnsson, M']","['Swolin B', 'Simonsson P', 'Backman S', 'Lofqvist I', 'Bredin I', 'Johnsson M']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg University, Sweden. birgitta.swolin@clinchem.gu.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,,IM,"['Automation', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count/instrumentation', 'Humans', '*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukocyte Count/*instrumentation', 'Microscopy/*instrumentation', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/05/21 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/05/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['516 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00516.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Jun;25(3):139-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00516.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using cell-free in vitro integration assays, polyamides targeting the conserved CA dinucleotide with cognate sites closest to the terminal base pairs were effective at blocking 3' processing but not strand transfer. Polyamides which efficiently inhibited 3' processing and strand transfer targeted the LTR sequences through position 9. Polyamides that inhibited integration were effective at nanomolar concentrations and showed subnanomolar affinity for their cognate LTR sites.

BCR-ABL is critical to the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and a subset of acute leukemias. The chimeric Bcr-Abl protein has constitutively elevated tyrosine phosphokinase activity. This abnormal enzymatic activation is critical to the oncogenic potential of Bcr-Abl. Initially, protein kinases were thought to be poor therapeutic targets because of their ubiquitous nature and crucial role in many normal physiologic processes. However, the advent of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), formerly known as STI571 and CGP57148B, demonstrated that designer kinase inhibitors could be specific. This agent has shown striking activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia. It also inhibits phosphorylation of Kit (stem-cell factor receptor) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. In addition, it has shown similar impressive responses, with little host toxicity, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which harbor activating Kit mutations, and in tumors with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The studies of imatinib mesylate provide proof-of-principle for using aberrant kinases as a therapeutic target and are a model for the promise of molecular therapeutics. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the function of Bcr-Abl and its normal counterparts (Bcr and Abl), as well as the impact of this knowledge on the development of a remarkably successful targeted therapy approach.","['Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Druker BJ', 'Talpaz M']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 422, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. rkurzroc@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Models, Animal', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic']",124,2003/05/21 05:00,2003/06/06 05:00,['2003/05/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['200305200-00010 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-138-10-200305200-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2003 May 20;138(10):819-30. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-138-10-200305200-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined sodium selenite induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell lines (NB4). Cell growth and viability were assessed by trypan blue exclusion and cell counting; apoptosis by DNA electrophoresis and analysis of intracellular DNA contents; reactive oxygen species and reduced glutathione in the cell were measured by lucigenin dependent chemoluminescent (CL) test and spectrophotometer; mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured by flow cytometry. Sodium selenite could inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis of NB4 cells. Sodium selenite could increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in NB4 cells and decrease the level of intracellular reduced glutathione, but caused no change in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Sodium selenite enhanced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), in parallel with the production of ROS. Finally antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibit the ROS production, MTP collapse and apoptosis in NB4 cells. Our results suggested that sodium selenite could induce apoptosis of NB4 cells through mitochondrial change mediated by production of reactive oxygen species within the cells.","['Li, Jian', 'Zuo, Lu', 'Shen, Ti', 'Xu, Cai-min', 'Zhang, Zhi-nan']","['Li J', 'Zuo L', 'Shen T', 'Xu CM', 'Zhang ZN']","['Hematology department, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking, China. leej93@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Trace Elem Med Biol,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),9508274,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', ""2315-97-1 (10,10'-dimethyl-9,9'-biacridinium)"", 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Acridines/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/21 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/05/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0946-672X(03)80041-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0946-672X(03)80041-X [doi]']",ppublish,J Trace Elem Med Biol. 2003;17(1):19-26. doi: 10.1016/S0946-672X(03)80041-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are 3 major applications of Flow Cytometry in the clinical laboratory: lymphocyte subset enumeration, CD34 enumeration and leukemia immuno-phenotyping. Pilot schemes for CD34 enumeration and leukemia immuno-phenotyping have revealed a considerable lack of consensus with a wide divergence in practices. The coefficient of variation in reported results from these assessments have been very large, ranging from 20-200%. Results for lymphocyte subset enumeration surveys are sometimes not much better despite having been around for a longer period of time. Quality assurance programs in Flow Cytometry are difficult to conduct and 3 or 4 concurrent factors are often cited as reasons for the large variability. The need for viable, functionally intact cells as suitable assay material is probably the biggest contributor to the large variability. This difficulty in providing stable cells for inter-laboratory comparison is compounded by the lack of consensus in testing methodology. Participation in a distant external quality assurance scheme is consequently not very helpful to improving the practices in the laboratory. Currently, there are more problems than solutions.

The analysis of solid cancer mortality in Japanese cohort, which exceeded the expected one in a dose diapason of 5-200 mSv, revealed a (quasi) plateau in a dose-effect curve and led to the conclusion that the nature of the overshoot is non-radiogenic. The analysis of supposedly dose dependent leucosis incidence in the limited low dose diapason in the Chernobyl cohort showed that the real coefficient of the excess absolute or relative radiation risk could not be received in the case because the larger part curve was placed under the control level. In supporting the principle of single hit in a cell nucleus as a base of microdosimetric determination of low radiation doses, the approach to objective delimitation between low, intermediate and high doses regions has been proposed.

It can serve for evaluation of the dose rate threshold regarding the safe chronic radiation levels in the environment.","['Rozhdestvenskii, L M']",['Rozhdestvenskii LM'],"['State Research Center-Institute of Biophysics, Russian Ministry of Health, Moscow, 123182 Russia. rol@scribph.ru']",['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Radiats Biol Radioecol,"Radiatsionnaia biologiia, radioecologiia",9317212,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleus/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupations', '*Power Plants', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Radiation, Ionizing', '*Radioactive Fallout', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radiometry', 'Time Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",,2003/05/21 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiats Biol Radioecol. 2003 Mar-Apr;43(2):227-36.,,,,Analiz dannykh epidemiologicheskikh issledovanii radiokantserogennogo effekta i podkhodov k opredeleniiu granitsy malykh doz v aspekte porogovosti biologicheski brednogo deistviia ioniziruiushchei radiatsii.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using immunohistochemical methods and a 10% cut-off, each protein was detected in a subset of PTCLs: BCL-2 in 46%, BCL-XS in 49%, BAX in 57%, BCL-XL in 57%, and MCL-1 in 65%. The mean percentage of positive cells for these proteins varied significantly among the PTCL types. Only two types of PTCL, ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma, had a distinctive pattern of expression; all were BCL-2-negative and MCL-1-positive. The mean percentage of BAX-positive and BCL-XS-positive tumour cells was higher in ALK-positive ALCL than in ALK-negative ALCL or other types of PTCL (p = 0.06 and p = 0.01, respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test). MCL-1 was detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.01, chi-square test) and at higher levels (p = 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test) in ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL than in other PTCL types. The apoptotic rate, evaluated by the TUNEL assay, correlated inversely with BCL-2 expression (p = 0.035). The proliferation index, assessed by the MIB-1 antibody, correlated with expression levels of MCL-1 (R = 0.42, p = 0.003), BCL-2 (R = 0.32, p = 0.027), BAX (R = 0.33, p = 0.014), and BCL-XL (R = 0.34, p = 0.015) (Spearman rank). In conclusion, BCL-2 family proteins are expressed by a subset of PTCLs and their levels correlate with some histological types, apoptotic rate, and proliferation index. Expression of these proteins may explain the poor response of many types of PTCL to standard chemotherapy. These proteins may also provide novel targets for experimental therapy.","['Rassidakis, George Z', 'Jones, Dan', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Ramalingam, Preetha', 'Sarris, Andreas H', 'McDonnell, Timothy J', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Rassidakis GZ', 'Jones D', 'Lai R', 'Ramalingam P', 'Sarris AH', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1346 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2003 Jun;200(2):240-8. doi: 10.1002/path.1346.,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data was taken from the last 3 World Health Organization (WHO) mortality statistics. Crude mortality rates were compared between the 6 WHO regions for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000. Proportional mortality and standardized proportional mortality ratios were calculated for the causes of death and types of malignant neoplasm deaths and compared between the EMR and the other regions of the world. Spearman coefficient rank-order correlation was calculated to detect significant correlation between the ranking of the main causes of death in EMR and the 3 basic demographic, socio-economic and health care indicators in the 6 regions of the world. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that approximately 9 per 1,000 of the world's population die annually. Africa and Europe have the highest mortality rates. The main causes of death worldwide are cardiovascular diseases, infectious or parasitic diseases, malignant neoplasm, infectious respiratory diseases and other respiratory diseases. In EMR, approximately 8 per 1,000 die annually. The causes of death in EMR can be classified into 3 categories. 1) Non-prominent in EMR as compared to other regions of the world. 2) Prominent in EMR and significantly correlated to the basic indicators. 3) Prominent in EMR but not related to the basic indicators. These include deaths due to wars, congenital anomalies, perinatal conditions, genitourinary diseases, endocrine disorders, road traffic accidents, cancer bladder, lymphoma leukemia CONCLUSION: The results of this study emerged the need for extensive epidemiological studies to investigate thoroughly the main causes of death influencing mortality in EMR, specially that they coincide with the health consequences of depleted uranium. Also, most of these health conditions were previously described among the United States and European veterans who served in the Gulf War.","['Shawky, Sherine']",['Shawky S'],"['Department of Family and Community Medicine, PO Box 115, Jeddah 21411, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. shshawky@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,,IM,"['*Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mediterranean Region/epidemiology']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2004/09/25 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2003 Apr;24(4):380-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Success rate and influence of thyrostatic medication.,347-51,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the response rate of hyperthyroidism to radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, optimum effective dose, effect of pretreatment with thyrostatic medications, etiology, ophthalmopathy, mortality and cancer incidence post RAI treatment. METHODS: Retrospective study analysis of 360 patients records who received RAI treatment (dose 5-15 mCi) for hyperthyroidism in Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar between 1984-1999, treated and analyzed. Follow-up data was available in 215 patients, with a follow-up range of 2-10 years, of these 84 were males and 131 were females, with an age range of 12-74 years. Eighty percent were toxic diffuse goiter, 13.5% were toxic multinodular goiter and 6.5% were toxic single nodule. Eighty-seven percent had been pre-treated with anti-thyroid medications. Free thyroxine4, and thyroid stimulating hormone were recorded at diagnosis; 6 months, one year and yearly post RAI treatment. RESULTS: The incidence of hypothyroidism was 55.8% at 6 months and 67.9% at one year. There was no significant difference in the response rate to different doses of RAI treatment groups (50-59%, p=0.46). The response rate was significantly higher in the group without pre-treatment with anti-thyroid medications (95% versus 80.9%, p<0.0001) and 27.4% of our patients had ophthalmopathy. There was no significant worsening or new development of ophthalmopathy post RAI treatment. Three of our patients developed cancer: one with colonic, one with breast and one with acute leukemia. The mortality rate according to the age group was linear in the positive direction of age and the highest was 74-year-old (10.5 per 10,0000 population). CONCLUSION: Radioactive iodine treatment is an effective modality for definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism with long-term cure approaching 80%. Response rate was not related to gender, etiology or RAI dosage. Pre-treatment with anti-thyroid medication reduces the response rate. Radioactive iodine treatment has no significant influence on ophthalmopathy, mortality or thyroid cancer.","['Ghadban, Wisam K', 'Zirie, Mahmoud A', 'Al-Khateeb, Daoud A', 'Jayyousi, Amin A', 'Mobayedh, Hassan M', 'El-Aloosy, Ahmed S']","['Ghadban WK', 'Zirie MA', 'Al-Khateeb DA', 'Jayyousi AA', 'Mobayedh HM', 'El-Aloosy AS']","['Department of Endocrinology/Metabolism and Internal Medicine, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar. wizz1963@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,"['0 (Antithyroid Agents)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antithyroid Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperthyroidism/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2004/09/25 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2003 Apr;24(4):347-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HHE treatment caused apoptosis of cells as evidenced by discontinuous fragmentation of DNA, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of procaspase-9 and caspase-3, and proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Pretreatment of Ac-DEVD-CHO, caspase-3 specific inhibitor, or cyclosporin A, a mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor, completely abolished HHE-induced DNA fragmentation. Together, these results suggest that HHE possibly causes mitochondrial damage leading to cytochrome c release into cytosol and activation of caspases resulting in PARP cleavage and execution of apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells.","['Kwon, Kang-Beom', 'Kim, Eun-Kyung', 'Shin, Byung-Cheul', 'Seo, Eun-A', 'Yang, Jeong-Yeh', 'Ryu, Do-Gon']","['Kwon KB', 'Kim EK', 'Shin BC', 'Seo EA', 'Yang JY', 'Ryu DG']","['Department of Physiology, Chonbuk National University, Chonju 561-756, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Medicine, East Asian Traditional', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['200304305 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2003.13 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2003 Apr 30;35(2):91-7. doi: 10.1038/emm.2003.13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although evidences for the proapoptotic activity of As(2)O(3) have been suggested in leukemic and other solid cancer cells, the nature of intracellular mechanisms is far from clear. In the present study, we investigated As(2)O(3) affect on the stress-responsive signaling pathways and pretreatment with antioxidants using HepG2 cells. When treated with micromolar concentrations of As(2)O(3), HepG2 cells became highly apoptotic paralleled with activation of caspase-3 and members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 MAP kinase. However, inhibition of each kinase activity failed to inhibit apoptosis by As(2)O(3). Addition of n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) effectively protected cells from apoptosis and significantly lowered As(2)O(3)-induced activation of caspase-3. However, neither NAC nor DPI was able to effect ERK or JNK activation induced by As(2)O(3). Guanidinoethyldisulfide dihydrochloride (GED) and 2-ethyl-2-thiopseudourea (ETU), known inhibitors of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), also suppressed the apoptotic activity of As(2)O(3). These results suggest that As2O3 induces caspase-mediated apoptosis involving a mechanism generating oxidative stress. However, activation of some stress-responsive signaling pathways by As(2)O(3) may not be the major determinant in the course of apoptotic processes.","['Kang, Shin-Hae', 'Song, Ji-Hoon', 'Kang, Hee-Kyoung', 'Kang, Ji-Hoon', 'Kim, Se-Jae', 'Kang, Hyun-Wook', 'Lee, Young-Ki', 'Park, Deok-Bae']","['Kang SH', 'Song JH', 'Kang HK', 'Kang JH', 'Kim SJ', 'Kang HW', 'Lee YK', 'Park DB']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine and Cheju National University, Ara-1, Jeju 690-756, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', '*Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['200304304 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2003.12 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2003 Apr 30;35(2):83-90. doi: 10.1038/emm.2003.12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This compound showed antiproliferative activities in a panel of thirteen human tumor cell lines with IC(50) values in the range of 0.25 to 0.51 micro M for leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and 0.33 to 9.26 micro M for solid tumor cell lines. The primary action of JIMB01 is to inhibit microtubule polymerization but not depolymerization. A 4 micro M concentration of the compound caused a complete inhibition of microtubule assembly in a cell-free reaction. An increase in the number of human hepatocarcinoma cells blocked in the M-phase was detected 12hr after exposure to JIMB01. The kinase activity of cyclin B1, which is responsible for the G(2)/M transition, was increased accordingly. Bcl-2 phosphorylation became visible, in a western blot, within 6hr in hepatocarcinoma cells treated with JIMB01 at 0.8 micro M or higher. JIMB01-induced apoptosis in liver cancer cells was confirmed by morphological methods, flow cytometry, as well as DNA gel electrophoresis, which clearly demonstrated DNA degradation in the form of a multiple-unit DNA ladder. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using nude mice showed that intraperitoneal injection of JIMB01 at 15mg/kg (with seven injections at 4-day intervals) significantly inhibited the growth of a human hepatocarcinoma (BEL-7402) by 66% in tumor volume (P=0.01), at least compatible to the inhibition by vincristine (43% inhibition), indicating good bioavailability of the compound in the circulation. Side-effects of the compound were not observed, and the body weight of the treated mice remained stable during the 4-week treatment. Since JIMB01 is a small compound, targets a specific molecule in tumor cells, and has promising activity against human hepatocarcinoma in vivo, we believe JIMB01 merits consideration for further investigation.","['Li, Jian-Nong', 'Song, Dan-Qing', 'Lin, Yi-He', 'Hu, Qiong-Ying', 'Yin, Lu', 'Bekesi, George', 'Holland, James F', 'Jiang, Jian-Dong']","['Li JN', 'Song DQ', 'Lin YH', 'Hu QY', 'Yin L', 'Bekesi G', 'Holland JF', 'Jiang JD']","['Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100050, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (3-bromopropionylamino benzoylurea)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccnb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urea/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203001011 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00101-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 May 15;65(10):1691-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00101-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BMT was achieved in six out of the seven subjects; the exception was a subject with borderline personality disorder. Psychiatric treatments, including medication, to improve and maintain mental status appeared to be critical for the achievement of BMT in several patients.

So far, it is not clear whether IgE antibodies are involved in protection, pathology or both. We established a bioassay to detect reactive IgE antibodies in jirds infected with the filaria Acanthocheilonema viteae. Sera of A. viteae-infected jirds were used to sensitize rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) cells and degranulation was stimulated by addition of antigens of A. viteae. Reactive IgE responses were detected from 2 weeks post infection (p.i.) and throughout the A. viteae infection. Male antigen triggered the strongest mediator release, followed by female worms, infective larvae (L3) and microfilariae. Separation of male and female antigen indicated that several antigens of both genders are potent allergens. In particular, one male specific allergen of about 550 kDa induced strongest degranulation of RBL cells. In addition, mediator release stimulated by antigen fractions of about 15 kDa was due to filarial cystatin. In conclusion, we describe a convenient in vitro assay to examine IgE mediated responses in jirds. A sex specific filarial protein with high allergenic potential is identified and cystatin is established as a potent allergen of A. viteae.","['Hartmann, Susanne', 'Sollwedel, Andre', 'Hoffmann, Andreas', 'Sonnenburg, Bettina', 'Lucius, Richard']","['Hartmann S', 'Sollwedel A', 'Hoffmann A', 'Sonnenburg B', 'Lucius R']","['Humboldt-University, 10115 Berlin, Germany. susanne.hartmann@rz.hu-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Parasite Immunol,Parasite immunology,7910948,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Helminth)', '0 (Antigens, Helminth)', '0 (Cystatins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Helminth/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Helminth/*immunology', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cystatins/analysis/immunology', 'Dipetalonema/*immunology', 'Dipetalonema Infections/*immunology', 'Female', 'Filariasis/*immunology', 'Gerbillinae', 'Immunoglobulin E/analysis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Rats']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['496 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3024.2003.00496.x [doi]']",ppublish,Parasite Immunol. 2003 Jan;25(1):9-16. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3024.2003.00496.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying this differentiation have remained an enigma due to insufficient numbers of primary mesenchymal cells that must be isolated manually from animal embryos. To overcome this problem, we have established a conditionally immortalized cell line, the rat-inducible metanephric mesenchyme (RIMM-18) by transfection of primary mesenchymal cells with a vector, encoding an estradiol-dependent E1A-ER fusion protein. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), luciferase reporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunocytochemical, and immunohistochemical stainings were used to characterize the established cell line. RESULTS: We demonstrate that in the presence of estradiol, the RIMM-18 cell line proliferates continuously, maintaining mesenchymal characteristics for over 40 passages. These cells are vimentin-positive and cytokeratin-negative. Under inductive conditions in the absence of estradiol, they are responsive to a number of cytokines, which are established inducers of mesenchymal cells in vivo and in vitro [i.e., fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2)]. We show the presence in RIMM-18 cells of specific protein markers and functionally active signaling pathways required for induction of tubule formation in MM. Furthermore, induced RIMM-18 cells change morphology, acquiring epithelial-like features, and begin to express epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin, cytokeratin, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, and secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2). CONCLUSION: This preliminary characterization of the RIMM-18 cell line suggests that it will be useful in the study of biochemical and molecular mechanisms of nephronic development and, possibly, of some types of renal cancer such as Wilms' tumor, which caricatures the normal process of kidney development.","['Levashova, Zoia B', 'Plisov, Sergei Y', 'Perantoni, Alan O']","['Levashova ZB', 'Plisov SY', 'Perantoni AO']","['Laboratory of Comparative Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. levashovaz@ncifcfr.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (SMAD4 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Smad4 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed/*cytology/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*cytology/embryology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Mesoderm/*cytology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad4 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)49124-0 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00010.x [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 2003 Jun;63(6):2075-87. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00010.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major pathophysiological significance of L-asparaginase activity is in its clinical use for the treatment of acute lymphatic leukaemia and neoplasias that require asparagine and obtain it from circulating pools. Here we report the identification and characterization of Gliap, a cytosolic L-asparaginase, which is the founding member of a new group of L-asparaginases in mammalia. Structural modelling suggests that Gliap is an atypical mammalian type-I asparaginase inasmuch as it harbours the active centre of a type-I glycosylasparaginase but, like plant-type asparaginases, lacks their auto-proteolytic site and, in addition, exhibits significant type-II L-asparaginase enzymatic activity. Moreover, in contrast to glycosylasparaginases Gliap is enriched in the cytosolic fraction and not in lysosomes. The protein is particularly abundant in liver, testis and brain. In brain Gliap is exclusively expressed in astrocytes and prominently present in structures reminiscent of glial endfeet. These data suggest that Gliap is involved in astroglial production of the neuroactive amino acid L-aspartate.","['Dieterich, Daniela C', 'Landwehr, Marco', 'Reissner, Carsten', 'Smalla, Karl-Heinz', 'Richter, Karin', 'Wolf, Gerald', 'Bockers, Tobias M', 'Gundelfinger, Eckart D', 'Kreutz, Michael R']","['Dieterich DC', 'Landwehr M', 'Reissner C', 'Smalla KH', 'Richter K', 'Wolf G', 'Bockers TM', 'Gundelfinger ED', 'Kreutz MR']","['AG Molecular Mechanisms of Plasticity, Department of Neurochemistry and Molecular Biology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Astrocytes/*enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/cytology/*enzymology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['1766 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01766.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2003 Jun;85(5):1117-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01766.x.,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AJ427914'],,,,,,,,

We have used a colony replating assay to follow the fates of individual haemopoietic progenitor cell clones. For this, human myeloid colony-forming cells (CFCs) were cultured by standard methodology. Onset of proliferation and growth rates were established by a video recording method. Individual colonies were replated several times to document the rate of clonal extinction, and the numbers of secondary, tertiary and quaternary CFCs. The clonogenic population exhibited similar kinetics in terms of onset of proliferation and growth rate. Clonal extinction was progressive so that only 30 +/- 7% (mean +/- standard error of the mean; n = 4) of the original primary colonies formed quaternary colonies after the third replating step. However, individual primary CFCs that produced colonies throughout the experiment generated, on average, 40 +/- 8 secondary and tertiary CFCs overall. The values obtained in standard culture conditions were modified when granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or G-CSF plus interleukin 3 were used to stimulate colony growth, showing that the kinetics of colony formation respond to extrinsic regulation. Examination of the replating potential of individual secondary colonies in the clones demonstrated that they generated different numbers of tertiary colonies.

The patient group comprised 237 children < 15 years of age with de novo AML, 42 children < 15 years with Down syndrome (DS) and de novo AML, 18 adolescents 15-18 years of age with de novo AML, and 21 children < 15 years with treatment-related AML (t-AML). The first group was all-inclusive, yielding an annual childhood de novo AML incidence of 0.7/100 000. Cytogenetic analyses were successful in 288 cases (91%), and clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 211 (73%). The distribution of ploidy levels were pseudodiploidy (55%), hyperdiploidy (34%) and hypodiploidy (11%). The most common aberrations (> 2%) were + 8 (23%) (as a sole change in 6.2%), 11q23-translocations, including cryptic MLL rearrangements (22%) [t(9;11)(p21-22;q23) in 11%], t(8;21)(q22;q22) (9.0%), inv(16)(p13q22) (6.2%), -7/7q- (5.2%), and t(15;17)(q22;q12) (3.8%). Except for +8, these abnormalities were rare in group 2; only one DS patient had a t(8;21) and none had 11q23-translocations, t(15;17) or inv(16). In the t-AML group, three cases displayed 11q23-rearrangements, all t(9;11); and there were no t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16). Overall, the observed frequencies of t(8;21) and t(15;17) were lower, and frequencies of trisomy 8 and 11q23-translocations higher, than in previous studies. Furthermore, seven abnormalities that were previously reported as only single AML cases were also seen, meaning that der(4)t(4;11)(q26-27;q23), der(6)t(1;6)(q24-25;q27), der(7)t(7;11)(p22;q13), inv(8)(p23q11-12), t(11;17)(p15;q21), der(16)t(10;16)(q22;p13) and der(22)t(1;22)(q21;q13) are now classified as recurrent abnormalities in AML.

We evaluated the cancer risks associated with protracted exposure to external whole-body gamma radiation at high cumulative doses (the average dose is 0.8 Gy and the highest doses exceed 10 Gy) in Russian nuclear workers. Cancer deaths in a cohort of about 21,500 nuclear workers who began working at the Mayak complex between 1948 and 1972 were ascertained from death certificates and autopsy reports with follow-up through December 1997. Excess relative risk models were used to estimate solid cancer and leukemia risks associated with external gamma-radiation dose with adjustment for effects of plutonium exposures. Both solid cancer and leukemia death rates increased significantly with increasing gamma-ray dose (P < 0.001). Under a linear dose-response model, the excess relative risk for lung, liver and skeletal cancers as a group (668 deaths) adjusted for plutonium exposure is 0.30 per gray (P < 0.001) and 0.08 per gray (P < 0.001) for all other solid cancers (1062 deaths). The solid cancer dose-response functions appear to be nonlinear, with the excess risk estimates at doses of less than 3 Gy being about twice those predicted by the linear model. Plutonium exposure was associated with increased risks both for lung, liver and skeletal cancers (the sites of primary plutonium deposition) and for other solid cancers as a group. A significant dose response, with no indication of plutonium exposure effects, was found for leukemia. Excess risks for leukemia exhibited a significant dependence on the time since the dose was received. For doses received within 3 to 5 years of death the excess relative risk per gray was estimated to be about 7 (P < 0.001), but this risk was only 0.45 (P = 0.02) for doses received 5 to 45 years prior to death. External gamma-ray exposures significantly increased risks of both solid cancers and leukemia in this large cohort of men and women with occupational radiation exposures. Risks at doses of less than 1 Gy may be slightly lower than those seen for doses arising from acute exposures in the atomic bomb survivors. As dose estimates for the Mayak workers are improved, it should be possible to obtain more precise estimates of solid cancer and leukemia risks from protracted external radiation exposure in this cohort.","['Shilnikova, N S', 'Preston, D L', 'Ron, E', 'Gilbert, E S', 'Vassilenko, E K', 'Romanov, S A', 'Kuznetsova, I S', 'Sokolnikov, M E', 'Okatenko, P V', 'Kreslov, V V', 'Koshurnikova, N A']","['Shilnikova NS', 'Preston DL', 'Ron E', 'Gilbert ES', 'Vassilenko EK', 'Romanov SA', 'Kuznetsova IS', 'Sokolnikov ME', 'Okatenko PV', 'Kreslov VV', 'Koshurnikova NA']","['Southern Urals Biophysics Institute, Ozyorsk, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Power Plants', 'Russia']",,2003/05/20 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/05/20 05:00'],"['2003/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0787:cmrawa]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2003 Jun;159(6):787-98. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0787:cmrawa]2.0.co;2.,,,"['N01-CP-51025/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-81034/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated a saccular aneurysm of the left subclavian artery, which was considered to be a mycotic aneurysm caused by erosive fungal infection from the lung. The pseudoaneurysm was treated with a homemade stent-graft consisting of a nitinol stent and a polyester fabric. A type II endoleak present at the end of the procedure appeared to have sealed spontaneously on the CT scan at 3 days. No neurological deficit or ischemic symptoms of the left arm were noted during the follow-up, which lasted until the patient died 11 months later after rejecting a second bone marrow transplant.

While not conclusive, these studies raise questions about the effects of chemical exposures on the lymphocytic versus myeloid cell lines. Almost 70 occupational cohort studies were identified that addressed B-cell cancer risks in 9 major industrial categories, in order to look for common patterns across industries. This effort was substantially limited by the inconsistent nature of lymphohematopoietic (LH) classification schemes across studies and over time, and the relative paucity of B-cell-specific results in studies for any given industry. Taking these limitations into consideration, a descriptive, graphical analysis suggested a pattern of B-cell cancer elevations in the rubber and ""general chemical"" industries, but no consistent patterns in petroleum production/distribution or petrochemical production. The limited data sources, which lack detail about differences in hazard and exposure for different types of products/chemicals, did not allow a comprehensive look at possible common exposures associated with B-cell cancer elevations across industries. This study suggests that evaluation of possible associations between specific chemical exposures and B-cell malignancies would require additional studies with clear and common definitions of B-cell outcomes. The article concludes by giving an example of a possible common framework for categorizing NHL, the diseases for which most classification issues arise.","['Bukowski, John A', 'Huebner, Wendy W', 'Schnatter, A Robert', 'Wojcik, Nancy C']","['Bukowski JA', 'Huebner WW', 'Schnatter AR', 'Wojcik NC']","['ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc., Annandale, New Jersey, USA. john.a.bukowski@exxonmobil.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Here, we describe an interesting case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production. A 47-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a 7-month history of hyperpigmentation. The plasma level of ACTH was markedly elevated without a circadian rhythm and the level of cortisol was normal. Examination of bone marrow aspiration revealed ALL, and no other disease as a cause of the elevated ACTH was detected. Sephadex G-75 chromatography of plasma ACTH extract revealed the existence of an abnormally large molecular ACTH (probably proopiomelanocortin) in addition to authentic 1-39 ACTH. Ectopic ACTH of low biological activity is considered to be the reason for a discrepancy in the plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol. Shortly after remission induction chemotherapy, blast cells in the peripheral blood disappeared, and the plasma level of ACTH became normal, leading to an improvement of skin pigmentation. These clinical findings and laboratory data suggested that leukemia cells in this case may produce the ACTH.","['Makita, M', 'Maeda, Y', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Nakase, K', 'Takenaka, K', 'Shinagawa, K', 'Ishimaru, F', 'Ikeda, K', 'Niiya, K', 'Ogura, T', 'Harada, M']","['Makita M', 'Maeda Y', 'Hashimoto K', 'Nakase K', 'Takenaka K', 'Shinagawa K', 'Ishimaru F', 'Ikeda K', 'Niiya K', 'Ogura T', 'Harada M']","['Department of Biopathology Science, Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama University Graduate Schools, 2-5-1 Shikatacho, 700-8558 Okayama, Japan. makita@d5.dion.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Hyperpigmentation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2002/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0671-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2003 Jul;82(7):448-51. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0671-8.

METHODS: Cell growth was measured using an MTT assay. Cell viability was determined using a dye exclusion test. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured using a glutathione assay kit. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was assessed by rhodamine 123 (Rh123) staining intensity on flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activity was evaluated using a commercially available assay kit on flow cytometry. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was estimated in terms of caspase(+)/PI(-) cells on flow cytometry after assessment for activation of caspase-3 by adding PI. RESULTS: MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4/DNR cells were similarly sensitive to the apoptosis-inducing effect of As(2)O(3). Buthionine sulfoxide (BSO) and ascorbic acid (AA) rendered these cells more sensitive to As(2)O(3), whereas N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced this sensitivity. BSO and AA decreased, but NAC increased, the intracellular GSH contents of both MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells. Decreasing GSH with BSO potentiated As(2)O(3)-mediated growth inhibition, disruption of MMP, activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis of cells. Clinically relevant doses of AA enhanced the anticancer effects of As(2)O(3) via the disruption of MMP, activation of caspase-3, and induction of apoptosis. In contrast, increase GSH levels with NAC attenuated all of these As(2)O(3)-mediated actions. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells to As(2)O(3) was associated with the intracellular GSH content. As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis in parent MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4/DNR cells expressing functional P-gp via depletion of intracellular GSH, and subsequent disruption of MMP and activation of caspase-3.","['Hu, Xiao-Mei', 'Hirano, Toshihiko', 'Oka, Kitaro']","['Hu XM', 'Hirano T', 'Oka K']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, 192-0392 Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/08/27 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2002/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0629-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Jul;52(1):47-58. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0629-5.

The intracellular incubation period is modeled by a gamma distribution and the model is a system of two differential equations with distributed delay, which includes the differential equations model with a discrete delay and the ordinary differential equations model as special cases. We study the stability in all three types of models. It is shown that the ODE model is globally stable while both delay models exhibit Hopf bifurcations by using the (average) delay as a bifurcation parameter. The results indicate that, differing from the cell-to-free virus spread models, the cell-to-cell spread models can produce infective oscillations in typical tissue culture parameter regimes and the latently infected cells are instrumental in sustaining the infection.

Solutions of propyl gallate turn dark in the presence of iron or iron salts. Propyl gallate has been used since 1948 as an antioxidant to stabilize cosmetics, food packaging materials, and foods containing fats. As an additive, it may be found in edible fats, oils, mayonnaise, shortening, baked goods, candy, dried meat, fresh pork sausage, and dried milk, and it is used in hair grooming products, pressure-sensitive adhesives, lubricating oil additives, and transforming oils. A NTP Carcinogenesis bioassay of propyl gallate was conducted by feeding diets containing 6,000 or 12,000 ppm propyl gallate to groups of 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 untreated rats and 50 untreated mice of each sex served as controls. Survival of rats and mice was not adversely affected by propyl gallate, but mean body weights of dosed rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of the controls. At 104 weeks, mean body weights of low-and high-dose rats were 4% and 8% lower than those of the controls for males and 11% and 19% lower than those of the controls for females. Similarly, mean body weights of low-and high-dose mice were 5% and 8% lower than those of the controls for males and 11% (both dose groups) lower than those of the controls for females. Thyroid follicular-cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) occurred in male rats with a statistically significant (P<0.05) positive trend, but the incidences in the dosed groups were not statistically significant in direct comparisons with the control groups. Moreover, the incidence of high-dose male rats with follicular-cell tumors (3/50, 6%) was not statistically different from the historical control rate (14/584, 2.4%) for the laboratory that conducted this bioassay. Rare tumors (an astrocytoma or a glioma) were found in the brains of two low-dose female rats. The incidence of all brain tumors in the Bioassay Program is only 0.86%. The absence of this tumor in the high-dose female rat group reduces the likelihood that this tumor is related to propyl gallate administration. Increased incidences of hepatic cytoplasmic vacuolization and suppurative inflammation of the prostate were observed in dosed male rats. These findings were considered to be related to administration of propyl gallate. Tumors (mostly benign) of the preputial gland, islet-cell tumors of the pancreas, and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland were observed with significantly (P<0.05) higher incidences in the low- dose male rats, but there was little evidence of an effect in the high-dose group. The incidences of male rats with tumors of the preputial gland were 1/50 (2%) for controls, 8/50 (16%) for the low-dose, and 0/50 (0%) for the high-dose group. Islet-cell tumors of the pancreas occurred in 2/50 (4%) control males, 9/50 (18%) low-dose males, and 4/50 (8%) for high-dose males. Pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland were observed in 4/50 (8%) control males, 13/48 (25%) low-dose males, and 8/50 (16%) high-dose males. Negative trends (P<0.05) were observed for leukemia in male rats (16/50, 7/50, 6/50) and for fibroadenomas of the mammary gland in female rats (11/50, 2/50, 5/50). In male mice, malignant lymphoma was observed with a significantly (P</=0.014) positive trend (control, 1/50, 2%; low-dose, 3/49, 6%; high-dose, 8/50, 16%), and the incidence in the high-dose group was significantly (P</=0.028) higher than that observed in the concurrent controls. However, the high-dose incidence was not statistically different from the historical rate (60/640, 9.4%) for the laboratory that conducted this bioassay. Adenomas of the liver in female mice occurred with a statistically significant (P</=0.022) positive trend, and the incidence in the high-dose group was significantly (P</=0.039) higher than that of the controls (0/50, 0%; 2/50, 4%; 5/49, 10%).

The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were similar in control and dosed groups (3/50, 6&percnt;; 3/50, 6&percnt;; 5/49, 10&percnt;). Negative trends (P&lt;0.05) were obtained for fibromas of the skin or subcutaneous tissue in male mice (5/50, 1/49, 0/50). Under the conditions of this bioassay, propyl gallate was not considered carcinogenic for F344/N rats, although there was evidence of an increased proportion of low-dose male rats with preputial gland tumors, islet-cell tumors of the pancreas, and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal glands; rare tumors of the brain occurred in two low-dose females. Propyl gallate was not considered to be carcinogenic for B6C3F1 mice of either sex, although the increased incidence of malignant lymphoma in male mice may have been related to the dietary administration of propyl gallate.

Diallyl phthalate or diallyl phthalate polyester blends are used primarily as plasticizers and carriers for adding catalysts and pigments to polyesters and in molding, electrical parts, laminating compounds, and impregnation of metal castings. Rubber compounds, epoxy formulations, and polyurethane foams may also contain diallyl phthalate. Annual production of diallyl phthalate in the United States exceeds 5,000 pounds; precise figures are not available. A NTP Carcinogenesis bioassay of diallyl phthalate (99% pure) was conducted by administering 0 (vehicle control), 150, or 300 mg/kg diallyl phthalate in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice. Survival rates and mean body weights of dosed mice were not different from those of the controls, and pathological lesions unrelated to proliferative changes were not observed. Therefore, a maximally tolerated dose for the purposes of carcinogenicity testing may not have been achieved. The incidences of lymphoma and either lymphoma or leukemia in dosed male mice were no significantly greater than those in the controls according to pairwise comparisons (P=0.051 to P=0.096), but the trend tests were statistically significant by either life table or incidental tumor analysis (P=0.031 to P=0.045). The incidence of lymphomas in the high-dose male mice was 12/50 (24%) in comparison with 6/50 (12%) in the controls. Recent historical incidences at the performing laboratory and in the NTP Bioassay Program were 18/120 (15%) and 71/661 (11%), respectively. Since the incidence of high-dose male mice with leukemia was not significantly greater than that of concurrent or historical controls at the performing laboratory by pairwise comparisons, this marginal increase was considered only to be equivocally related to diallyl phthalate administration. Increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas, hyperplasia, and inflammatory lesions of the forestomach were observed in diallyl phthalate-dosed mice of both sexes in a dose-related manner. Papillomas of the forestomach were observed in 0%, 2%, and 4% of the control, low-dose, and high-dose mice of both sexes. The recent historical incidence of this tumor in gavage control mice from both the performing laboratory and other laboratories within the Bioassay Program was less than 1%. Forestomach hyperplasia was diagnosed in 0%, 15%, and 18%, and in 8%, 2%, and 29% of the control, low-dose, and high-dose male and female mice, respectively; chronic inflammation of the forestomach was diagnosed in 0%, 9%, and 16% and in 4%, 2%, and 18% of the control, low-dose, and high-dose male and female mice, respectively. Because of the numerical elevation of the forestomach papillomas in the high-dose mice of both sexes, the concomitant observation of dose related forestomach hyperplasia, and the rarity of this tumor in corn oil (gavage) control B6C3F1 mice, the development of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach may have been related to diallyl phthalate administration. Under the conditions of this bioassay, the development of chronic inflammation and hyperplasia of the forestomach in both male and female B6C3F1 mice was considered to be related to the administration of diallyl phthalate. The development of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach may also have been related to chemical administration, but the available data are insufficient to indicate a clear cause and effect relationship. An increase in the incidence of male mice with lymphomas was observed, but this increase was considered only to be equivocally related to diallyl phthalate administration. The results of this bioassay, therefore, do not indicate that diallyl phthalate is carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, although a maximum tolerated dose may not have been achieved. A carcinogenicity study by the National Toxicology Program of diallyl phthalate in male and female Fisher 344/N rats, employing daily gavage doses of 0 (vehicle control), 50, or 100 mg/kg boicology Program of diallyl phthalate in male and female Fisher 344/N rats, employing daily gavage doses of 0 (vehicle control), 50, or 100 mg/kg body weight is currently being evaluated.

These chemicals are used extensively in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foams for thermal insulation and in the production of semiflexible polyurethane foams for automobile safety cushioning. The saturated isocyante of 4,4'-methylenedianiline [4,4'-methylene-bis(cyclohexylisocyanate)] is an intermediate in the production of light-stable, high-performance polyurethane coatings. 4,4'-Methylenedianiline is also a curing agent for epoxy resins and urethane elastomers, a dye intermediate, and a corrosion inhibitor. NTP Carcinogenesis studies of 4,4'-methylenedianiline dihydrochloride (98.6% pure) were conducted by administering this chemical in the drinking water of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex received drinking water containing 150 or 300 ppm 4,4'-methylenedianiline dihydrochloride (dosage expressed as the free base) for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex, given drinking water adjusted with 0.1N HCl to the pH (3.7) of the 300-ppm formulation, served as controls. Survival was comparable among groups except for male mice receiving the high dose of 4,4'-methylenedianiline dihydrochloride; survival in that group was lower (P=0.006) than that in controls. Mean body weight was reduced in high dose female rats and in high dose male and female mice. Water consumption was reduced in a dose-related manner in both sexes of rats. No compound-related clinical effects were observed. Compound-related nonneoplastic lesions of the thyroid in female rats included follicular cysts and hyperplasia. The incidence of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia was elevated in high dose male and female mice. The incidences of thyroid neoplasms in the high dose groups were elevated compared with those of the control groups for both sexes of both species. Thyroid follicular cell carcinoma was increased in male rats (controls, 0/49; low dose, 0/47; high dose, 7/48, 15%: P</=0.012). Follicular cell adenoma was increased in high dose female rats (0/47; 2/47, 4%; 17/48, 35%: P<0.001), in high dose male mice (0/47; 3/49, 6%; 16/49, 33%: P<0.001), and in high dose female mice (0/50; 1/47, 2%; 13/50, 26%: P<0.001) as compared with controls. In female rats, thyroid C-cell adenoma was also elevated in a dose-related manner (0/47; 3/47, 6%; 6/48, 13%, P</=0.029). Dose-related increases in nonneoplastic lesions were observed for male rats (nonspecific liver dilatation) and for male and female rats (fatty metamorphosis and focal cellular change). Liver degeneration was present in 80% of the low dose and 60% of the high dose male mice but was not found in the controls. Neoplastic nodules of the liver were observed at greater incidences (P</=0.002) for low and high dose male rats as compared with controls (control, 1/50, 2%; low dose, 12/50, 24%, P</=0.002; high dose 25/50, 50%, P<0.001). Hepatocellular adenoma was increased in a dose-related manner in dosed female mice (3/50, 6%; 9/50, 18%; 12/50, 24%, P<0.011). Hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in greater incidence in dosed male mice (10/49, 20%; 33/50, 66%, P<0.001; 29/50, 58%, P<0.001) and in high dose female mice (1/50, 2%; 6/50, 12%; 11/50, 22%, P=0.002). Male rats had a dose related increase in kidney mineralization. Nephropathy was increased in dosed mice of both sexes; renal papillary mineralization was greater in high dose male mice and female mice than in the controls. Other tumors that were elevated in dosed animals included adrenal pheochromocytomas in male mice (control, 2/48, 4%; low dose, 12/49, 24%, P</=0.006; high dose, 14/49, 29%; P</=0.001), alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma in female mice (1/50, 2%; 2/50, 4%; 6/49, 12%, P</=0.05) and malignant lymphomas in female mice (13/50,26%; 28/50, 56%, P=0.002; 29/50, 58%; P=0.001). Uncommon tumors were observed in dosed animals at low incidences but may be important because the historical control incidences are very low; bile duct adenoma in 1/50 high dose male (13/50,26&percnt;; 28/50, 56&percnt;, P=0.002; 29/50, 58&percnt;; P=0.001). Uncommon tumors were observed in dosed animals at low incidences but may be important because the historical control incidences are very low; bile duct adenoma in 1/50 high dose male rats (historical control 3/3,663), transitional-cell papillomas of the urinary bladder in female rats (historical control, 3/3,664, 0.08&percnt;; low dose, 2/50, 4&percnt;; high dose, 1/50, 2&percnt;) and granulosa cell tumors of the ovary in female rats (historical control, 11/3,642, 0.3&percnt;; low dose, 3/50, 6&percnt;; high dose, 2/50, 4&percnt;).

We analyzed by immunohistochemistry the relation between glutathione s-transferase pi (GST-pi) expression in tumor cells and outcome in 69 cases of diffuse large B-cell NHL (DLBCL). GST-pi expression was considered as low when <50% of tumor cells were stained and high when >/=50% tumor cells were stained. Median follow-up was 58 months. GST-pi expression was correlated with the probability of achieving complete remission (CR). Patients with high GST-pi expression had a worse 5-year freedom from progression (FFP). High GST-pi expression was associated with a trend for lower survival. In the group of patients with International Prognostic Index (IPI) 0-1, low GST-pi expression was associated with a CR rate of 88%, a 5-year FFP of 76+/-20% and a 5-year survival of 78+/-16% compared to 36, 14+/-16 and 40+/-32%, respectively, in patients with a high GST-pi expression (P=0.002, P&<10(-5) and P=0.01, respectively). No correlation was found between GST-pi expression and lactico deshydrogenase serum level, age, Ann Arbor stage, performance status, and IPI index. Both GST-pi expression and the IPI index correlated with FFP. After incorporating IPI and GST-pi expression in a multivariate analysis for FFP, GST-p expression remained the only prognostic factor (P=0.003). Our findings suggest that GST-pi expression had strong prognostic significance in DLBCL, which appears to be independent of other prognostic parameters in those disorders.","['Ribrag, V', 'Koscielny, S', 'Carpiuc, I', 'Cebotaru, C', 'Vande Walle, H', 'Talbot, M', 'Fenaux, P', 'Bosq, J']","['Ribrag V', 'Koscielny S', 'Carpiuc I', 'Cebotaru C', 'Vande Walle H', 'Talbot M', 'Fenaux P', 'Bosq J']","['1Departement de Medecine, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402930 [doi]', '2402930 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):972-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402930.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative splicing of the WT1 mRNA yields several protein isoforms with distinct DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activities. In this study, we investigated the effect of the WT1 isoform lacking two alternatively spliced sequences (WT1 (-/-)) in 32D cl3 cells, a murine myeloid progenitor cell line.

WT1 (-/-) inhibited G1/S progression in G-CSF but not in interleukin-3, potentially accounting for its ability to accelerate differentiation.

Although the response of APL cells to As(2)O(3) has been linked to degradation of the PML/RARalpha fusion oncoprotein, there is evidence that PML/RARalpha expression is not the only mediator of arsenic sensitivity. Indeed, we found that exogenous expression of PML/RARalpha did not sensitize a non-APL leukemic line to As(2)O(3). To evaluate possible other determinants of sensitivity of leukemic cells to As(2)O(3), we derived two arsenic-resistant NB4 subclones. Despite being approximately 10-fold more resistant to arsenic than their parental cell line, PML/RARalpha protein was still degraded by As(2)O(3) in these cells, providing further evidence that loss of expression of the oncoprotein does not confer arsenic sensitivity. Both arsenic-resistant clones contained high glutathione (GSH) levels, however, and we found that GSH depletion coupled with As(2)O(3) treatment dramatically inhibited their growth. Annexin V-staining and TUNEL analysis confirmed a synergistic induction of apoptosis. In addition, these cells failed to accumulate ROS in response to arsenic treatment, in contrast to their arsenic-sensitive parental cells, unless cotreated with buthionine sulfoximine. While other malignant cells did not show a good correlation between arsenic sensitivity and GSH content, GSH depletion nevertheless sensitized all cell lines examined, regardless of their initial response to arsenic alone. These findings suggest that PML/RARalpha expression is not a determinant of arsenic sensitivity, and further support the coupling of GSH depletion and arsenic treatment as a novel treatment for human malignancies that are unresponsive to arsenic alone.","['Davison, K', 'Cote, S', 'Mader, S', 'Miller, W H']","['Davison K', 'Cote S', 'Mader S', 'Miller WH']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B Davis Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Glutathione/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402876 [doi]', '2402876 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):931-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402876.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a unique AML subset requiring tailored therapy including all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. We analysed in this study the incidence and type of infections complicating the clinical course of 89 consecutive APL patients receiving the AIDA protocol at a single institution. A total of 179 febrile episodes were registered during induction and consolidation, 52% of which were of unknown origin. Infections were clinically and microbiologically documented in 10.6 and 37.4% of cases, respectively. Coagulase-negative staphylococci represented the major cause of septicaemia (28%) and were more frequently isolated during induction, whereas viridans group streptococci, the second pathogen most frequently isolated from blood (27%), represented the principal pathogen detected during consolidation and were significantly associated with mucositis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 33.3% of all blood isolates. Fungal infections were only occasionally observed. Bloodstream infections in APL patients were compared with those documented in 271 consecutive patients affected by other subtypes of AML. The incidence of total septicaemia episodes, of staphylococcal bacteraemias and of fungaemias was significantly higher in patients with other AMLs. Empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone plus amikacin was effective in 73% of APL cases, most of the remaining cases being successfully managed by the addition of teicoplanin. One single death apparently related to infectious complication was recorded. Overall, infections led to antileukaemic treatment withdrawal in six patients, five of whom currently remain in haematologic remission for 13-106 months. These results indicate that a particular pattern of infections is observed in APL patients receiving ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy and that these appear to be effectively counteracted by standard management.","['Girmenia, C', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Breccia, M', 'Latagliata, R', 'Spadea, A', ""D'Andrea, M"", 'Gentile, G', 'Micozzi, A', 'Alimena, G', 'Martino, P', 'Mandelli, F']","['Girmenia C', 'Lo Coco F', 'Breccia M', 'Latagliata R', 'Spadea A', ""D'Andrea M"", 'Gentile G', 'Micozzi A', 'Alimena G', 'Martino P', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'AIDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amikacin/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Ceftazidime/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/microbiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Streptococcal Infections/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402899 [doi]', '2402899 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):925-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402899.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional analysis of bscCD19 x CD3 has so far been exclusively performed with human B lymphoma cell lines and T cells from healthy donors. Here we analysed the properties of bscCD19 x CD3 using primary B cells and autologous T cells from healthy volunteers or patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). We show that bscCD19 x CD3 induces T-cell-mediated depletion of nonmalignant B cells in all four cases and depletion of primary lymphoma cells in 22 out of 25 cases. This effect could be observed at low effector-to-target (E:T) ratios and in the majority of cases without additional activation of autologous T cells by IL-2. Even in samples derived from patients heavily pretreated with different chemotherapy regimens, strong cytotoxic effects of bscCD19 x CD3 could be observed. The addition of bscCD19 x CD3 to patients' cells resulted in an upregulation of activation-specific cell surface antigens on autologous T cells and elevated levels of CD95 on lymphoma B cells. Although anti-CD95 antibody CH-11 failed to induce apoptosis in lymphoma cells, we provide evidence that B-CLL cell depletion by bscCD3 x CD3 is mediated at least in part by apoptosis via the caspase pathway.","['Loffler, A', 'Gruen, M', 'Wuchter, C', 'Schriever, F', 'Kufer, P', 'Dreier, T', 'Hanakam, F', 'Baeuerle, P A', 'Bommert, K', 'Karawajew, L', 'Dorken, B', 'Bargou, R C']","['Loffler A', 'Gruen M', 'Wuchter C', 'Schriever F', 'Kufer P', 'Dreier T', 'Hanakam F', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Bommert K', 'Karawajew L', 'Dorken B', 'Bargou RC']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Tumourimmunology, Robert Rossle Clinic, Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402890 [doi]', '2402890 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):900-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402890.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, DC fused with tumour cells may be effective for immune response induction. Both cell preparations may be considered as vaccine candidates in a therapeutic approach. We examined autologous T-cell activation by DC that had endocytosed leukaemic B-cell apoptotic bodies (Apo-DC) and compared it to the T-cell stimulatory capacity of DC that were fused with tumour cells. Following incubation, 22.6+/-6.2 (mean+/-s.e.m.) of DC had endocytosed leukaemic cells, while the frequency of DC-leukaemic cell hybrids was 10.5+/-2.6%. Apo-DC and hybrid cells both demonstrated the ability to stimulate a tumour-specific T-cell immune response in vitro. A T-cell proliferation response was also observed in four out of five CLL patients when using Apo-DC. However, fusion hybrids lacked the ability to elicit a proliferative response. Apo-DC also induced an IFN-gamma response, as did hybrid cells. The cytokine response induced by Apo-DC was significantly higher than that induced by fusion (P<0.05). This study shows that endocytosed apoptotic tumour cells induced a significantly stronger T-cell response than DC hybrids; and as such should be a better candidate for vaccine production.","['Kokhaei, P', 'Rezvany, M R', 'Virving, L', 'Choudhury, A', 'Rabbani, H', 'Osterborg, A', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Kokhaei P', 'Rezvany MR', 'Virving L', 'Choudhury A', 'Rabbani H', 'Osterborg A', 'Mellstedt H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, CCK, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chimera', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Endocytosis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402913 [doi]', '2402913 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):894-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402913.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In paediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) chromosomal translocations are present in 30-35% of cases. HOX11 and the closely related HOX11L2 genes play a key role in T-ALL. HOX11 is aberrantly activated by either of the two chromosomal translocations, t(7;10) and t(10;14). In this study, HOX11 expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We show that leukaemic blasts from 15/76 (19.7%) paediatric T-ALL patients expressed the HOX11 gene at high level and 22/76 (28.9%) at low level, yet the reported frequency for chromosomal rearrangement of 10q24 is 4-7%. Direct cytogenetic analysis revealed that only 2/16 specimens that showed HOX11 expression exhibited abnor-malities at 10q24. These results confirm and extend our previously published findings, and implicate mechanisms other than gross chromosomal translocations for the deregulation of HOX11. Analysis of clinical outcome for the whole study group showed a trend for better outcome for patients with leukaemic blasts expressing HOX11 at high level. A statistically significant difference in clinical outcome was found in a subgroup of 20 patients treated for high-risk disease on CCG-1901 from the Children's Cancer Group, where HOX11 expression in leukaemic blasts conferred a prognostic advantage (P=0.01).","['Kees, U R', 'Heerema, N A', 'Kumar, R', 'Watt, P M', 'Baker, D L', 'La, M K', 'Uckun, F M', 'Sather, H N']","['Kees UR', 'Heerema NA', 'Kumar R', 'Watt PM', 'Baker DL', 'La MK', 'Uckun FM', 'Sather HN']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ploidies', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402892 [doi]', '2402892 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):887-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402892.,,,"['CA83088/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA79726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain-coding sequence of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) is found in 20-25% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and at a lower frequency in childhood AML. FLT3-ITD is associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis, especially in patients with normal karyotype. Recently, there have been three reports on point mutations at codon 835 of the FLT3 gene (D835 mutations) in adult AML. These mutations are located in the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FLT3 (FLT3-TKD). The clinical and prognostic relevance of the TKD mutations is less clear. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report to describe FLT3-TKD mutations in childhood AML. In this pediatric series, FLT3-TKD mutations occurred in three of 91 patients (3.3%), an incidence significantly lower than that of FLT3-ITD (14 of 91 patients, 15.4%) in the same cohort of patients. None of them had both FLT3-TKD and FLT3-ITD mutations. Sequence analysis showed one each of D835 Y, D835 V, and D835 H. Of the three patients carrying FLT3-TKD, two had AML-M3 with one each of L- and V-type PML-RARalpha, and another one had AML-M2 with AML1-ETO.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using an MLL probe that was performed to elucidate the discrepancy disclosed the presence of normal dividing cells and nondividing leukemic cells in the same bone marrow in five patients, and cryptic insertion or translocation in another five. Subsequent FISH and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis identified the MLL-AF10, MLL-AF4, or MLL-AF1q fusions that were produced by the cryptic rearrangements in four of the five patients. In the remaining three patients, the breakpoint of 11q23 translocation was located distal to the MLL locus in one, and the discrepancy was unresolved in two.

PBSCT can be associated with a higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). In this study, we investigated whether there was a correlation between the composition of PBSC grafts (CD34+ and CD3+ cells) and hematological recovery, GVHD, relapse, and relapse-free survival (RFS) after myeloablative HLA-identical sibling PBSCT. The evolution of 100 acute or chronic leukemia patients was analyzed. Neither hematological recovery, acute or cGVHD, nor relapse, was significantly associated with CD3+ cell dose. Increasing CD34+ stem cells was associated with faster neutrophil (P=0.03) and platelet (P=0.007) recovery. Moreover, 47 of the 78 patients evaluable for cGVHD (60%; 95% CI, 49-71%) developed extensive cGVHD. The probability of extensive cGVHD at 4 years was 34% (95% CI, 21-47%) in patients receiving a 'low' CD34+ cell dose (<8.3 x 10(6)/kg), as compared to 62% (95% CI, 48-76%) in patients receiving a 'high' CD34+ cell dose (>8.3 x 10(6)/kg) (P=0.01). At a median follow-up of 59 months, this has not translated into a difference in relapse. In patients evaluable for cGVHD, RFS was significantly higher in patients receiving a 'low' CD34+ cell dose as compared to those receiving a 'high' CD34+ cell dose (P=0.04). This difference was mainly because of a significantly higher cGVHD-associated mortality (P=0.01). Efforts to accelerate engraftment by increasing CD34+ cell dose must be counterbalanced with the risk of detrimental cGVHD.","['Mohty, M', 'Bilger, K', 'Jourdan, E', 'Kuentz, M', 'Michallet, M', 'Bourhis, J H', 'Milpied, N', 'Sutton, L', 'Jouet, J P', 'Attal, M', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Sadoun, A', 'Ifrah, N', 'Guyotat, D', 'Faucher, C', 'Fegueux, N', 'Reiffers, J', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Blaise, D']","['Mohty M', 'Bilger K', 'Jourdan E', 'Kuentz M', 'Michallet M', 'Bourhis JH', 'Milpied N', 'Sutton L', 'Jouet JP', 'Attal M', 'Bordigoni P', 'Cahn JY', 'Sadoun A', 'Ifrah N', 'Guyotat D', 'Faucher C', 'Fegueux N', 'Reiffers J', 'Maraninchi D', 'Blaise D']","['Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/immunology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402909 [doi]', '2402909 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):869-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402909.,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1467-9.

Separate assessments for unrelated vs related donors and the use of bone marrow or mobilized G-CSF stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (G-PBMC) have been incorporated. The three primary findings are: (1) Higher CD34 dose results in better neutrophil and platelet recovery in all settings. (2) Higher CD34 doses (8 x 10(6)/kg) are associated with the development of more chronic graft-versus-host disease when using related G-PBMC. (3) Higher CD34 dose is correlated with improved survival after unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation. These data suggest that the CD34 content of a graft can have a significant impact on clinical outcome after allogeneic transplantation, but defining an optimal dose is dependent on both the type of donor and the stem cell source.","['Heimfeld, S']",['Heimfeld S'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402893 [doi]', '2402893 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):856-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402893.,,,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL66947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether R115777 might exert similar activity in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM), we evaluated its effects on circulating myeloid progenitor cells from patients with MMM (n=25) using in vitro colony-forming assays. The median R115777 concentrations that inhibited colony formation by 50% were 34 and 2.7 nM for myeloid and megakaryocytic colonies from MMM patients, respectively. Progenitors from normal controls and patients with other myeloproliferative disorders demonstrated similar sensitivity. Since the ras polypeptides are one putative target of FTIs, the potential role of ras effectors was examined by incubating parallel progenitor assays with the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 (PI-3) kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 inhibitor PD98059. MMM progenitor colonies (n=7) were highly sensitive to LY294002 but not to PD98059, implying that the PI-3 kinase pathway may be critical for survival and proliferation of these cells.

Since available clinical data obtained with this novel approach are very limited, we have performed a survey on this issue. Data of 77 patients were collected from 29 European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers. Median age was 54 (30-66) years, and the median number of previous chemotherapy regimens was 3 (0-8). HLA-identical sibling donors were used in 81% of the cases. Moderate conditioning regimens (mainly low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) or fludarabine-cyclophosphamide combinations) were administered to 56% of the patients, whereas the remainder received more intense conditioning consisting of fludarabine-busulfan or high-dose melphalan combinations. In 40% of the patients, in vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) with anti-thymocyte globulin or CAMPATH-1H was part of the conditioning regimen. Cumulative treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 18% (95% CI 9; 27) after 12 months. Complete chimerism as well as best response was not achieved immediately post-transplant but took a median of 3 months to develop. The 2-year probability of relapse was 31% (95% CI 18; 44), with no event occurring later than 12 months post transplant in the absence of TCD. With one exception, relapses were not observed after onset of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Event-free and overall survival at 24 months were 56% (95% CI 43; 69) and 72% (95% CI 61; 83), respectively. The median follow-up was 18 (1-44) months. Donor lymphocyte infusions or secondary transplants were performed in 19 patients with insufficient disease control and/or incomplete donor chimerism post-transplant, leading to a response in seven patients (37%). Preliminary multivariate analysis identified less than PR at transplant (hazard ratio (HR) 3.5; P&<0.01) and alternative donor (HR 3.1; P=0.02) as significant risk factors for relapse, whereas number of previous regimens >2 (HR 5.4; P=0.03), TBI (HR 2.5; P=0.05), and alternative donor (HR 2.3; P=0.08) were risk factors for survival.

Discovery of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein as the molecular abnormality causing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) paved the way for the development of a targeted anticancer therapy. The substantial activity of imatinib mesylate (STI571, Glivec) in CML and Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) changed the therapeutic approach to Ph+ leukemia and rang the bell for a new era of anticancer treatment. However, when the phenomenon of relapse occurred despite continued imatinib treatment, we had to learn the lesson that imatinib can select for a resistant disease clone. If such a clone still depends on Bcr-Abl, it either carries a BCR-ABL point mutation that prevents binding of the drug or expresses the fusion protein at high levels. Alternatively, leukemia cells that harbor secondary genetic alterations resulting in Bcr-Abl-independent proliferation are selected for their growth advantage in the presence of imatinib. Point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain prevent binding of imatinib but still allow binding of ATP, thus retaining Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Mutated BCR-ABL is frequently detected in cases of imatinib-resistant Ph+ leukemia and therefore represents the main challenge for the investigation of alternative strategies to either overcome resistance or to prevent the emergence of a resistant leukemic clone.","['von Bubnoff, N', 'Peschel, C', 'Duyster, J']","['von Bubnoff N', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['1Laboratory of Leukemogenesis, Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",85,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402889 [doi]', '2402889 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 May;17(5):829-38. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402889.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the optimal long-term management of patients who achieve CCR after imatinib is unknown. With longer follow-up, it is anticipated that some patients are likely to progress and become candidates for autologous transplantation. We studied filgrastim (r-metHuG-CSF) mobilisation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in 32 patients who have achieved CCR with imatinib. Our data demonstrate that (1) the target CD34(+) cell yields of >/=2.0 x 10(6)/kg were attained with filgrastim 10 microg/kg/day, in 9/18 (50%) of patients during uninterrupted imatinib therapy, and in 10/14 (70%) when imatinib was temporarily withheld.

A cell line (termed FA-AML1) was established from blast cells obtained after a second relapse after a successful bone marrow transplant. Histochemical and surface marker analysis confirmed that the cells were derived from the myeloid lineage. Cytogenetic analysis revealed multiple chromosomal aberrations, including a ring 7. Stable proliferation of the cultured cells was absolutely dependent on the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin 3. This is the first AML cell line successfully established from a FA patient. Remarkably, FA-AML1 cells appeared to lack the characteristic cellular FA phenotype, i.e., a hypersensitivity to growth inhibition and chromosomal breakage by the cross-linking agent mitomycin C. Genomic DNA from the patient showed biallelic mutations [8415G>T (K2729N)and 8732C>A (S2835STOP)] in the breast cancer susceptibility gene FANCD1/BRCA2 [N. Howlett et al., Science (Wash. DC), 297: 606-609, 2002]. In the AML cells, however, the 8732C>A nonsense mutation was changed into a missense mutation by a secondary alteration, 8731T>G, resulting in 2835E, which restored the open-reading frame of the gene and could explain the reverted phenotype of these cells. Loss of the FA phenotype by genetic correction of a FA gene mutation during AML progression may be a common late event in the pathogenesis of AML in FA patients, which may be treatment related. This finding suggests a novel mechanistic principle of tumor progression based on the genetic correction of an early caretaker gene defect.","['Ikeda, Hideyuki', 'Matsushita, Maiko', 'Waisfisz, Quinten', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Oostra, Anneke B', 'Nieuwint, Aggie W M', 'De Winter, Johan P', 'Hoatlin, Maureen E', 'Kawai, Yohko', 'Sasaki, Masao S', ""D'Andrea, Alan D"", 'Kawakami, Yutaka', 'Joenje, Hans']","['Ikeda H', 'Matsushita M', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Kinoshita A', 'Oostra AB', 'Nieuwint AW', 'De Winter JP', 'Hoatlin ME', 'Kawai Y', 'Sasaki MS', ""D'Andrea AD"", 'Kawakami Y', 'Joenje H']","['Division of Cellular Signaling, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*genetics/pathology', '*Genes, BRCA2', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 May 15;63(10):2688-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homologous recombination is implicated in the ALT pathway in both yeast and human ALT cells. In ALT cells, two types of DNA double-strand break repair and homologous recombination factors, the Rad50/Mre11/NBS1 complex and Rad51/Rad52 along with replication factors (RPA) and telomere binding proteins (TRF1 and TRF2), are associated with the ALT-associated PML body (APB). DNA synthesis in late S-G(2) is associated with APBs, which contain telomeric DNA and, are therefore, potential sites for telomere length maintenance. Here, we show that the breast cancer susceptibility gene product, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, and the human homologue of yeast Rap1, hRap1, are also associated with APBs specifically during late S-G(2) phase of the cell cycle. We additionally show that the localization of the double-strand break repair factors with APBs is distinct from their association with ionizing radiation-induced nuclear foci. To systematically explore the mechanism involved in the assembly of APBs, we examine the role of Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1) and TRF1 in this process, respectively. We demonstrated that NBS1 plays a key role in the assembly and/or recruitment of Rad50, Mre11, and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, but not Rad51 or TRF1, to APBs. The NH(2) terminus of NBS1, specifically the BRCA1 COOH-terminal domain, is required for this activity. Although TRF1 interacts with NBS1 directly, it is dispensable for the association of either Rad50/Mre11/NBS1 or Rad51 with APBs. Perturbation of the interactions between NBS1/Mre11 and APBs correlates with reduced BrdUrd incorporation associated with APBs, consistent with decreased DNA synthesis at these sites. Taken together, these results support a model in which NBS1 has a vital role in the assembly of APBs, which function to maintain telomeres in human ALT cells.","['Wu, Guikai', 'Jiang, Xianzhi', 'Lee, Wen-Hwa', 'Chen, Phang-Lang']","['Wu G', 'Jiang X', 'Lee WH', 'Chen PL']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Institute of Biotechnology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78245, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'BRCA1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA Repair Enzymes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 May 15;63(10):2589-95.,,,"['CA81020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94170/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this transgene is expressed at very low levels in the bone marrow cells of transgenic mice. Because the transgene includes only 6 kb of regulatory sequences from the human cathepsin G locus, we hypothesized that sequences required for high-level expression of the transgene might be located elsewhere in the cathepsin G locus and that a knock-in model might yield much higher expression levels and higher penetrance of disease. We, therefore, targeted a human PML-RARalpha cDNA to the 5' untranslated region of the murine cathepsin G gene, using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. This model produced a high-penetrance APL phenotype, with more than 90% of knock-in mice developing APL between 6 and 16 months of age. The latent period and phenotype of APL (including a low frequency of an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2) was similar to that of the previous transgenic model. Remarkably, however, the expression level of PML-RARalpha in bone marrow cells or APL cells was less than 3% of that measured in the low-penetrance transgenic model. Although the explanation for this result is not yet clear, one hypothesis suggests that very low levels of PML-RARalpha expression in early myeloid cells may be optimal for the development of APL in mice.","['Westervelt, Peter', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Pollock, Jessica L', 'Oldfather, Kristie', 'Holt, Matthew S', 'Zimonjic, Drazen B', 'Popescu, Nicholas C', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Westervelt P', 'Lane AA', 'Pollock JL', 'Oldfather K', 'Holt MS', 'Zimonjic DB', 'Popescu NC', 'DiPersio JF', 'Ley TJ']","['Washington University, Division of Oncology, 660 S Euclid Ave, Campus Box 8007, St Louis, MO 63110-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Penetrance', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3779 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44174-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 1;102(5):1857-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3779.

Targeting bcr-abl by treatment with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has proved to be highly efficient for controlling leukemic growth. However, it is unclear whether imatinib is sufficient to eradicate the disease because of primary or secondary resistance of leukemic cells. Therefore, targeting Bcr-Abl with an alternative approach is of great interest. We demonstrate that RNA interference (RNAi) with a breakpoint-specific short-interfering RNA (siRNA) is capable of decreasing Bcr-Abl protein expression and of antagonizing Bcr-Abl-induced biochemical activities. RNAi selectively inhibited Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth. Furthermore, bcr-abl-homologous siRNA increased sensitivity to imatinib in Bcr-Abl-overexpressing cells and in a cell line expressing the imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutation His396Pro, thereby antagonizing 2 of the major mechanisms of resistance to imatinib.","['Wohlbold, Lara', 'van der Kuip, Heiko', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Vornlocher, Hans-Peter', 'Knabbe, Cornelius', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Aulitzky, Walter E']","['Wohlbold L', 'van der Kuip H', 'Miething C', 'Vornlocher HP', 'Knabbe C', 'Duyster J', 'Aulitzky WE']","['Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Auerbachstrasse 110, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3899 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50519-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):2236-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3899.

We studied the prognostic impact of BAALC (Brain And Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic), a novel gene involved in leukemia, in 86 de novo AML patients with normal cytogenetics who were uniformly treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9621. BAALC expression was determined by comparative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in pretreatment blood samples, and patients were dichotomized at BAALC's median expression into low and high expressers. Low expressers had higher white counts (P =.03) and more frequent French-American-British M5 morphology (P =.007). Compared to low expressers, high BAALC expressers showed significantly inferior overall survival (OS; median, 1.7 vs 5.8 years, P =.02), event-free survival (EFS; median, 0.8 vs 4.9 years, P =.03), and disease-free survival (DFS; median, 1.4 vs 7.3 years, P =.03).

However, it is currently unknown if the presence of deletions influences the response to imatinib, an Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that has recently shown excellent hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML. We, therefore, compared hematologic and cytogenetic responses with imatinib in 397 patients with CML, and survival and progression in 354 of these patients, according to deletion status and disease phase. We found no difference in survival between patients with and without deletions, contrasting with previous reports in cohorts with a lower proportion of patients treated with imatinib. However, the time to disease progression on imatinib treatment was significantly shorter for patients with deletions, both in chronic phase (P =.02) and advanced phases (P =.02). Moreover, both in chronic phase and more advanced phases of CML, hematologic and cytogenetic responses were uniformly lower in patients with deletions, with significant differences seen for hematologic response (P =.04), for major cytogenetic response (P =.008) in chronic phase, and for hematologic response in advanced phases (P =.007) of CML.

GPI-80 is expressed mainly in human neutrophils. Our previous studies suggested that GPI-80 expression might be associated with myeloid differentiation. To verify this, we examined whether GPI-80 is expressed on the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 following treatment with differentiation inducers. GPI-80 expression was induced in cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to stimulate differentiation down the neutrophil pathway. On the other hand, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), another neutrophil-inducing reagent, induced no clear GPI-80 expression. Potent monocyte-inducing reagents such as 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also had no significant effect on the protein expression. GPI-80-positive cells were found in the well-differentiated CD11b-positive and transferrin-receptor-negative cell population. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which augments neutrophil differentiation of HL-60 cells, up-regulated GPI-80 expression in the presence of DMSO. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which is known to suppress the neutrophil maturation of cells, inhibited expression. Adhesion of DMSO-induced cells was regulated by anti-GPI-80 monoclonal antibody, similar to the regulation observed in neutrophils. These results suggest that use of DMSO to induce neutrophil differentiation provides suitable conditions for GPI-80 expression, and that this culture system may be a helpful model for further study of the regulation of GPI-80 expression during myeloid differentiation.","['Takeda, Yuji', 'Fu, Junfen', 'Suzuki, Kichiya', 'Sendo, Dai', 'Nitto, Takeaki', 'Sendo, Fujiro', 'Araki, Yoshihiko']","['Takeda Y', 'Fu J', 'Suzuki K', 'Sendo D', 'Nitto T', 'Sendo F', 'Araki Y']","['Department of Immunology and Parasitology, Yamagata University School of Medicine, Yamagata-City, 990-9585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.92 (VNN2 protein, human)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'CD11 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD18 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482703000715 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00071-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Jun 10;286(2):199-208. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00071-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENT: An 8-yr-old girl with 20.0 mg/dL serum calcium (reference range, 8.8-10.4 mg/dL) and 2.66 mmol/L ionized calcium (reference range, 1.13-1.32 mmol/L). INTERVENTION: Intravenous pamidronate and subcutaneous calcitonin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our patient presented with nausea, vomiting, lethargy, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness but, remarkably, did not exhibit electrocardiographic changes. Initial treatment with hydration at 8 mL x kg(-1) x hr(-1) and furosemide was ineffective. A single dose of 1 mg/kg intravenous pamidronate given over 24 hrs complemented by three doses of 5 units/kg subcutaneous calcitonin over 36 hrs lowered serum calcium to a normal range within 3 days. Side effects noted were hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. They were most pronounced 7-9 days after treatment, stabilized with supplementation, and returned to acceptable ranges by 1 month without need for ongoing electrolyte supplements. A renal computed tomographic scan did not show nephrocalcinosis. The patient remained free from recurrence of hypercalcemia 6 wks after initiating chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Extreme hypercalcemia can be a presenting feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but it may not result in life-threatening organ dysfunction. Combined treatment with pamidronate and calcitonin should be considered for treating hypercalcemia that does not respond to conventional therapy with hydration and furosemide.","['Mathur, Mudit', 'Sykes, J A', 'Saxena, V R', 'Rao, S P', 'Goldman, G M']","['Mathur M', 'Sykes JA', 'Saxena VR', 'Rao SP', 'Goldman GM']","[""Division of Pediatric Critical Care, Department of Pediatrics, SUNY Downstate College of Medicine, The Children's Hospital at Downstate, Brooklyn, NY, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Calcitonin/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Diphosphonates/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pamidronate', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/07/30 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.PCC.0000059423.62268.02 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2003 Apr;4(2):252-5. doi: 10.1097/01.PCC.0000059423.62268.02.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, this agent has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) through a restricted-use program. Its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties are currently under study in a number of clinical conditions. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacology of thalidomide; its approved and off-label uses in dermatologic, oncologic, and gastrointestinal conditions; and adverse events associated with its use. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-June 2002), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2002), and EMBASE (1990-June 2002). Search terms included but were not limited to thalidomide, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, therapeutic use, and teratogenicity, as well as terms for specific disease states and adverse events. Further publications were identified from the reference lists of the reviewed articles. Abstracts of recent symposia were obtained from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Web site. RESULTS: Thalidomide is thought to exert its therapeutic effect through the modulation of cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In addition to its approved indication for ENL, thalidomide has been studied in various other conditions, including graft-versus-host disease, discoid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, malignant gliomas, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, colorectal carcinoma, oral aphthous ulcers, Behcet's disease, Crohn's disease, and HIV/AIDS-associated wasting. Adverse events most frequently associated with its use include somnolence, constipation, rash, peripheral neuropathy, and thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: Use of thalidomide is limited by toxicity, limited efficacy data, and restricted access. Evidence of its efficacy in conditions other than ENL awaits the results of controlled clinical trials.","['Matthews, S James', 'McCoy, Christopher']","['Matthews SJ', 'McCoy C']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy, Bouve College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. s.matthews@neu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Leprostatic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/etiology', 'Anti-HIV Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dermatologic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leprostatic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",222,2003/05/17 05:00,2003/07/11 05:00,['2003/05/17 05:00'],"['2003/05/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0149291803800851 [pii]', '10.1016/s0149-2918(03)80085-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2003 Feb;25(2):342-95. doi: 10.1016/s0149-2918(03)80085-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found 682 cases (81.8%) with a typical ALL immunophenotype, and the remaining 152 (18.2%) were considered to have AML. In 29 of the 152 patients with AML studied, a diagnosis of AMKL was established. These 29 cases represented 19.1% of the cases of AML and 3.48% of the total cases of AL during the time span covered by the study. Twenty-four percent of the cases occurred in infants 2 years old or younger and 41.4% occurred in children 41 months of age or younger. In contrast, in only 18.6% of the patients with AML (M0-M6), the diagnosis was established before 42 months of age and in 17% before their second year of life. Clinical presentation was not strikingly different than that observed in patients with other types of AML, and the time interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was also similar, though in a small subset of patients, the clinical course was characterized by a chronic slowly progressive disorder extending over weeks or months resembling smoldering leukemia or chronic myelofibrosis with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. Bone marrow (BM) fibrosis was a constant features in our patients; 75% of the patients studied showed this complication at the time of diagnosis. Some rather unusual findings in this study were intense skeletal pains from multiple osteolytic lesions, the presence of soft-tissue tumor, and the presence of cohesive scanty clusters of primitive-looking blast cells in BM aspirates. Several interesting cytogenetic findings in our study were t(1;22)(p13;q13) in a 14-year-old boy, t(9;22)(q34;q11) in one patient, and monosomy 7 in two patients. Another important finding in our study was the clinical association with colonic adenocarcinoma in one patient, an association that to our knowledge has not been reported previously. In conclusion, our data suggest that the incidence of AMKL in Mexico might be higher than those reported in Caucasian white pediatric population, and that biologic and cytogenetic profile may differ from those of western countries, but more studies are needed to corroborate cytogenetic heterogeneity, ethnic and geographic diversity. Early onset of the disease, low WBC counts, slight thrombocytopenia or normal platelet counts, and BM fibrosis were characteristic distinctive features of at least half of the patients with this subtype of AML.","['Paredes-Aguilera, Rogelio', 'Romero-Guzman, Lina', 'Lopez-Santiago, Norma', 'Trejo, Rosa Arana']","['Paredes-Aguilera R', 'Romero-Guzman L', 'Lopez-Santiago N', 'Trejo RA']","['Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Colonia Insurgentes-Cuicuilco, Mexico. rapa3852@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*blood/*complications/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies']",,2003/05/16 05:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/05/16 05:00'],"['2003/05/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10320 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Jun;73(2):71-80. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10320.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doses selected for the 2-year studies were based primarily on the effects on body weights and survival of rats in a 26-week study. During the first 6 months of the 2-year study, because of good survival and the absence of observable toxic effects in female rats, additional groups (termed second study) of 52 F344/N female rats were started at higher dietary concentrations of 0, 50, and 100 ppm mirex. Based on feed consumption data, the estimated average intake per day was 0, 0.007, 0.075, 0.75, 1.95, and 3.85 mg mirex/kg body weight for male rats and female rats in the first study, and 0, 3.9, and 7.7 mg/kg for female rats in the additional study. Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Survival in Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of male rats that received 25 or 50 ppm mirex were 5%-18% lower than those of the controls throughout most of the study; mean body weights of female rats that received 50 or 100 ppm mirex were 4%-18% lower than those of the controls after week 40; mean body weights of groups receiving 0.1, 1.0, or 10 ppm were similar to those of controls. Feed consumption by dosed male rats was 83%-91% that by controls, and that by dosed female rats was 86%-99% that by controls. The top dietary exposure groups of rats received the equivalent of 3.85 mg mirex/kg body weight, whereas the 100-ppm group of female rats (second study) averaged 7.7 mg/kg. At the end of the study, survival of male rats that received 25 or 50 ppm of mirex was lower than that of controls, whereas survival of all dosed groups of female rats was similar to that of controls (male: control, 44/52; 0.1 ppm, 37/52; 1 ppm, 36/52; 10 ppm, 37/52; 25 ppm, 19/52; 50 ppm, 15/52; female-- first study: 38/52; 38/52; 35/52; 41/52; 35/52; female-- second study: control, 44/52; 50 ppm, 44/52; 100 ppm, 39/52). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The most notable compound-related effects were observed in the liver of male and female rats. Fatty metamorphosis, cytomegaly, angiectasis (males only), and necrosis of the liver were observed at increased incidences in dosed rats. The incidences of of neoplastic nodules of the liver were dose related, and in the 10-, 25-, and 50-ppm groups of males and the 50- and 100-ppm groups of females (second study), they were markedly greater than those in controls (52/group-- male: control, 3; 0.1 ppm, 5; 1 ppm, 5;10 ppm, 14; 25 ppm, 15; 50 ppm, 26; female (second study): control, 2; 50 ppm, 23; 100 ppm, 30). In the first study in female rats, the incidences of neoplastic nodules were not significantly different between control and dosed groups (10; 5; 4; 5; 9; 7). The 10 neoplastic nodules of the liver seen in the control group (19%) was significantly greater than the mean incidence observed historically (57/2,015; 2.8%). The incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in control and dosed groups were relatively low and were not significantly different between groups. The incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland occurred with a positive trend in male rats (8/51; 7/52; 13/52; 11/52; 18/51, 19/51); the incidences in the 25- and 50-ppm male rats were greater than that in controls; malignant pheochromocytomas were observed in 2 controls and in 2 mirex-exposed male rats. The incidence of pheochromocytomas in 50-ppm female rats in the first study was marginally greater than that in controls (control, 1/51; 50 ppm, 6/52); this borderline increase was not observed in the second female rat study and thus is not considered to be due to the dietary administration of mirex. Nephropathy occurred at similar incidences in control and mirex-exposed groups of male and female rats; however, the severity of this nonneoplastic lesion was judged to be slightly greater in the groups given 25, 50, or 100 ppm mirex (male: severe vs. moderate in controls; femas given 25, 50, or 100 ppm mirex (male: severe vs. moderate in controls; female: moderate to severe vs. moderate). Hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis was observed in dosed male rats (0/51; 2/51; 2/52; 5/52; 14/51; 9/52). Transitional cell papillomas of the renal pelvis in male rats occurred with a positive trend (P&lt;0.02) (0/51; 0/51; 0/52; 1/51; 3/52). The highest incidence previously observed in untreated male F344/N rats in NTP studies is 1/48, and the mean historical incidence is 5/1,968 (0.3&percnt;). In both the first and second studies in female rats, the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia showed dosed-related increases (first study: 8/52; 8/52; 11/52; 14/52; 18/52; 18/52; second study: 6/52; 9/52; 14/52). When the data from both studies are combined, the incidences are significantly increased in the 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-ppm groups. The mean historical incidence is 19&percnt; (375/2,021). For the thyroid gland, there was a positive trend for follicular cell neoplasms in male rats (0/51; 1/50; 0/47; 1/47; 0/35; 4/49) and a negative trend for C-cell neoplasms in male rats (8/51; 6/50; 4/47; 7/47; 3/35; 0/49) and infemale rats in the first study (12/50; 13/50; 7/48; 9/47; 6/48; 2/46). Neither observation is considered to be associated with the dietary administration of mirex. Genetic Toxicology: Mirex was not mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium-microsome assay when tested in a preincubation protocol in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation in strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537. Mirex did not induce either sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence or absence of S9. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies of mirex, there is clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female F344/N rats, as primarily indicated by marked increased incidences of benign neoplastic nodules of the liver, as well as by increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland and transitional cell papillomas of the kidney in males and by increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in females. Nonneoplastic effects induced by mirex include cytomegaly, fatty metamorphosis, angiectasis (males only), and cellular necrosis in the liver.

In the 14-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female rats and mice were exposed to methyl methacrylate at concentrations of up to 5,000 ppm. All male and female rats and eight male and eight female mice exposed at 5,000 ppm died, one male and nine female rats and four male and no female mice exposed at 3,000 ppm died, and one male and three female rats and two male and one female mouse exposed at 2,000 ppm died; all rats and mice exposed at 500 or 1,000 ppm survived. Compared with the controls, the body weights of the exposed male and female rats and mice were lower. Compound-related lesions included inflammation associated with necrosis and loss of olfactory epithelium in the nasal turbinates in both male and female rats; malacia and gliosis in female rats; inflammation of the nasal turbinates and nasal epithelium metaplasia in both male and female mice; and renal cortical necrosis, renal cortical tubular degeneration, renal focal mineralization, and liver necrosis in male mice. Based on these results, 2-year inhalation toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted in which groups of 50 male rats were exposed to methyl methacrylate at 0, 500, or 1,000 ppm; female rats at 0, 250, or 500 ppm; and male and female mice at 0, 500, or 1,000 ppm. In the 2-year studies, the body weights of the low dose and high dose male and female rats were within 10% of those of the controls. There was no difference in survival between the dosed male and female rats and the controls. Incidences of inflammation of the nasal cavity and degeneration of the olfactory sensory epithelium were greater in the dosed male and female rats than in the controls, with lesions seen in virtually all high dose animals. An increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was observed in female rats exposed to methyl methacrylate at 500 ppm compared with the controls (control, 11/50; 250 ppm, 13/50; 500 ppm, 20/50). This increase was not significant by life table tests, the method of analysis most appropriate for this fatal neoplasm. The mean body weights of dosed male and female mice were 5%-8% lower than those of the controls at the end of the 2-year studies. However, during most of the second year of the studies, body weights of dosed male mice and high dose female mice were 10%-18% lower than those of the controls. Survival rates of the dosed and control mice were similar. Incidences of inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia of the nasal cavity and degeneration of the olfactory sensory epithelium were significantly greater in all dosed groups of male and female mice compared with those of the controls. Compound-related neoplastic lesions were not found in the dosed mice. Significant dose-related decreases were observed in the incidences of pituitary gland and preputial gland tumors in male rats, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in male mice, hepatocellular adenomas in both male and female mice, and pituitary gland adenomas or adenocarcinomas (combined) and uterine adenocarcinomas in female mice. Methyl methacrylate was not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA1535, TA97, or TA98 of Salmonella typhimurium in the presence or absence of male rat or hamster liver S9 when assayed by a preincubational protocol but gave a positive response in L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma cells in the presence or absence of male rat liver S9. In cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, methyl methacrylate produced a reproducible, dose-related increase in the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges, both with and without rat liver S9. A slight, dose-related increase in chromosomal aberrations was also induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of S9; in the presence of S9, an increase in the frequency of aberrations was seen only at the highest, near-lethalas seen only at the highest, near-lethal dose of 5 mg/ml. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year carcinogenesis studies on methyl methacrylate. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of methyl methacrylate for male F344/N rats exposed at 500 or 1,000 ppm, for female F344/N rats exposed at 250 or 500 ppm, or for male and female B6C3F1 mice exposed at 500 or 1,000 ppm. Inhalation of methyl methacrylate was associated with inflammation of the nasal cavity and degeneration of the olfactory sensory epithelium in male and female rats and mice; epithelial hyperplasia of the nasal cavity was also observed in exposed mice.

This antibiotic is used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, genital and urinary tract infections, and otitis media in children. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of ampicillin trihydrate (97%-99% pure) were conducted by administering the chemical in corn oil by gavage to groups of 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex, 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Male and female rats received doses of 0, 750, or 1,500 mg/kg, and male and female mice received doses of 0, 1,500, or 3,000 mg/kg. Doses selected for the 2-year studies were based on the lack of body weight effects and histopathologic effects at 2,400 mg/kg in the 14-day studies and 3,000 mg/kg in the 13-week studies. Clinical signs in the 13-week studies included diarrhea at 3,000 mg/kg in male and female rats and male mice. Corn oil suspensions containing more than 300 mg ampicillin trihydrate/ml were too viscous to be administered by gavage; therefore, a high dose of 1,500 mg/kg was selected for rats and a high dose of 3,000 mg/kg was selected for mice. During the 2-year studies, mean body weights of male and female rats were similar to or slightly increased over those of the corresponding vehicle control groups. Mean body weights of low dose and high dose male mice were similar to those of the corresponding vehicle group during year 1 of the study but were slightly below those of the vehicle control group during the last half of the study. Mean body weights of low dose and high dose female mice were greater than those of the vehicle controls throughout most of the study. No significant differences in survival were observed in groups of rats or mice of either sex. Clinical signs observed in dosed rats included diarrhea, excessive urination, and chromodacryorrhea and in dosed mice included increased salivation and decreased activity. In male rats, administration of ampicillin trihydrate was associated with an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia (vehicle control, 5/50; low dose, 14/50; high dose, 13/50). Malignant lymphomas were observed in one additional vehicle control male rat and two low dose male rats. Lymphocytic leukemia was seen in one high dose rat. High dose male rats showed increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland medulla (13/50; 12/50; 23/49). Malignant pheochromocytomas were observed in 1/50 vehicle control, 5/50 low dose, and 1/49 high dose male rats. The incidence of adrenal gland medullary hyperplasia was not increased in male rats (14/50; 10/50; 8/49). There were increased incidences of C-cellhyperplasia of the thyroid gland in low dose male and high dose female rats. High dose male rats showed increased incidences of hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the forestomach. In male and female mice, ampicillin trihydrate administration was associated with increased incidences of forestomach lesions, including ulcers, inflammation, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and evidence of fungal infection. Ampicillin trihydrate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced male Syrian hamster or male Sprague-Dawley rat liver S9 when tested according to preincubation protocol. Ampicillin trihydrate was not mutagenic in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells with or without metabolic activation. Ampicillin trihydrate did not cause chromosomal aberrations or sister-chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without metabolic activation. An audit was conducted for these 2-year studies. Animal/carcass identification discrepancies were observed in rats and mice. The most common findings were the failure to clip some toes in rats and opened ear holes in mice. A review of the inlife data (including body weights, clinical observations, and dosing records) indicrecords) indicated that animals had not been interchanged among groups. The data are considered adequate to support the conclusions. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity of ampicillin trihydrate for male F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and by marginally increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity for female F344/N rats receiving 750 or 1,500 mg/kg or for male and female B6C3F1 mice receiving 1,500 or 3,000 mg/kg per day.

Because of its extensive production and use and the absence of carcinogenicity data, carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering 1,4-dichlorobenzene (greater than 99% pure) in corn oil by gavage (5 days per week) to male F344/N rats at doses of 0, 150, or 300 mg/kg and to female F344/N rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice at doses of 0, 300, or 600 mg/kg per day for 2 years (50 animals per group). Fourteen-day and 13-week studies were performed to characterize the toxicity, identify affected sites, and set doses for the 2-year studies. Clinical chemistry and hematologic studies were performed during the 13-week studies to assess the effects of 1,4-dichlorobenzene on the liver, kidney, and hematopoietic system and to assess whether the compound produced hepatic porphyria. Two 13-week studies were performed in rats. In the first study, rats were dosed with 300-1,500 mg/kg 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Because histologic changes were observed in the kidney of male rats at all doses, a second 13-week study was performed at doses of 38-600 mg/kg. In the 13-week studies, survival was decreased in groups of male rats given 1,200 or 1,500 mg/kg and in female rats given 1,500 mg/kg. Weight gain was decreased in male rats receiving doses of 300 mg/kg or more and in female rats given doses of 1,200 or 1,500 mg/kg. Doses of 1,200 or 1,500 mg/kg produced degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, hypoplasia of the bone marrow, lymphoid depletion of the spleen and thymus, and epithelial necrosis of the nasal turbinates in male and female rats. Renal tubular cell degeneration was observed in male rats receiving 300 mg/kg or more in the first study, but only slight changes were seen at 300 mg/kg in the second study. Liver weight to brain weight ratios were increased at 900 mg/kg or more for both male and female rats. The kidney weight to brain weight ratio was increased in male rats receiving doses of 600 mg/kg or more. Administration of 1,4-dichlorobenzene to rats for 13 weeks produced slight but statistically significant decreases in the hematocrit, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin level in all males receiving doses of 300-1,200 mg/kg. No clear hematologic changes were observed in female rats. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene produced minimal changes in clinical chemistry parameters in the 13-week studies. Serum cholesterol levels were increased by doses of 600 mg/kg or more in male rats and 900 mg/kg or more in female rats. Serum triglycerides were reduced by doses of 300 mg/kg or more in male rats. The blood urea nitrogen level was increased slightly in male rats dosed with 900 mg/kg or more. Urinary porphyrins were increased slightly in male rats administered 1,200 or 1,500 mg/kg and female rats receiving 1,200 mg/kg. However, these increases were modest and indicative of a mild porphyrinuria rather than hepatic porphyria. Liver porphyrins were not increased at any dose. Two 13-week studies were performed in mice. The doses selected for the first study were 600-1,800 mg/kg. Survival was decreased in male and female mice receiving doses of 1,500 mg/kg or more, and body weight gain was decreased at all doses. Hepatocellular degeneration was observed in both sexes at all doses, and the liver weight to brain weight ratio was increased at doses of 900 mg/kg or more. Serum cholesterol levels were increased in male mice at doses of 900 mg/kg or more, whereas serum protein and triglycerides were increased at doses of 1,500 mg/kg or more. These relatively modest clinical chemistry changes probably reflect the hepatic effects of this compound. The white blood cell count was reduced significantly in male mice receiving doses of 600 mg/kg or more and female mice receiving 1,000 mg/kg or more, but this effect was not dramatic. Hepatic porphyria was not found in mice at any dose in the 13-week study. Because hepatic effects were seen in all dose groups in the first study, a second 13-week study was performed at doses of 85-900 mg/kg. In this study, hepatocellularellular cytomegaly was observed im male and female mice at doses of 675 mg/kg or more but not at 338 mg/kg. Renal damage was not observed in mice in either 13-week study. Based on the histopathologic findings in the kidney of male rats and in the liver of both sexes of rats and mice in the 13-week studies, the doses selected for the 2-year studies were 150 and 300 mg/kg for male rats and 300 and 600 mg/kg for female rats and male and female mice. In the 2-year studies, survival of female rats and of both sexes of mice was comparable to that of the vehicle controls; survival of high dose male rats was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls (vehicle control, 32/50; low dose, 31/50; high dose, 20/50). Mean body weights of high dose male rats were 5&percnt;-8&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 38, and those of high dose female rats were 5&percnt;-7&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 55. Mean body weights of mice dosed with 1,4-dichlorobenzene were comparable to those of vehicle controls throughout the studies. Administration of 1,4-dichlorobenzene to male rats increased the average seveity of nephropathy and caused epithelial hyperplasia of the renal pelvis (1/50; 30/50; 31/50), mineralization of the collecting tubules in the renal medulla (4/50; 46/50; 47/50), and focal hyperplasia of renal tubular epithelium (0/50; 1/50; 9/50). There were increased incidences of nephropathy in both low and high dose female rats compared with vehicle controls (21/49; 32/50; 41/49). 1,4-Dichlorobenzene produced a dose-related increase in the incidence of tubular cell adenocarcinomas of the kidney in male rats (1/50; 3/50; 7/50); one tubular cell adenoma was observed in a high dose male rat. These malignant tumors are uncommon in male F344/N rats. They have been diagnosed in only 4/1,098 (0.4&percnt;) corn oil gavage controls in previous NTP studies. There were no tubular cell tumors in dosed or vehicle control female rats. There was a marginal increase in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in dosed male rats compared with that in vehicle controls (5/50; 7/50; 11/50). 1,4-Dichlorobenzene increased the incidences of nonneoplastic liver lesions in male and female mice, including alteration in cell size (cytomegaly and karyomegaly), hepatocellular degeneration, and individual cell necrosis. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene also increased the incidences of nephropathy in male mice and renal tubular regeneration in female mice. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene increased the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in high dose male (14/50; 11/49; 32/50) and female (5/50; 5/48; 19/50) mice and hepatocellular adenomas in dosed male (5/50; 13/49; 16/50) and high dose female (10/50; 6/48; 21/50) mice. Hepatoblastomas were observed in four high dose male mice but not in vehicle controls. This rare tumor has not occurred in 1,091 male vehicle control mice in NTP studies. An increase in thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia was observed in dosed male mice (1/47; 4/48; 10/47), and there was a marginal positive trend in the incidence of follicular cell adenomas of the thyroid gland in female mice (0/48; 0/45; 3/46). Pheochromocytomas (benign or malignant, combined) of the adrenal gland occurred with a positive trend in dosed male mice, and the incidence in the high dose group was significantly greater than in vehicle controls (0/47; 2/48; 4/49). The incidence of adrenal gland medullary hyperplasia in male mice was 2/47; 4/48; and 4/49. Focal hyperplasia of the adrenal gland capsule was also observed in dosed male mice (11/47;21/48; 28/49). 1,4-Dichlorobenzene was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without activation by Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rat or male Syrian hamster liver S9 when tested according to a preincubational protocol at concentrations up to 100 ug/plate. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene did not induce forward mutations in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK&plusmn; assay in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation; however, the results were equivocal in this system in the presence of metabolic activation. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene did not produce an increase in sister-chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture with or without exogenous metabolic activation. No increase in micronucleated cells was seen in erythrocytes of mice from the first 13-week studies. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of 1,4-dichlorobenzene. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, 1,4-dichlorobenzene produced clear evidence of carcinogenicity for male F344/N rats, as shown by an increased incidence of renal tubular cell adenocarcinomas. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity for female F344/N rats receiving doses of 300 or 600 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity for both male and female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatocellular adenomas. Marginal increases were observed in the incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland in male mice. Nonneoplastic effects in the kidney of male and female rats, in the liver of male and female mice, and in the thyroid gland and adrenal gland of male mice were also associated with the administration of 1,4-dichlorobenzene.

In 1977, total U.S. human exposure was estimated at 1.9 x 107 g per year. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies because of a lack of previous long-term studies and because two other sympathomimetic agents (soterenol hydrochloride and mesuprine hydrochloride) produced mesovarial leiomyomas in Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of USP-grade phenylephrine hydrochloride were conducted by administering diets containing the chemical (99% pure) to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex in studies of 14 days, 12 weeks, and 2 years. In the 14-day studies, no toxic effects were seen in rats or mice fed diets containing up to 2,000 ppm phenylephrine hydrochloride. Doses were increased in the 12-week studies, and deaths of male rats and male mice were observed in groups fed diets containing 10,000 or 20,000 ppm; 1/10 male rats in the 5,000-ppm group died. Other than inflammatory eye lesions (considered secondary to the pharmacologic drying action of the chemical), no specific organ toxicity was noted. Body weights decreased as concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the diet were increased, and feed consumption was lower in dosed rats. Doses of 0, 620, and 1,250 ppm for rats and 0, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm for mice were selected for the 2-year studies because of the decreased body weight gains in animals given higher doses in the 12-week studies. In the 2-year studies, the approximate amount of phenylephrine hydrochloride consumed per day was 24 mg/kg for low dose rats, 50 mg/kg for high dose rats, 133 mg/kg for low dose mice, and 270 mg/kg for high dose mice. Body weight differences in rats appeared to be dose related, and dosed animals were 3%-15% lighter than controls. Body weights of dosed mice averaged 3%-14% lower than those of controls throughout the 2-year studies. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than that of the controls (control, 30/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 42/50); differences in survival were not significant for female rats (42/50; 34/50; 36/50), male mice (35/50; 38/50; 43/50), or female mice (37/50; 34/50; 34/50). Few nonneoplastic lesions were related to phenylephrine hydrochloride dosing in rats or mice. Chronic focal inflammation of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 2/50; 13/50; 17/50; female:17/50; 28/50; 35/50). Inflammation of the prostate was seen more frequently in dosed than in control males (10/50; 24/50; 24/50). The incidence of focal cellular change in the liver was increased slightly in high dose male mice (0/50; 2/50; 7/50). In male rats, mononuclear cell leukemia (24/50; 9/50; 5/50) and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland (14/49; 11/50; 2/50) occurred with negative trends, and the incidences in the high dose group were lower than those in the controls. No increases in neoplasia were seen in dosed male or female rats or mice. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98) with or without Aroclor 1254-induced liver S9 from male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Syrian hamsters. The results of mutagenicity studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride were equivocal in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay in the absence of S9; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Phenylephrine hydrochloride induced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) but not chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The increase in SCEs was seen only in the absence of metabolic activation with S9. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of phenylephrine hydrochloride for male B6C3F1 mice given 1,250 or 2,500 ppm in feed. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than of high dose male rats was greater than that of controls, and the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and pheochromocytomas were lower in dosed than in control male rats. Inflammation was observed more frequently in the liver and prostate gland of dosed male rats than in controls.

Dimethyl methylphosphonate is also used as a flame retardant, a preignition additive for gasoline, an antifoam agent, a plasticizer and stabilizer, a textile conditioner and antistatic agent, and an additive for solvents and low-temperature hydraulic fluids. The United States produces 0.2-2 million pounds (91,000-910,000 kg) of per year. Gavage was chosen as the route of administration for all four candidate ""simulants"" to mimic potential exposure. Experimental Design: Dimethyl methylphosphonate was administered in corn oil by gavage to male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in single-administration, 15-day, and 13-week studies to obtain toxicity data, to establish dose levels for the 2-year studies, and to identify target tissues. Additional studies were also performed to determine toxicity to the reproductive system of male F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice and to study the potential for genetic damage in bacteria, mammalian cells, and Drosophila. Single-Administration Studies: In the single-administration studies, dimethyl methylphosphonate was given to rats and mice at doses up to 6,810 mg/kg body weight. No compound-related deaths were seen in male or female rats or male mice; two high dose female mice died. Rats exhibited inactivity, unsteady gait, and prostration after dosing; mice were inactive after dosing. Fifteen-Day Studies: Rats and mice received doses of 0, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 15,000 mg/kg dimethyl methylphosphonate per day. Compound-related deaths occurred in the three highest dose groups of rats and the two highest dose groups of mice. Rats receiving doses of 2,500 mg/kg or higher were inactive and at 5,000 or 10,000 mg/kg had an unsteady gait after dosing; mice exhibited inactivity, shallow breathing, and prostration at doses of 10,000 mg/kg or higher. No lesions were reported in rats. Nonneoplastic lesions of the stomach were seen in some male mice at doses of 1,250 mg/kg and higher and in some female mice at doses of 5,000 mg/kg and higher. Thirteen-Week Studies: Dimethyl methylphosphonate was given at doses up to 8,000 mg/kg per day. Compound-related deaths occurred at 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 mg/kg in rats and at 4,000 and 8,000 mg/kg in mice. Mean body weights of rats at 1,000 mg/kg and mice at 2,000 mg/kg were similar to those of the vehicle controls; decreased weight gain was seen at higher doses. No compound-related clinical signs were reported. Minimal to mild renal and testicular lesions were seen at all doses in male rats, but the severity of these lesions did not increase with increasing dose of the chemical. No apparent target tissues were identified in female rats or male and female mice. Doses selected for the 2-year studies were based on body weight effects and mortality seen in the 13-week studies; the lesions seen in the kidney of male rats at the end of the 13-week studies were judged not to be life threatening. In the 2-year studies, dimethyl methylphosphonate was administered in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg per day to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex and at 0, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg per day to groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex. All animals were dosed 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male rats were 5%-10% lower than those of the vehicle controls between weeks 28 and 76 and were 10%-24% lower between weeks 80 and 104. Mean body weights of high dose female rats were 8%-12% lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 80. Survival of male rats was greater than 50% in all groups until week 80, and after this time, survival decreased in both groups, with the survival at the end of the study being 27/50 in vehicle control, 17/50 in low dose, and 4/50 in high dose groups. Survival of in low dose, and 4/50 in high dose groups. Survival of low dose female rats was comparable to that of the vehicle controls, but the final survival of high dose female rats was decreased (vehicle control, 30/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 23/50). No other compound-related clinical signs were observed. Mean body weights of high dose male mice were 7&percnt;-16&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle control males between weeks 36 and 76, and those of high dose female mice were 6&percnt;-12&percnt; lower between weeks 88 and 103. Decreased survival between weeks 23 and 45 in high dose male mice was associated with fighting. Seventeen high dose male and 22 high dose female mice died during week 45; these deaths were associated with the accidental administration of a dose mixture that had a concentration 34&percnt; greater than the targeted amount. Eleven low dose male mice died on the same day during week 77. By the end of the study, 29/50 vehicle control, 12/50 low dose, and 0/50 high dose male mice were alive; 41/50, 30/50, and 2/50 female mice survived to the end of the study. Renal Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Administration of dimethyl methylphosphonate to male rats increased the average severity of nephropathy and caused mineralization (calcification) of the collecting tubules in the renal papilla (12/50; 41/50; 36/49), hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium lining the renal pelvis and overlying the renal papilla (0/50; 23/50; 21/49), and focal hyperplasia of the renal tubular epithelium (0/50; 8/50; 9/49). Administration of dimethyl methylphosphonate to male rats was also associated with the occurrence of rare renal tubular cell adenocarcinomas (0/50; 2/50; 3/49) and papillomas of the transitional epithelium lining of the renal pelvis (0/50; 2/50; 3/49); a transitional cell carcinoma occurred in a low dose male rat. There were no tubular cell or transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney in female rats. Hematopoietic System Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was increased in high dose male rats (10/50; 11/50; 17/50). Genetic Toxicity: Dimethyl methylphosphonate was not mutagenic when tested in the Salmonella typhimurium/microsome assay by the preincubational protocol with strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without metabolic activation. The chemical did induce forward mutations in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK&plusmn; assay system in the absence of metabolic activation. Treatment of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with dimethyl methylphosphonate did not induce chromosomal aberrations; however, sister chromatid exchanges were induced after exposure to this chemical in both the presence and absence of metabolic activation. When fed to Drosophila, dimethyl methylphosphonate induced a significant increase in the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations but did not induce reciprocal translocations. Dimethyl methylphosphonate caused a dominant lethal effect in male rats and mice. Studies of Reproductive Effects: Dimethyl methylphosphonate caused a dose-related increase in the number of fetal resorptions in undosed female rats and mice mated with males that received the chemical by gavage in water 5 days per week for 13 weeks at doses of 0-2,000 mg/kg per day. After the 13-week dosing period, histopathologic changes were seen in the kidney and testis of male rats but not in male mice; dosed male rats sired fewer litters and fewer pups per litter. Dose-related decreases in sperm count and sperm motility occurred in male rats but not in male mice. Toxic effects to the reproductive system of male rats and mice were reversible after a 13-to 14-week recovery period. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies on dimethyl methylphosphonate. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of dimethyl methylphosphonate for male F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of tubular cell hyperplasia, tubular cell adenocarcinomas, hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium, and transitional cell papillomas of the kidney. There was an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male rats at 1,000 mg/kg. Renal toxicity and decreased survival occurred in dosed male rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of dimethyl methylphosphonate for female F344/N rats given doses of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg. The study in male B6C3F1 mice was an inadequate study of carcinogenic activity because of decreased survival in both dosed groups. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice receiving dimethyl methylphosphonate at 1,000 mg/kg; decreased survival of female mice at 2,000 mg/kg made this group inadequate for determination of carcinogenic activity.

Exposure to ethylene oxide is greatest in the health care industry, where an estimated 75,000 workers are potentially exposed. Ethylene oxide was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies in B6C3F1 mice because of its extensive production; the potential for human exposure in the workplace, from medical devices, or from food; the positive results of genetic toxicology assays; and the previous use of only F344/N rats in inhalation carcinogenicity studies. Two inhalation studies reported in 1984 by Snellings et al. and by Lynch et al. demonstrated carcinogenic responses in F344/N rats. Results were similar in both studies and consisted of increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia, peritoneal mesotheliomas, and primary brain tumors. Experimental Design: Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of ethylene oxide (greater than 99% pure) were conducted by exposing groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex to air containing 0, 50, or 100 ppm ethylene oxide, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 102 weeks. These doses were selected because, in 14-week studies, all mice exposed at 600 ppm died within 1 week, and all mice exposed at 400 ppm died by week 4. Rhinitis was observed in both sexes exposed at 200, 400, and 600 ppm as was renal tubular degeneration in both sexes at 100, 200, and 400 ppm. The latter effects observed at 100 ppm were slight and deemed not to be life threatening in 2-year studies. Two-Year Studies: Survival of exposed and control mice was comparable in the 2-year studies (male: control, 28/50; low dose, 31/50; high dose, 34/50; female: 25/50; 24/50;31/50). Final mean body weights in exposed mice were 95%-102% of those of the controls. No compound-related clinical signs were observed. Those neoplastic lesions that occurred at elevated incidences in mice exposed to ethylene oxide are reported in the following table (see page 6 of the Technical Report). In male mice, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, and papillary cystadenomas of the harderian gland occurred with positive trends. In female mice, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, papillary cystadenomas of the harderian gland, malignant lymphomas, and uterine adenocarcinomas occurred with positive trends. Mammary gland tumors also were increased in exposed female mice. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of ethylene oxide. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for B6C3F1 mice as indicated by dose-related increased incidences of benign or malignant neoplasms of the lung and benign neoplasms of the harderian gland in both male and female B6C3F1 mice following exposure to ethylene oxide vapors at 50 and 100 ppm. In female mice, ethylene oxide caused additional malignant neoplasms of the uterus, mammary gland, and hematopoietic system (lymphoma).

In industry, dichloromethane is used as a solvent in paint removers, degreasing agents, aerosol propellants, and triacetate solutions; as a blowing agent in flexible urethane foams; and as a process solvent in the manufacture of steroids, antibiotics, vitamins, and tablet coatings. The use of dichloromethane as an extraction solvent for spice oleoresins, hops, and caffeine from coffee has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Dichloromethane has been used as an inhalation anesthetic and as a fumigant for grain and strawberries. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of dichloromethane (99% pure) were conducted by inhalation exposure of groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 102 weeks. The exposure concentrations used (0, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm for rats and 0, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm for mice) were selected on the basis of results from 13-week inhalation studies in which groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were exposed to dichloromethane at concentrations of 525-8,400 ppm 6 hours per day, 5 days per week. During the 2-year studies in rats, body weight gains for exposed males and females were comparable to those of the chamber controls. The survival of exposed male rats was comparable to that of the chamber controls; however, the survival of all groups of males at the termination of the study was low (control, 16/50; low dose, 16/50; mid dose, 17/50; high dose, 9/50). Most of the early deaths among male rats occurred during the final weeks of the study; the survival of male rats through week 86 of the study was 36/50, 39/50, 37/50, and 33/50. This decreased survival is believed to be related to the high incidence of leukemia (34/50; 26/50; 32/50; 35/50). Survival of female rats exposed at 4,000 ppm was reduced relative to that of the chamber controls (30/50; 22/50; 22/50; 15/50); leukemia occurred frequently in all female rat groups. Final mean body weights of high dose male mice and low and high dose female mice were 10%-17% lower than those of the chamber controls; these reductions occurred during the last 16 weeks of the study. The survival of dosed male mice and high dose female mice was reduced relative to that of the chamber controls (male: control, 39/50; low dose, 24/50; high dose, 11/50; female: 25/50; 25/50; 8/50). This reduced survival may have been due to the chemically induced development of liver and lung neoplasia in male and female mice. Increased incidences of benign mammary gland lesions (adenomas and fibroadenomas) occurred in male and female rats exposed to dichloromethane (male: 0/50; 0/50; 2/50; 5/50; female: 5/50; 11/50; 13/50; 23/50). The incidence of malignant mammary gland neoplasms was not increased in female rats (2/50; 2/50; 2/50; 0/50); none was observed in male rats. In addition, integumentary system tumors in the area of the mammary chain occurred with a positive trend in male rats (subcutaneous tissue fibroma or sarcoma: 1/50; 1/50; 2/50; 5/50); the combined incidence of all tumors in the mammary area in male rats was 1/50, 1/50, 4/50, and 9/50. Exposure to dichloromethane was associated with increased incidences of hepatic hemosiderosis, cytomegaly, cytoplasmic vacuolization, necrosis, granulomatous inflammation, and bile duct fibrosis in both male and female rats. There was a positive but marginal trend in the incidence of hepatocellular neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas (combined) in female rats (2/50; 1/50; 4/50; 5/50). The incidence of squamous metaplasia of the nasal cavity was increased in female rats exposed at 4,000 ppm (1/50; 2/50; 3/50; 9/50) but not in males (4/50; 5/50; 3/50; 3/50). No nasal cavity tumors were observed in rats. The increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in mid dose and high dose female rats (17/50; 17/50; 23/50; 23/50) were statistically significant by age-adjusted analyses. In male rats, mesotheliomas (arising primarily from the tunica vaginalis) occurred at increas) occurred at increased incidences (0/50; 2/50; 5/50; 4/50). Lung tumors occurred at increased incidences in male and female mice exposed to dichloromethane (alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas: male - 3/50; 19/50; 24/50; female - 2/50; 23/48; 28/48; alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas: male - 2/50; 10/50; 28/50; female - 1/50; 13/48; 29/48). Cytologic degeneration of the liver was observed at increased incidences in high dose male and dosed female mice (male: 0/50; 0/49; 22/49; female: 0/50; 23/48; 21/48). Incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or hepatocellular carcinomas (combined) were increased in high dose male and dosed female mice (male: 22/50; 24/49; 33/49; female: 3/50; 16/48; 40/48). There were also dose-related increases in the numbers of mice bearing multiple lung or liver neoplasms. Dose-related increases were observed in the incidences of testicular atrophy in male mice and uterine and ovarian atrophy in female mice; these effects are considered to be secondary responses to neoplasia. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of dichloromethane. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these inhalation studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenicity of dichloromethane for male F344/N rats as shown by an increased incidence of benign neoplasms of the mammary gland. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of dichloromethane for female F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of benign neoplasms of the mammary gland. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of dichloromethane for male and female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms and of hepatocellular neoplasms.

Doses used in the 2-year studies were 0, 312, or 625 mg/kg body weight per day administered by gavage in corn oil five times per week to groups of 70 male and female rats and 0, 125, or 250 mg/kg administered to groups of 50 male and female mice. Ten male and 10 female rats were killed after 6 and 12 months of dosing and examined for toxicity. No chemically related toxicity was observed in single-administration studies in which male and female rats received doses of chlorinated paraffins (C12, 60% chlorine) up to 13,600 mg/kg body weight and male and female up to 27,200 mg/kg. In 16-day studies, deaths did occur in groups of male and female rats given 7,500 mg/kg and in groups of male and female mice given doses of 1,875 mg/kg or higher. In 13-week studies, no chemically related deaths occurred among male and female rats given up to 5,000 mg/kg or mice given up to 2,000 mg/kg. Increased liver weights were noted in dosed rats and mice of each sex in the short-term studies, and dosed male rats showed more severe nephropathy than did vehicle controls. Doses selected for the 2-year studies were those that caused a minimal increase in liver weight in the short-term studies. Liver and kidney weights were increased in dosed rats killed at 6 and 12 months. Morphometric measurements demonstrated hepatocyte hypertrophy in the livers of dosed rats. Lesions of the kidney tubules and interstitial inflammation increased with dose in male and female rats. During the 2-year studies, body weights of high dose male rats were 8%-12% lower than those of vehicle controls after week 20, and body weights of dosed female mice were about 10% lower than those of vehicle controls during the second year. Survival of dosed male rats was lower than that of vehicle controls after about week 85, perhaps due to toxicity to the kidney (final survival: vehicle control, 27/50; low dose, 6/50; high dose, 3/50). Survival of low dose female rats was lower than that of vehicle controls (34/50; 24/50; 29/50). Survival of dosed male mice was not significantly different from that of vehicle controls (34/50; 31/50; 31/50). Survival of high dose female mice was lower than that of vehicle controls after about week 75 (final survival: 36/50; 31/50; 25/50). Chemically related nonneoplastic lesions consisted of hypertrophy and minimal focal necrosis of the liver in rats; erosion, inflammation, and ulceration of the glandular stomach and forestomach a in male rats; and formation ofmultiple cysts in the kidney tubules of male rats. The incidence of nephropathy was also increased in dosed female rats and mice. The maximum tolerated dose may have been exceeded in male and female rats. Neoplastic lesions associated with chlorinated paraffins (C12, 60% chlorine) administration were found in the liver of rats and mice of each sex (see table p. 12 of Technical Report) Dosed male rats showed increased incidences of kidney tubular cell hyperplasia (1/50; 9/50; 12/49) and of tubular cell adenomas (0/50; 7/50; 3/49); two low dose males had tubular cell adenocarcinomas. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were increased in dosed male rats (7/50; 12/50; 14/50) and in low dose female rats (11/50; 22/50; 16/50). Pancreatic acinar cell tumors occurred at increased incidences in low dose male rats (11/50; 22/50; 17/50). Follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) of the thyroid gland were found at increased incidences in both female rats (0/50; 6/50; 6/50) and female mice (8/50; 12/49; 15/49). Chlorinated paraffins (C12, 60% chlorine) was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley or male Syrian hamster liver S9 when tested according to the preincubational protocol.

No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of chlorinated paraffins (C12, 60&percnt; chlorine) for F344/N rats based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms (primarily neoplastic nodules) in male and female rats, of adenomas or adenocarcinomas (combined) of the kidney tubular cells in male rats, and of follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) of the thyroid gland in female rats. Mononuclear cell leukemia in dosed male rats may have been related to administration of chlorinated paraffins (C12, 60&percnt; chlorine).

These concentrations were selected because no toxicity was observed at any dose in the 14-day or 13-week studies and 50,000 ppm chemical in the diet is considered to be the highest dose to which rats and mice can be exposed for extended periods of time without reducing the nutritional value of the diet. No compound-related gross or microscopic pathologic effects were observed in the 14-day or 13-week studies. Body weights of dosed male and female rats and mice in the 2-year studies were comparable to those of the controls. Decreased survival of low dose male rats was not believed to be compound related. No other effects on survival were observed in the 2-year studies. Loss of control male mice (presumably due to fighting) was significant during the first part of the study. In the 2-year studies, nonneoplastic lesions were observed at increased incidences in rats and mice of each sex. Thrombosis and degeneration of the liver, fibrosis of the spleen, and lymphoid hyperplasia were observed in high dose male rats. Degeneration of the eye was observed in low dose female rats. Nonneoplastic lesions observed in dosed mice were granulomas in the liver of low dose males and hypertrophy in the liver of low dose and high dose males. Follicular cell hyperplasia was observed in thyroid glands of dosed male mice (control, 2/50; low dose, 10/50; high dose, 19/50). The incidences of neoplastic nodules in the liver of low and high dose male rats (1/50; 7/50; 15/49) and high dose female rats (1/50; 3/49; 9/50) were significantly greater than those in the controls. Mononuclear cell leukemia occurred in dosed male rats with a positive trend (30/50; 33/50; 35/50); this marginal increase was not considered biologically significant. Acinar cell adenomas were observed in the pancreas of four high dose male rats, and a sarcoma was observed in the spleen of one low dose and one high dose male rat. Hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) occurred at marginally increased incidences in dosed male mice (8/50; 22/50; 18/50). The incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were increased in dose male mice (0/50; 4/50; 3/50). A study of decabromodiphenyl oxide absorption from the gastrointestinal tract indicated that absorption was minimal, possibly less than 1%, at the doses administered in the 2-year studies. Additional chemical analysis indicated than the decabromodiphenyl oxide used in these studies contained several less brominated diphenyl oxides. Therefore, since absorption and toxicity of minor impurities are unknown, effects observed in these studies must be attributed to the approximately 95% pure preparation used rather than to pure decabromodiphenyl oxide. Decabromodiphenyl oxide was not mutagenic in strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, or TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced Sprague-Dawley male rat or Syrian hamster liver S9 when tested according to the preincubational protocol. Decabromodiphenyl oxide was not mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced F344/N male rat liver S9. Decabromodiphenyl oxide did not induce sister-chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro in the presence or absence of S9 prepared from livers of Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rats. An audit of experimental data was conducted for these 2-year studies on decabromodiphenyl oxide. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies of decabromodiphenyl oxide, there was some evidence of carcinogenicity for male and female F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of neoplastic nodules of the liver in low dose (25,000 ppm) males and high dose (50, and high dose (50,000 ppm) groups of each sex. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity for male B6C3F1 mice as shown by increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in the low dose group and of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in both dosed groups. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity for female B6C3F1 mice receiving 25,000 or 50,000 ppm in the diet. Several nonneoplastic lesions were observed at increased incidences, the most notable being thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia in male mice.

Tetrachloroethylene had antihelminthic uses, particularly for hookworms (1.6-8 g/60 kg), and was formerly used in combination with some grain protectants and fumigants. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of tetrachloroethylene (99.9% pure) were conducted by inhalation exposure of groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. The exposure concentrations used (0, 200, or 400 ppm for rats and 0, 100, or 200 ppm for mice) were selected on the basis of results from 13-week inhalation studies in which groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were exposed to tetrachloroethylene at 100-1,600 ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week. During the 13-week studies, 1,600 ppm tetrachloroethylene was lethal to 20%-70% of the rats and mice and reduced the final body weights of survivors. In rats, tetrachloroethylene at 200-800 ppm caused minimal to mild hepatic congestion. In dosed male and female mice, minimal to mild hepatic leukocytic infiltration, centrilobular necrosis, bile stasis (400-1,600 ppm), and mitotic alteration (200-1,600 ppm) were produced. Tetrachloroethylene exposure also caused minimal renal tubular cell karyomegaly in mice at concentrations as low as 200 ppm. During the 2-year studies, exposure to tetrachloroethylene did not consistently affect body weight gains in either rats or mice. Exposure at 400 ppm tetrachloroethylene reduced the survival of male rats (control, 23/50; low dose, 20/50; high dose, 12/50). This reduced survival may have been related to an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. Tetrachloroethylene at both exposure concentrations reduced the survival of male mice (46/50; 25/50; 32/50), whereas exposure at 200 ppm reduced female mouse survival (36/50; 31/50; 19/50). Early deaths in mice may have been related to the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. Both concentrations of tetrachloroethylene were associated with increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male rats (28/50; 37/50; 37/50). In female rats, tetrachloroethylene increased the incidence of leukemia (18/50; 30/50; 29/50) and decreased the time to occurrence of the disease. Tetrachloroethylene produced renal tubular cell karyomegaly in male and female rats, renal tubular cell hyperplasia in male rats, and renal tubular cell adenomas or adenocarcinomas (combined) in male rats (1/49; 3/49; 4/50). The incidence of the renal tubular cell tumors was not statistically significant; these uncommon tumors have been consistently found at low incidences in male rats in other 2-year studies of chlorinated ethanes and ethylenes. One low dose male rat had a kidney lipoma, and another had a nephroblastoma. Four high dose male and two high dose female rats had gliomas of the brain, whereas one control male and one control female had this tumor. In male and female mice, tetrachloroethylene caused dose-related increases in the incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. In males, tetrachloroethylene at 200 ppm increased the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas (11/49; 8/49; 18/50) and at both concentrations increased the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (7/49; 25/49; 26/50). In female mice, tetrachloroethylene at both concentrations increased the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (1/48; 13/50; 36/50). Tetrachloroethylene also produced renal tubular cell karyomegaly in both sexes of mice, and one low dose male mouse had a tubular cell adenocarcinoma. In these inhalation studies, there were no neoplastic changes in the respiratory tracts of either species, but there was an increase in the incidence of squamous metaplasia in the nasal cavities in dosed male rats (0/50; 5/50; 5/50). Tetrachloroethylene was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 in the presence or absence of male Syrian hamster or male Sprague-Dawley rat liver S9. Tetrachloroethylene was not mutagenic in was not mutagenic in L5178Y/TK&plusmn; mouse lymphoma cells with or without metabolic activation and did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. Tetrachloroethylene did not induce sister-chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for these 2-year studies on tetrachloroethylene. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of tetrachloroethylene for male F344/N rats as shown by an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia and uncommon renal tubular cell neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenicity of tetrachloroethylene for female F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity for B6C3F1 mice as shown by increased incidences of both hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in males and of hepatocellular carcinomas in females.

Benzene is also used as a solvent, but for most applications, it has been replaced by less hazardous solvents. During the 17-week studies, groups of 10 or 15 male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were gavaged 5 days per week with benzene in corn oil (5 ml/kg) at doses of 0 to 600 mg/kg. No benzene-related deaths occurred; in rats that received benzene, final mean body weights were 14%-22% lower compared with vehicle controls and in mice, slight dose-related reductions were observed (less than 10% differences). Doses for the 2-year studies were selected based on clinical observations (tremors in higher dosed mice), on clinical pathologic findings (lymphoid depletion in rats and leukopenia in mice), and on body weight effects. Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of benzene (greater than 99.7% pure) were conducted in groups of 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex and for each dose. Doses of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg body weight benzene in corn oil (5 ml/kg) were administered by gavage to male rats, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. Doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg benzene in corn oil were administered by gavage to female rats and to male and female mice for 103 weeks. Ten additional animals in each of the 16 groups were killed at 12 months and necropsies were performed. Hematologic profiles were performed at 3-month intervals. These studies were designed and conducted because of large production volume and potential human exposure, because of the epidemiologic association with leukemia, and because previous experiments were considered inadequate or inconclusive for determining potential carcinogenicity in laboratory animals. In the 2-year studies, mean body weights of the 200 mg/kg male rats (-23%) and the 100 mg/kg mice (-14% to -19%) were lower than those of the vehicle controls, and survival of dosed groups decreased with increasing dose (rats--male: vehicle control, 32/50; low dose, 29/50; mid dose, 25/50; high dose, 16/50; female: 46/50; 38/50; 34/50; 25/50; mice--male: 28/50; 23/50; 18/50; 7/50; female: 30/50; 26/50; 24/50; 18/50). At week 92 for rats and week 91 for mice, survival was greater than 60% in all groups; most of the dosed animals that died before week 103 had neoplasia. Compound-related nonneoplastic or neoplastic effects on the hematopoietic system, Zymbal gland, forestomach, and adrenal gland were found both for rats and mice. Further, the oral cavity was affected in rats, and the lung, liver, harderian gland, preputial gland, ovary, and mammary gland were affected in mice. Significantly increased (P<0.05) incidences of neoplasms were observed at multiple sites for male and female rats and for male and female mice. Primary neoplasms observed in rats and mice are summarized in Table 1 (see page 12 of the Technical Report). Hematologic data from vehicle control and dosed rats and mice were obtained at 3-month intervals from 0 to 24 months. Reliably identifiable hematologic effects were limited to lymphocytopenia and associated leukocytopenia in benzene-dosed rats and mice. These effects were seen from 3 to 18 months in dosed male rats and in dosed male mice; a similar but less pronounced response was observed in dosed female rats during this same time period. The effect in female mice was limited to 12-18 months. The technical quality of certain of these data was questionable; thus, more detailed analyses (e.g., investig questionable; thus, more detailed analyses (e.g., investigation of the association between hematologic and pathologic changes) are deemed inappropriate for these data. Benzene increased the frequency of micronucleated normchromatic peripheral erythrocytes in male and female mice (rats were not examined); males were more sensitive than females. The hematopoietic system of rats and mice of each sex was affected by benzene in the 2-year studies. The incidences of malignant lymphomas in all dosed groups of mice were greater than those in the vehicle controls (male: 4/49; 9/48; 9/50; 15/49; female: 15/49; 24/45; 24/50; 20/49). Lymphoid depletion of the splenic follicles (rats) and thymus (male rats) was observed at increased incidences. Bone marrow hematopoietic hyperplasia was observed at increased incidences in dosed mice of each sex (male: 0/49; 11/48; 10/50; 25/49; female: 3/49; 14/45; 8/50; 13/49). The incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas in mid and high dose male rats and in dosed female rats were greater than those in the vehicle controls (male: 2/32; 6/46; 10/42; 17/42; female: 0/45; 5/40; 5/44; 14/46). The incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas in mid and high dose male mice and in high dose female mice were greater than those in the vehicle controls (male: 0/43; 1/34; 4/40; 21/39; female: 0/43; 0/32; 1/37; 3/31). In mid and high dose male mice and in high dose female mice, the incidences of epithelial hyperplasia of the Zymbal gland were also increased (male: 0/43; 3/34; 12/40; 10/39; female: 1/43; 1/32; 2/37; 6/31). Hyperplasia of the adrenal capsule was observed at increased incidences in dosed mice of each sex (male: 2/47; 32/48; 14/49; 4/46; female: 5/49; 19/44; 34/50; 30/48). The incidence of pheochromocytomas in mid dose male mice was greater than that in the vehicle controls (male: 1/47; 1/48; 7/49; 1/46), whereas the incidences in dosed female mice were lower than that in the vehicle controls (female: 6/49; 1/44; 1/50; 1/48). Hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex was observed at increased incidences in low dose rats of each sex (male: 0/50; 13/49; 0/48; 2/49; female: 0/50; 17/50; 0/47; 0/49). Benzene was associated with increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin and oral cavity of rats. The incidences of squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin in high dose male rats were greater than those in the vehicle controls (squamous cell papilloma: 0/50; 2/50; 1/50; 5/50; squamous cell carcinoma: 0/50; 5/50; 3/50; 8/50). Increased incidences of uncommon squamous cell papillomas or squamous cell carcinomas (combined) of the oral cavity were observed in dosed male and female rats (male: 1/50; 9/50; 16/50; 19/50; female: 1/50; 5/50; 12/50; 9/50). Incidences of squamous cell papillomas or carcinomas (combined) (male: 2/45; 2/42; 3/44; 5/38; female: 1/42; 3/40; 6/45; 5/42), hyperkeratosis, and epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach were increased in some dosed groups of male and female mice; incidences of hyperkeratosis and acanthosis were increased in high dose male rats. Compound-related effects in the lung, harderian gland, preputial gland, ovary, mammary gland, and liver were seen in mice but not in rats. Administration of benzene was associated with increased incidences of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in mid and high dose mice (male: 2/49; 3/48; 7/50; 10/49; female: 1/49; 1/42; 9/50; 6/49). Increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were observed in high dose male mice (carcinomas: 5/49; 11/48; 12/50; 14/49; adenomas or carcinomas: 10/49; 16/48; 19/50; 21/49). Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were seen at increased incidences in high dose female mice (4/49; 2/42; 5/50; 9/49), as were alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas (0/49; 3/42; 6/50; 6/49) and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas combined (4/49; 5/42; 10/50; 13/49) in mid and high dose female mice. The incidences of focal or diffuse hyperplasia of the harderian gland were increased in dosed mice of each sex (male: 0/49; 5/46; 11/49; 7/48; female: 6/48; 10/44; 11/50; 10/47). The incidences of harderian gland adenomas (0/49; 9/46; 13/49; 11/48) in dosed male mice were greater than that in the vehicle controls. A marginal increase in the incidence of adenomas or carcinomas (combined) of the harderian gland was seen in high dose female mice (5/48; 6/44; 10/50; 10/47). The administration of benzene to male mice was associated with increased incidences of hyperplasia (1/21; 18/28; 9/29; 1/35) and squamous cell carcinomas (0/21; 3/28; 18/29; 28/35) of the preputial gland. Increased incidences of mammary gland carcinomas were found in mid dose and high dose female mice (0/49; 2/45; 5/50; 10/49) and carcinosarcomas in high dose female mice (0/49; 0/45; 1/50; 4/49). Increased incidences of various uncommon neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the ovary (papillary cystadenoma, luteoma, granulosa cell tumor, tubular adenoma, benign mixed tumor, epithelial hyperplasia, and senile atrophy) were associated with the administration of benzene to female mice. In mid and high dose female mice, the incidences of granulosa cell tumors (1/47; 1/44; 6/49; 7/48) and benign mixed tumors (0/47; 1/44; 12/49; 7/48) were greater than those in the vehicle controls. Increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas were observed in low dose female mice (1/49; 8/44; 5/50; 4/49) and hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in low dose and mid dose female mice (4/49; 12/44; 13/50; 7/49). An audit of the experimental data was conducted for these 2-year carcinogenesis studies on benzene. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of benzene for male F344/N rats, for female F344/N rats, for male B6C3F1 mice, and for female B6C3F1 mice. For male rats, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas, squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, and squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. For female rats, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas and squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. For male mice, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas, malignant lymphomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined), harderian gland adenomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the preputial gland. For female mice, benzene caused increased incidences of malignant lymphomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors, ovarian benign mixed tumors, carcinomas and carcinosarcomas of the mammary gland, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, and Zymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas. Dose-related lymphocytopenia was observed for male and female F344/N rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice.

THPS was available as a 72% aqueous solution and THPC as a 75% aqueous solution. Short-term gavage studies with a range of doses were conducted first to identify toxic effects and affected sites and to determine doses for the 2-year studies. The doses selected for the 14-day studies ranged from 12.5 to 200 mg/kg THPS for rats and mice, 9.4 to 150 mg/kg THPC for rats, and 18.8 to 300 mg/kg THPC for mice. Mortality and reduction in body weight gain occurred at the two highest doses in the 14-day studies. There was hind limb paralysis in some rats and mice dosed at the highest concentrations of THPS and THPC. In the 13-week studies, doses of THPS ranged from 5 to 60 mg/kg in rats and from 2 to 180 mg/kg in mice; doses of THPC ranged from 3.75 to 60 mg/kg in rats and from 1.5 to 135 mg/kg in mice. Mortality and reduction in body weight gain occurred at the two higher doses for both sexes and species. Vascular degeneration of hepatocytes or hepatocellular necrosis was a common histopathologic finding. Hind limb paralysis was noted in rats and mice receiving the highest dose of THPC, and axonal degeneration, characterized by swollen axon sheaths, missing or fragmented axons, and some proliferation of neurolemma cells, was observed in rats. These lesions were found in the sciatic nerve, dorsal roots of the caudal spinal nerves, and the tracts of the spinal cord, particularly in the dorsal column of the lumbar cord. Two-year studies were conducted in F344/N rats by administering 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg THPS or 0, 3.75, or 7.5 mg/kg THPC in deionized water by gavage to groups of 49 or 50 animals of each sex, 5 days per week for 103 or 104 weeks. Groups of 49 or 50 B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg THPS (each sex), 0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg THPC (males), or 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg THPC (females). Survival of male rats was reduced for the low dose (after week 102) and the high dose (after week 67) groups given THPS compared with that of the vehicle controls; survival at terminal kill was as follows: vehicle control, 28/50; low dose, 13/50; high dose, 16/50. Survival of the high dose group of female rats given THPC was lower after week 70 than that of the vehicle controls (survival at terminal kill: 37/50; 34/50; 21/50). Mean body weights of rats dosed with THPS or THPC were comparable to those of the vehicle controls. There was no difference in survival or mean body weights between the vehicle controls and mice dosed with either THPS or THPC. No neurotoxicity or any other signs of clinical toxicity were observed. A nonneoplastic effect common to 13-week and 2-year exposure to THPS or THPC was an increase in the incidence of hepatocellular lesions, primarily cytoplasmic vacuolization. The incidences of this lesion in the two-year studies were dose related for all studies except for the mice receiving THPS. Other lesions observed included focal hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla in high dose male mice given THPS and follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland in high dose female mice given THPC. The increased incidences of hematopoietic system lesions observed in these studies were not considered biologically related to chemical exposure because the increases were marginal, no dose-response relationship was observed, and the incidences of these lesions are highly variable in untreated rats and mice. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in low dose male rats administered THPS or THPC were somewhat greater than those in the vehicle controls (THPS: 30/50; 36/50; 20/50; THPC: 19/50; 25/50; 16/50). Low dose male mice administered THPS had an increased incidence of malignant lymphomas when compared with vehicle controls (2/50; 9/50; 0/50). These marginal increases in the incidences of hematopoietic system tumors were not considered related to chemical exposure, since they were signific were significant only by the life table tests and were not dose related. THPC demonstrated no mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without metabolic activation. Both THPS and THPC induced forward mutations in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells without metabolic activation; neither was tested in the presence of S9. THPC increased the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of THPS and THPC. No discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of THPS in either sex of F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice given 5 or 10 mg/kg. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity of THPC in either sex of F344/N rats given 3.75 or 7.5 mg/kg, in male B6C3F1 mice given 7.5 or 15 mg/kg, or in female B6C3F1 mice given 15 or 30 mg/kg.",,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser,National Toxicology Program technical report series,8500747,,,,,1987/02/01 00:00,2003/05/16 05:00,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser. 1987 Feb;296:1-290.,,,,,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the potential for human exposure, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of DMMPA were investigated. Fourteen-day and 13-week studies were conducted to determine short-term toxicity, to identify target organs, and to establish doses for the 2-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies. In the 14-day studies, groups of five male and five female F344/N rats were administered DMMPA in corn oil by gavage daily at 0, 313, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 mg/kg body weight for 14 consecutive days. All the rats receiving DMMPA at 2,500 or 5,000 mg/kg, except one male receiving 5,000 mg/kg, died before the end of the studies. Rats receiving DMMPA at doses of 1,250 mg/kg or less survived. The final mean body weights of the surviving dosed rats were within +/- 8% of those of the vehicle controls. Compound-related gross lesions were not found at necropsy. Groups of five B6C3F1 mice of each sex were given DMMPA by the same route on the same schedule at 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 mg/kg. All the mice given DMMPA at 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Mice administered DMMPA at doses of 1,000 mg/kg or less survived. The final mean body weight of the male mice given DMMPA at 1,000 mg/kg was 14% greater than that of the vehicle controls, whereas that of the other dosed survivors was within 10% of that of the vehicle controls. Compound-related gross lesions were not found at necropsy. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were given DMMPA by gavage in corn oil at 0, 200, 400, 1,200, or 1,600 mg/kg body weight, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. All rats given DMMPA at 400 mg/kg or less survived, and no more than 3/10 died in any of the higher dose groups. The final mean body weights of the dosed male rats were 6% to 11% greater than that of the vehicle controls; weights of the dosed female rats were similar to that of the vehicle controls (-6% to 1%). There was a dose-related increase in liver weight/body weight ratio. All the mice given DMMPA at 1,600 mg/kg, except one female, died before the end of the 13-week studies; mice receiving DMMPA at 1,200 mg/kg or less survived. The final mean body weights of the dosed male mice were 3.4% to 6.9% greater than that of the vehicle controls. The final mean body weights of dosed female mice and vehicle controls were similar. Compound-related gross or histopathologic changes were not observed in rats or mice. In the 2-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies, groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were given DMMPA in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight, 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 male B6C3F1 mice were given DMMPA at 0, 150, 300 mg/kg body weight, and groups of 50 female B6C3F1 mice were given DMMPA at 0, 300, 600 mg/kg body weight on the same schedule. Doses of 300 or 600 mg/kg were originally selected for male mice for the 2-year study; because 19/50 high dose male mice died by week 19, all male mice were killed and doses of 0, 150, and 300 mg/kg were selected for the restart of the 2-year study in male mice. The survival of high dose male (22/50) and female (24/50) rats was reduced (P<0.025) relative to that of the male (37/50) and female (36/50) vehicle controls. Mean body weights were less than 10% lower in the mid dose and high dose male rats and in the high dose female rats than in the vehicle controls. DMMPA administration did not significantly affect body weight gain or survival of male and female mice. At the 600 mg/kg dose, increased (P<0.05) incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia occurred in both male rats (vehicle control, 14/50; 150 mg/kg, 21/50; 300 mg/kg, 19/50; 600 mg/kg, 25/50) and female rats (9/50; 13/50; 12/49; 18/50). DMMPA-related neoplastic or nonneoplastic lesions were not observed in the dosed mice. DMMPA was not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA1535ns were not observed in the dosed mice. DMMPA was not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98 of Salmonella typhimurium in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rat or male Syrian hamster liver S9. DMMPA was mutagenic in the L5178Y/TK&plusmn; mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of S9; it was not tested in the presence of S9. DMMPA induced chromosomal aberrations and sister-chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of S9, but cytogenetic effects were not observed in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. An audit of the experimental data for these 2-year carcinogenesis studies on DMMPA was conducted. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenicity for male and female F344/N rats given dimethyl morpholinophosphoramidate, as indicated by increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity for male and female B6C3F1 mice given dimethyl morpholinophosphoramidate at doses of 150 (male), 300, or 600 (female) mg/kg for 2 years.

Chrysotile is the only type of asbestos in the serpentine series, whereas the amphibole series is represented by actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite, crocidolite, and tremolite. The essential characteristic of asbestos minerals is their fibrous nature. Large portions of the population ingest asbestos through consumption of food and water. Asbestos or asbestos-like fibers may gain access to water supplies as a result of mining (Lake Superior), from the presence of natural serpentine or amphibole deposits in watersheds (Seattle, WA, and San Francisco, CA) or, under certain conditions, through the use of asbestos-cement pipes for municipal water supplies. For the latter, erosion of the pipe with release of fibers is associated with the ""aggressiveness"" of the water, a term representing a mathematical expression of pH, alkalinity, and calcium content. The EPA estimated that 68.5% of water systems in the United States utilize water that is potentially capable of eroding asbestos-cement pipe. Carcinogenesis studies of amosite asbestos alone or in combination with the intestinal carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) were conducted in male and female rats. Amosite asbestos was administered at a concentration of 1% in pelleted diet for the entire lifetime of the rats, starting with the dams of the study animals. One group of amosite asbestos-exposed rats (amosite preweaning gavage) also received chrysotile asbestos via gavage during lactation. Group sizes varied from 100 to 250. Litter size was the same, but the offspring from mothers exposed to amosite asbestos were smaller at weaning than those from nonexposed mothers and remained smaller throughout their life. The DMH was administered by gavage at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg for males and 15 mg/kg for females every 14 days, starting at 8 weeks of age, for a total of five doses. The administration of DMH did not affect body weight gain either in amosite-exposed or nonexposed animals. The amosite-exposed rats showed enhanced survival compared with that of the nonexposed rats. DMH exposure reduced survival by approximately 1 year, although the survival of the amosite plus DMH groups was slightly greater than that of the DMH group alone. Significant increases in the incidences of C-cell carcinomas of the thyroid gland (untreated control, 11/117; amosite, 50/246, P<0.05; amosite preweaning gavage, 14/100) and of leukemia (38/117; 106/249, P<0.05; 49/100, P<0.01) in male rats were observed in amosite-exposed groups. However, the biologic significance of the C-cell carcinomas in relation to amosite asbestos exposure is discounted because of a lack of significance when C-cell adenomas and carcinomas were combined and because the positive effect was not observed in the amosite preweaning gavage group. The biologic significance of an increased incidence of leukemia is questionable because of a lack of statistical significance in the amosite group when evaluated by life table analysis and because no toxic lesions were observed in the target organs, i.e., gastrointestinal tract and mesothelium. DMH caused a high incidence (62%-74%) of intestinal neoplasia in amosite-exposed and nonexposed groups. Neither an enhanced carcinogenic nor a protective effect was demonstrated by exposure to amosite asbestos. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these feed studies, amosite asbestos was not overtly toxic, did not affect survival, and was not carcinogenic when ingested at a concentration of 1% in the diet by male or female F344/N rats. The cocarcinogenic studies using DMH were considered inadequate because of the high incidence of DMH-induced intestinal neoplasia in both the amosite asbestos-exposed and nonexposed groups. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Amosite Asbestos: Male Rats: Negative. Female Rats: Negative. Amosite Asbestos + DMH: Male Rats: Inadequate. Female Rats: Inadequate.

Diallylphthalate or diallylphthalate polyester blends are used primarily as plasticizers and carriers for adding catalysts and pigments to polyesters and in molding, electrical parts, laminating compounds, and impregnation of metal castings. Rubber compounds, epoxy formulations, and polyurethane foams may also contain diallylphthalate. Precise figures are not currently available, although annual production of diallylphthalate in the United States is known to exceed 5,000 pounds, and an estimated 57,000 pounds were imported into the United States in 1982. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of diallylphthalate (approximately 99% pure) were conducted by administering the test chemical in corn oil by gavage to groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats at doses of 0 (vehicle control), 50, or 100 mg/kg 5 days per week for 103 weeks. The diallylphthalate doses used in the 2-year studies were chosen on the basis of 13-week studies, wherein doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg caused death, reductions in body weight gains, or periportal hepatocellular necrosis and fibrosis in both sexes. Mean body weights and survival of male and female rats administered diallylphthalate were essentially the same as those of the vehicle controls throughout the 2-year studies, although hepatotoxicity was produced in both sexes by the 100 mg/kg dose. Based on the results of the prechronic studies and the effects on the liver in the 2-year studies, the doses used in the 2-year studies were considered to be adequate for carcinogenicity testing. Male and female rats receiving the 100 mg/kg dose of diallylphthalate in the 2-year studies developed chronic liver diseases characterized by periportal fibrosis, periportal accumulation of pigment, and severe bile duct hyperplasia. Pigment accumulation also occurred at the 50 mg/kg dose in both sexes. Diallylphthalate administration increased the occurrence of mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats (P<0.05 by trend tests), and the increase in the 100 mg/kg dose female rats was greater (P</=0.05) than in the vehicle controls by pairwise comparisons (vehicle control, 15/50, 30%; low dose, 15/43, 35%; high dose, 25/49, 51%). An increased occurrence of mononuclear cell leukemia was not observed in male rats receiving diallylphthalate. A previous NTP carcinogenesis study (NTP TR 242) reported an increased incidence of lymphomas in male B6C3F1 mice receiving diallylphthalate by gavage for 2 years at doses of 0, 150, or 300 mg/kg. This increase was considered to be equivocally related to diallylphthalate administration. The incidences of hyperplasia and inflammatory lesions of the forestomach were increased in a dose-related fashion in both sexes of mice in that study, and uncommon forestomach papillomas were observed in 0%, 2%, and 4% of both sexes of mice. Because of the numerical increase in forestomach papillomas, the concomitant presence of forestomach hyperplasia, and the rarity of forestomach papillomas in vehicle control (corn oil gavage) B6C3F1 mice, the development of these proliferative lesions of the forestomach in mice may have been related to diallylphthalate administration. In the current study in rats, a squamous cell carcinoma was found in one high dose male rat. Diallylphthalate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without activation by a 9,000 x g supernatant fraction from the livers of Aroclor 1254-treated male Sprague-Dawley rats or Syrian hamsters. Diallylphthalate did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for these carcinogenicity studies on diallylphthalate. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of this study, the administration of diallylphthalate by gavage in corn oil to male and female F344/N rats for 2 years caused chronic liver disease characterized by periportal fibrosis and pigment accumulation and an increasetal fibrosis and pigment accumulation and an increased severity of bile duct hyperplasia. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in female rats receiving 100 mg/kg. Because of the variability in the incidence of this neoplasm in aged Fisher 344 rats and the difficulty in definitively diagnosing this lesion in Fisher 344 rats, this increase was considered to be equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity of diallylphthalate in female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats.

A colorless liquid with an apple-like odor and taste, allyl isovalerate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in foods. Specific production figures are not available, but U.S. production in 1980 exceeded 1,000 pounds. Carcinogenesis studies of allyl isovalerate (96% pure) were conducted by administering the test chemical in corn oil gavage to groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and to groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice at doses of 31 or 62 mg/kg. The doses selected were based on the chemically-induced toxic effects and depressed weight gains obtained from the 13-week studies. Doses were administered five times per week for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex received corn oil by gavage on the same dosing schedule and served as vehicle controls. Survival and mean body weight gain of rats of each sex and male mice were not adversely affected by the administration of allyl isovalerate. The significantly lower survival (P=0.001) and the lower mean body weight of low-dose female as compared with controls are likely consequences of the high incidence of a genital tract infection in the low-dose females. This infection was probably responsible for the deaths of 11/19 control, 22/33 low-dose, and 13/25 high-dose female mice that died before the end of the study. Squamous cell papillomas and epithelial hyperplasia of the nonglandular stomach were observed in dosed male mice in the 2-year studies (squamous cell papillomas: 0/50, 1/50, 2%, 3/48, 6%; epithelial hyperplasia: 1/50, 2%, 1/50, 2%, 7/48, 15%). The papillomas occurred with a significant positive trend (P<0.05). The incidence of high-dose male mice with squamous cell papillomas of the nonglandular stomach was also higher (P<0.01) than the historical rate for vehicle control male B6C3F1 mice in the Bioassay Program (5/881, 0.6%). Forestomach lesions were also observed in female mice: squamous cell papillomas (1/50, 0/50, 2/50) and epithelial hyperplasia of the nonglandular stomach (0/50, 2/50, 3/50). Pancreatic acinar-cell adenomas occurred at higher incidences in the dosed male rats than in the controls (control, 1/50, 2%; low-dose, 4/50, 8%; high-dose, 2/50, 4%). Pancreatic acinar-cell tumors were not observed in female rats. Preputial gland adenomas were observed in increased incidence in low-dose male rats (0/50, 4/50, 8%; P<0.05, 1/50, 2%). Mononuclear-cell leukemias in rats and lymphomas in mice occurred with increased incidences. This consistent dose-response increase among both rats and mice indicates that allyl isovalerate adversely affects the hematopoietic system. Cholangiofibrosis, nodular regeneration, cirrhosis, focal necrosis, fatty metamorphosis, and cytoplasmic vacuolization were observed at increased incidences in the livers of high-dose male and female rats in the 2-year study. No compound-related nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the mice of either sex. Liver neoplasms were not increased in either dosed rats or mice of either sex. Significant (P<0.05) decreases in tumor incidences were observed in male mice for hepatocellular carcinomas (18/50, 6/50, 9/50), for alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (13/50, 6/50, 5/49), and for follicular-cell adenomas of the thyroid gland (5/47, 0/46, 1/49). Allyl isovalerate was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium (tester strains TA 98, 100, 1535, and 1537) with or without metabolic activation. Under the conditions of these studies, allyl isovalerate was carcinogenic for F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice, causing increased incidences of hematopoietic system neoplasms (mononuclear-cell leukemia in male rats and lymphoma in female mice).

Survivors then were fed a control diet for 1 week, killed, and examined. Throughout most of the studies, mean body weights of dosed rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of the controls. Survival rates of low dose female rats and high dose male and female mice were increased relative to those of the controls. In 13-week toxicity studies, the lympho/hematopoietic system of rats and mice was the primary site affected. The lymphoid depletion found in these animals was not seen in rats or mice surviving to the end of the 104-week studies. Nonneoplastic changes associated with the long-term administration of monuron to rats included renal tubular cell cytomegaly, mainly involving the proximal convoluted tubules in male and female rats, and dose-related hepatic cytoplasmic changes in male rats. In the 104-week study, the kidneys and liver of male rats were the primary tissues affected. Long-term administration of monuron was associated with an increase in renal tubular cell adenomas (control, 0/50; low dose, 2/50; high dose, 7/50) and renal tubular cell adenocarcinomas (0/50; 1/50; 8/50). Administration of monuron to male rats was associated with increased incidences of neoplastic nodules of the liver (1/50; 6/49; 7/50) and of neoplastic nodules or carcinomas (combined) of the liver (1/50; 6/49; 9/50). Dosed male and female rats had decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia; dosed male rats had lower incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal glands and C-cell carcinomas of the thyroid gland; dosed female rats had reduced incidences of mammary gland fibroadenomas. In male mice, dose-related decreases occurred in the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (6/50; 5/49; 2/50) and hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (12/50; 8/49; 6/50); incidences of hepatocellular tumors in low dose female mice were reduced in dosed female mice (16/50; 8/50; 7/50). Monuron was not mutagenic in Salmonella strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Monuron did induce chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. The data, documents and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of monuron have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity for male F344/N rats in that monuron caused increased incidences of tubular cell adenocarcinomas of the kidney, tubular cell adenomas of the kidney, and neoplastic nodules or carcinomas (combined) of the liver. Monuron induced cytomegaly of the renal tubular epithelial cells in both male and female F344/N rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity for female F344/N rats or for male or female B6C3F1 mice.

We sought to evaluate the results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in this situation. From 1992 to 2000, 121 patients with Ph- positive ALL enrolled in one of the three main French prospective ALL chemotherapy trials and receiving allogeneic HSCT were reported to the registry of the French Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation (SFGM-TC). The median age was 35 years (range, 1-53). In all, 76 patients received HSCT in first complete remission and 45 in a more advanced disease stage. Minimal residual disease was evaluated just before the graft: 35 patients of the 52 patients in first remission had persistent BCR-ABL transcript detectable while 17 had no detectable minimal residual disease. Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples from 94 patients were submitted for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis at variable points after transplantation. Estimated 2-year survival and relapse rate for patients in CR1 were 50 and 37%, respectively, significantly better than for patients with more advanced disease (P=0.0001 and 0.01, respectively). There was no difference in survival or in relapse rates in terms of the donor used. Relapse was the most common cause of treatment failure. Hematological status at the time of transplant and the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were the only two prognostic factors identified for relapse (P=0.02 and 0.02, respectively). Detection of BCR-ABL transcripts after transplantation had a predictive value on relapse occurrence. Finally, donor lymphocyte infusions were successfully used to treat some relapses. The graft-versus-leukemia effect of HSCT in Ph-positive ALL appears to be supported by (1) the lack of prognostic significance of pretransplant BCR-ABL transcript detection, (2) the efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusions in cases of relapse, and (3) the role of GvHD as protecting against relapse.","['Esperou, H', 'Boiron, J-M', 'Cayuela, J-M', 'Blanchet, O', 'Kuentz, M', 'Jouet, J-P', 'Milpied, N', 'Cahn, J-Y', 'Faucher, C', 'Bourhis, J-H', 'Michallet, M', 'Tanguy, M-L', 'Vernant, J-P', 'Gabert, J', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Ifrah, N', 'Baruchel, A', 'Dombret, H']","['Esperou H', 'Boiron JM', 'Cayuela JM', 'Blanchet O', 'Kuentz M', 'Jouet JP', 'Milpied N', 'Cahn JY', 'Faucher C', 'Bourhis JH', 'Michallet M', 'Tanguy ML', 'Vernant JP', 'Gabert J', 'Bordigoni P', 'Ifrah N', 'Baruchel A', 'Dombret H']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/epidemiology', 'Societies, Medical', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/16 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/05/16 05:00'],"['2003/05/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703951 [doi]', '1703951 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 May;31(10):909-18. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703951.,,,,,['French Bone Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,,

In nine of these 12 patients, cGMP level decreased during the recovery phase. Eight of the nine patients survived, one dying after relapse. In three other patients, the cGMP level continued to increase even during the recovery phase and they died of severe complications. cGMP became positive on day 0 of BMT and during the leukocyte recovery phase after BMT in two and seven of the 23 patients, respectively. Subsequently, all patients died of severe complications. The two patients who were negative for cGMP both before and after BMT survived without complications. These results suggest that monitoring cGMP from early after BMT may be useful for predicting outcome and that it may be a useful prognostic marker.","['Takatsuka, H', 'Wakae, T', 'Mori, A', 'Okada, M', 'Fujimori, Y', 'Okamoto, T', 'Kakishita, E', 'Hara, H']","['Takatsuka H', 'Wakae T', 'Mori A', 'Okada M', 'Fujimori Y', 'Okamoto T', 'Kakishita E', 'Hara H']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blast Crisis/surgery', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclic GMP/*blood', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/surgery', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",,2003/05/16 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/05/16 05:00'],"['2003/05/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703956 [doi]', '1703956 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 May;31(10):905-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703956.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient characteristics in both groups were similar. More hematological responders were present in the IFN(+) patients (P=0.0001). No difference was found in engraftment kinetics. The incidences of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and graft failure were similar in all patients regardless of stem cell source. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years were similar for both IFN(+) or (-) patients following SCT.

Patients underwent T-cell-depleted PMRDT (n=164) or ABMT (n=131) for acute myeloid leukemia (n=130) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=165). Fewer PMRDT patients were in remission (29 vs 85%; P<0.0001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 52% after PMRDT and 16% after ABMT (P<0.0001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 32% after PMRDT and 54% after ABMT (P=0.006). The actuarial unadjusted 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 16% after PMRDT and 30% after ABMT. In Cox's regression analysis, PMRDT (P<0.0001) and age >15 years (P=0.002) were associated with higher TRM, active disease (P=0.0021), ABMT (P=0.0074) and male sex (P=0.011) with higher relapse, and age >15 years (P=0.0007) and PMRDT (P=0.047) with lower DFS. Amongst second remission patients, TRM was higher after PMRDT (P=0.0003), relapse was higher after ABMT (P=0.034), and 5-year DFS was comparable (32% ABMT and 25% PMRDT). ABMT, if feasible, may be preferable to PMRDT in advanced acute leukemia patients since lower relapse after PMRDT is offset by higher TRM. If an autograft is not feasible because of nonavailability of autologous cells or very advanced disease, PMRDT is a potential alternative.","['Singhal, S', 'Henslee-Downey, P J', 'Powles, R', 'Chiang, K Y', 'Godder, K', 'Treleaven, J', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Van Rhee, F', 'Sirohi, B', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Meller, S', 'Jovanovic, B', 'Mehta, J']","['Singhal S', 'Henslee-Downey PJ', 'Powles R', 'Chiang KY', 'Godder K', 'Treleaven J', 'Kulkarni S', 'Van Rhee F', 'Sirohi B', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Meller S', 'Jovanovic B', 'Mehta J']","['Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2003/05/16 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/05/16 05:00'],"['2003/05/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704031 [doi]', '1704031 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 May;31(10):889-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, 97 patients alive and disease-free for at least 100 days after transplant were selected for the purpose of this long-term analysis. The use of an intensified conditioning regimen, Gram-negative bacteriaemia before transplantation, year of transplantation and number of pretransplant chemotherapy courses for patients in CR1 significantly affected the 7-year event-free survival which was 57%. 7-year transplant-related mortality TRM was 22%. Significant predictors for TRM were: bacterial infections before transplantation, major ABO blood group incompatibility, late severe bacterial infections, and chronic (graft-versus-host disease) GvHD. Predictive factors for late severe bacterial infections were infections before transplant, total body irradiation and GvHD. Incidence and risk factors for other late events including, chronic GvHD, late infections, osteonecrosis, cataract, endocrine- cardiac- and lung-complications, cancer and performance status at last follow-up were also studied.

We wish to identify additional human cancers expressing CTRs and assay the effects of CT on their growth rates and signal transduction pathways. RESULTS: The expression of the human calcitonin receptor (hCTR) gene in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 was examined. RT-PCR on total RNA extracted from K562 cells detected the presence of hCTR mRNA. Further analysis demonstrated that multiple hCTR isoforms were present. Incubation of K562 cells with salmon calcitonin (sCT), but not amylin, caused an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP similar to that induced by forskolin treatment. We further demonstrated that butyrate induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells caused a significant decrease in hCTR mRNA levels. However, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced megakaryocytic differentiation of these cells had no significant effect on hCTR mRNA levels. We demonstrated that exposure to various concentrations of sCT had no effect on the cellular proliferation of K562 cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: Chronic myelogenous k562 cells express multiple CTR isoforms. However, CT does not effect K562 proliferation rates. It is likely that the small increase in intracellular levels of cAMP following CT treatment is not sufficient to interfere with cellular growth.","['Mould, Richard', 'Pondel, Marc D']","['Mould R', 'Pondel MD']","[""St, George's Hospital Medical School Dept, of Cellular Pathology London, SW17 ORE, United Kingdom. mpondel@sghms.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,,2003/05/16 05:00,2003/05/16 05:01,['2003/05/16 05:00'],"['2003/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/16 05:01 [medline]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1475-2867-3-6 [doi]'],epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2003 Apr 25;3(1):6. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-3-6.,,20030425,,,,,,,PMC155681,,,,,,,

The ODN transporting capacity of novel compounds was dependent on the magnitude and the nature of their positive charges as well as on the porphyrin/ODN molar ratio. Porphyrin-ODN complexes were internalized into cells, and their dissociation was demonstrated by accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-ODN fluorescence in the nucleus. Importantly, porphyrin 3 significantly protected complexed ODN against degradation and efficiently mediated the specific antisense effect on targeted v-Myb expression, resulting in reproducible growth inhibition of treated cells.

Combining large and small scale ELISPOT assays for expression cloning has the following advantages compared to conventional cDNA expression cloning: i) the number of recombinant plasmids which can be screened is greater than 10,000 per well in a 24-well plate in a large scale ELISPOT assay compared to fewer than 100 per well in a 96-well plate in an IFN-gamma ELISA or a TNF-alpha bioassay; ii) the total number of recombinant plasmids which can be screened in a routine assay is 2 x 10 (5) in only one 24-well plate in a large scale ELISPOT assay compared to 1 x 10 (5) in ten 96-well plates in an IFN-gamma ELISA or a TNF-alpha bioassay. Thus the screening efficiency of large scale ELISPOT cloning is approximately 200 times that of conventional expression cloning approaches.

As a mechanism to evade T cell recognition, many malignant cancer cells, including those of prostate cancer, down-regulate MHC class I. For the majority of human cancers, the molecular mechanism of MHC class I down regulation is unclear, although it is well established that MHC class I down-regulation is often associated with the down-regulation of multiple genes devoted to antigen presentation. Since the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proto-oncogene controls multiple antigen-presentation genes in some murine cancer cells, we analyzed the expression of proto-oncogene PML and MHC class I in high-grade prostate cancer. We found that 30 of 37 (81%) prostate adenocarcinoma cases with a Gleason grade of 7-8 had more than 50% down-regulation of HLA class I expression. Among these, 22 cases (73.3%) had no detectable PML protein, while 4 cases (13.3%) showed partial PML down-regulation. In contrast, all 7 cases of prostate cancer with high expression of cell surface HLA class I had high levels of PML expression. Concordant down-regulation of HLA and PML was observed in different histological patterns of prostate adenocarcinoma. These results suggest that in high-grade prostate cancer, malfunction of proto-oncogene PML is a major factor in the down-regulation of cell surface HLA class I molecules, the target molecules essential for the direct recognition of cancer cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes.","['Zhang, Huiming', 'Melamed, Jonathan', 'Wei, Ping', 'Cox, Karen', 'Frankel, Wendy', 'Bahnson, Robert R', 'Robinson, Nikki', 'Pyka, Ron', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zheng, Pan']","['Zhang H', 'Melamed J', 'Wei P', 'Cox K', 'Frankel W', 'Bahnson RR', 'Robinson N', 'Pyka R', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng P']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Cancer Immunology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Immun,Cancer immunity,101119871,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/05/16 05:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2003/05/16 05:00'],"['2002/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['030102 [pii]'],epublish,Cancer Immun. 2003 Feb 14;3:2.,,20030214,['CA82355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

All nuclides except 244Cm showed activities above the detection limit in the Elbmarsch samples and an elevated mean concentration compared to the control. It can be concluded from the activity ratio 241Am/(239,240)Pu that the Elbmarsch contamination cannot be accounted for by the background levels of transuranic nuclides resulting from weapons fallout.

METHODS: The patient was referred to the periodontology department with a 4-week history of gingival enlargement and loosening of teeth. The clinical examination revealed gingival enlargement and expansion of alveolar mucosa particularly in molar regions of both jaws. Almost all teeth had deep periodontal pockets and severe mobility. While the radiographs showed severe alveolar bone loss which extended to apical thirds of many teeth, the microbiologic analysis revealed that the patient did not harbor major periodontopathogenic bacteria species. The results of blood tests and bone marrow aspiration were compatible with ALL-L3. RESULTS: Remission-induction treatment with BFM-90 ALL chemotherapy protocol was started; however, the patient died 4 weeks after the diagnosis due to neutropenic sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although no biopsy was performed, it is possible that the severe periodontal destruction and gingival enlargement in this case may have been due to the infiltration of leukemic cells in gingiva, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.

Expression of RT-coding genes is generally repressed in differentiated nonpathological tissues, yet is active in the mammalian germ line, embryonic tissues and tumor cells. Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor with a well-characterized inhibitory activity on RT enzymes of retroviral origin. Here, we show that nevirapine is also an effective inhibitor of the endogenous RT in murine and human cell lines. In addition, progenitor and transformed cells undergo a significant reduction in the rate of cell growth upon exposure to nevirapine. This is accompanied by the onset of differentiation, as depicted in F9 and C2C7 progenitor cells cultures in which nevirapine triggers the expression of differentiation-specific markers. Consistent with this, an extensive reprogramming of cell cycle gene expression was depicted in nevirapine-treated F9 cultures. Furthermore, nevirapine exposure rescued the differentiation block present in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary blasts from two AML patients, as indicated by morphological, functional and immunophenotypic assays.

Since diagnostic criteria for DIC were established by the study group on thrombosis and hemostasis which is supported by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare(JMHW), serum FDP assay have been used as standard methods to diagnose DIC in Japan. Recently, a reagent using an anti-human FDP monoclonal antibody was developed and this has enabled the use of plasma samples for FDP measurement. The comparability, especially of the DIC score, of a new assay, Latex test BL-2 P-FDP, using plasma samples with a conventional assay for serum was investigated. Two sets of DIC scores based on data from the two tests were compared and the correlation was high with 97.5% of the patients being diagnosed with the same DIC status. In four disease groups--DIC, thrombosis, leukemia and solid cancer--high comparability between the two tests was also shown and no significant difference was observed in the correlation coefficient and the slope coefficient between serum and plasma samples.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for malignancy among HIV-infected children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multicenter case-control study of children with HIV at 26 institutions participating in the Pediatric Oncology Group. Forty-three case patients with a new malignancy and 74 control patients without a malignancy were matched based on the duration of their infection. Patients were enrolled between January 1992 and July 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and laboratory factors assessed as putative risk factors included demographic characteristics, HIV characteristics, prior antiretroviral treatment, and CD4 cell count. Coviral infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 were assessed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assays and serological testing. RESULTS: Case malignancy diagnoses included 28 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 4 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 Hodgkin disease, 8 leiomyosarcoma, 1 hepatoblastoma, and 1 schwannoma. Epstein-Barr virus viral load of more than 50 viral genome copies per 105 peripheral blood mononuclear cells was strongly associated with cancer risk but only for children with CD4 cell counts of at least 200/ microL (odds ratio [OR], 11.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-65.66, P<.001). High EBV viral load was not associated with cancer for children with CD4 cell counts of less than 200/ microL (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.13-9.62; P =.99). Zidovudine antiretroviral therapy did not confer a significant protective effect for either the high (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.22-3.09; P =.77) or the low CD4 cell count groups (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.04-1.46; P =.16). The route of HIV infection was not associated with increased cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Route of infection, demographic characteristics, and zidovudine use were not associated with the development of malignancy in HIV-infected children. High viral burden with EBV was associated with the development of malignancy in HIV-infected children although the effect was modified by CD4 cell count. The pathogenesis of HIV-related pediatric malignancies remains unclear and other contributing risk factors can be elucidated only through further study.","['Pollock, Brad H', 'Jenson, Hal B', 'Leach, Charles T', 'McClain, Kenneth L', 'Hutchison, Robert E', 'Garzarella, Linda', 'Joshi, Vijay V', 'Parmley, Richard T', 'Murphy, Sharon B']","['Pollock BH', 'Jenson HB', 'Leach CT', 'McClain KL', 'Hutchison RE', 'Garzarella L', 'Joshi VV', 'Parmley RT', 'Murphy SB']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Center for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX 78229-3900, USA. bpollock@uthscsa.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/complications/virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/blood/*complications/virology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/immunology/virology', 'Hepatoblastoma/complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leiomyosarcoma/complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neurilemmoma/complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Roseolovirus Infections/blood/complications/virology', 'Viral Load']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/05/24 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1001/jama.289.18.2393 [doi]', '289/18/2393 [pii]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2003 May 14;289(18):2393-9. doi: 10.1001/jama.289.18.2393.,,,"['CA07431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is encountered in immunocompromised hosts exemplified by those with diabetes, human immunodeficiency viruses and particularly haematologic malignancies typically after high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. In contrast to the more usual outcome with rapid progression and death. We now describe a successful eradication attributable to the use of a newly available antifungal agent. SETTING: Haematology department and bone marrow transplantation unit. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Two patients are contrasted. The first with acute leukaemia developed rapidly progressive facial swelling with mucormycosis proven on biopsy. Treatment over 2 months with maximally tolerated doses of amphotericin failed to halt intracranial extension and death resulted. The second, presented with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in August 1997, underwent successful autologous bone marrow transplantation in February 1998. Relapse followed in March 1999 and after reinduction and consolidation receive a matched unrelated volunteer allograft in September 1999. A second recurrence was documented in April 2000 and in spite of achieving remission he developed a fever that was managed empirically with intravenous amphotericin and, on discharge, oral itraconazole. Left-sided facial swelling expanded rapidly and biopsy showed extensive invasion of the maxillary sinus with mucormycosis. FK463 was added on 5 June 2000 with gradual reduction in facial pain and within 1 month all clinical signs and resolved. Serial biopsies that included histopathologic investigation and microbiologic cultures confirmed eradication of the invasive mucor. In view of the potential danger of recrudescence this treatment regimen was continued through further chemotherapy and, once again disease-free, a second matched unrelated volunteer allograft took place in August 2000. Full reassessment at the time failed to demonstration any residual fungus. Engraftment was confirmed but neutropenic sepsis resulted in severe inflammatory response syndrome with progression to multiple organ dysfunction to which he succumbed without any evidence of leukaemic or systemic mycosis. CONCLUSION: Echinocandin FK463 is of documented value in managing invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis. This is believed to be the first case of successful outcome with one of the angiotrophic zygomycetes.","['Jacobs, Peter', 'Wood, Lucille', 'Du Toit, Andrew', 'Esterhuizen, Ken']","['Jacobs P', 'Wood L', 'Du Toit A', 'Esterhuizen K']","['The Department of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit Incorporation the Searll Research Laboratory for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Costantiaberg Medi-Clinic, Burnham Road, Plumstead, Cape Town, 7800, South Africa. haematol@icon.co.za']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Echinocandins', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/drug therapy/surgery', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lipoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Mucormycosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Periodontal Abscess/complications/microbiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Sinusitis/complications/microbiology', 'Splenectomy', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1024533031000090810 [doi]', 'JTK5WN21WRDQFNC1 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2003 Apr;8(2):119-23. doi: 10.1080/1024533031000090810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level, it is associated with a disease-specific fusion gene, CBFbeta/MYH11. Previously, 10 different types of CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts have been described in the literature, 7 of them are still known as unique cases. In the current study, peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples from 265 AML patients were tested for the presence of the CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion using RT-PCR and 12 (4.5%) positive cases were identified. The most common type A CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript was confirmed in 11 patients.

Harvest quality was the main factor precluding APBSCT. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients who achieved CR was 38% and in APBSCT patients was 57%. There were no transplant-related deaths. No significant differences were demonstrated between observed and expected outcomes at 1 and 2 years, based on the predictive model derived from the MRC AML10 study.

Analysis of the TCR rearrangement has been routinely used to detect clonality for the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies. However, molecular analysis of the TCR repertoire can be a powerful tool in the study of T-cell responses to pathogens and in autoimmune diseases. The concept of the oligoclonality in the context of cellular immune responses is based on the presence of immunodominant T-cell clones within distinct T-cell subpopulations used for analysis. Under normal circumstances, a limited number of clones undergo periodic expansions in reaction to foreign antigens. Under pathologic conditions, though, the derailment of immune regulation allows expansions of specific and potentially pathogenic T-cell clones. For example, large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia illustrates an extreme expansion of a single T-cell clone associated with a distinct autoimmune pathology, which suggests an exaggerated clonal response to a specific antigenic target. In immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndromes, clonal rearrangement of the TCR cannot be detected in unseparated blood or marrow. Nevertheless, individual T-cell clones can significantly expand and may allow for demonstration of oligoclonality in selected T-cell populations. These subpopulations are defined, for example, by a specific beta (B)-chain usage or other phenotypic markers. Given the diversity of the TCR recognition spectrum, the task of identifying immunodominant clonotypes derived from unique complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) sequences is very complex. However, expanded T-cell clones likely represent immunodominant responses which can be detected on the molecular level using analysis of the individual TCR VB-chain representation, CDR3 size fragment skewing, and determination of the frequency of individual clonotypic sequences. In the future, TCR VB clonotypes may be applied as a diagnostic tool, analogous to serologic markers. As an investigative tool in hematology, molecular analysis of the TCR utilization pattern and the detection of immunodominant clonotypes represents a novel approach in the study of immune-mediated hematologic diseases, such as aplastic anemia (AA), some forms of myelodysplasia (MDS), anti-leukemic immune surveillance, graft-versus-leukemia effects and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).","['Plasilova, Magdalena', 'Risitano, Antonio', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Plasilova M', 'Risitano A', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, R40, USA. maciejj@cc.ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Forecasting', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",79,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/09/03 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1024533031000107505 [doi]', 'LU6GQ38XG20M1P6T [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2003 Jun;8(3):173-81. doi: 10.1080/1024533031000107505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review will focus on the mosaic proof and examine possible pathogenic mechanisms.

It is characterized by the expansion of the myeloid lineage, which results in the accumulation of mature and immature granulocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow. However, when CML marrow cells are cultured in Dexter-type long-term cultures (LTMC) hematopoiesis is defective and can be sustained for only a few weeks. One possible explanation for the deficient growth of hematopoietic cells in CML LTMC is that some factors that act as key regulators of hematopoiesis are absent in this experimental system. Thus, we tested this hypothesis by adding recombinant cytokines to these cultures. As a first approach, we added recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), rhGranulocyte-CSF (rhG-CSF) and rhErythropoietin (rhEPO); each factor was added individually once a week. Addition of rhGM-CSF and rhG-CSF resulted in a significant increase in the levels of nucleated cells and myeloid progenitors; the highest effects were seen in the presence of rhGM-CSF. Interestingly, such a cytokine also induced a significant decrease in the levels of erythroid progenitors. Recombinant hEPO had no significant effects on nucleated cells or myeloid progenitors, however, it induced a significant, although transient, increase in the levels of erythroid cells. The above results indicate that the hematopoietic regulators used here (rhGM-CSF, rhG-CSF and rhEPO) are capable of stimulating the growth of hematopoietic cells in LTMC from CML patients. Thus, this study demonstrates that it is, indeed, possible to manipulate CML LTMC by the addition of recombinant cytokines; this observation may be of particular relevance, since this in vitro experimental system has already been used as a method for purging of leukemic cells in autologous transplant settings. By using specific recombinant hematopoietic modulators it might be possible to make LTMC a more efficient system for such a clinical purpose.","['Luna-Bautista, Fernando', 'Sanchez-Valle, Elizabeth', 'Ayala-Sanchez, Manuel', 'Morales-Polanco, Manuel', 'Meillon-Garcia, Luis', 'Benitez-Bribiesca, Luis', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Luna-Bautista F', 'Sanchez-Valle E', 'Ayala-Sanchez M', 'Morales-Polanco M', 'Meillon-Garcia L', 'Benitez-Bribiesca L', 'Mayani H']","['Oncological Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Nationa Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Lineage', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/09/03 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1024533031000112248 [doi]', 'C8EJFPBVHWH2EFFF [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2003 Jun;8(3):155-63. doi: 10.1080/1024533031000112248.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: For those receiving PBSC (n = 28), mobilization protocol was with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg followed by G-CSF injection at 5-10 microg/kg; stem cells were harvested by large volume apheresis (6-8 blood volumes) and then cryopreserved. Ablative therapy consisted of fractionated TBI (total 12 Gy), followed by four fractions (1.5 Gy each) of total nodal irradiation (TNI), and CY 120 mg/kg under mesna cover. RESULTS: For individuals transplanted in CR 1 (n = 31) the median time from diagnosis to grafting was 167 (range 92 - 212) days. Patients transplanted with PBSC received high number of CFU-GM x 10(4)/kg (P < 0.01), a difference that was associated with a significantly shorter platelet recovery. While there was no early transplant-associated mortality, in 10 patients death was caused by recurrence of the disease. The median survival is 1746 (range 105-4467) days and 26 (70%) survive disease free, at a median 2207 (range 698-4467) days from transplantation. Multivariate analysis showed that survival of patients with AML-M3, receiving higher CFU-GM (P = 0.04) and without morphological dysplasia (P = 0.01) was longest. DISCUSSION: For patients in remission of AML, transplantation with PBPC appears to be an effective form of intensification, particularly when TBI + TNI (delivering a total of 18 Gy to the axial skeleton) were used as conditioning.","['Novitzky, N', 'Thomas, V', 'Stubbings, H']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomas V', 'Stubbings H']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cape Town Medical School, Cape Town, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/14653240310001037 [doi]', 'VQVTQ038T71YK0LJ [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2003;5(2):139-46. doi: 10.1080/14653240310001037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GC-dependent inhibition of NF-kappaB may occur at different levels, but the mechanisms involved are still incompletely understood. In this work, we investigated whether the synthetic GC, dexamethasone (Dex), modulates the activity of NF-kappaB in the lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM cell line. We also evaluated the ability of Dex to prevent the activation of NF-kappaB in response to the potent proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1beta. RESULTS: Exposure of the cells to Dex (1 microM) induced the rapid degradation of IkappaB-alpha, leading to the transient translocation of the NF-kappaB family members p65 and p50 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, as evaluated by western blot. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that, in the nucleus, these NF-kappaB proteins formed protein-DNA complexes, indicating a transient activation of NF-kappaB. Additionally, Dex also induced de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha, following its degradation. Finally, when the cells were exposed to Dex (1 microM) prior to stimulation with IL-1beta (20 ng/ml), Dex was efficient in preventing IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activation. The GC antagonist, RU 486 (10 microM), did not prevent any of the effects of Dex reported here. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that, in CCRF-CEM cells, Dex prevents NF-kappaB activation, induced by IL-1beta, by a mechanism that involves the upregulation of IkappaB-alpha synthesis, and that depends on the early and transient activation of NF-kappaB.","['Castro-Caldas, M', 'Mendes, A F', 'Carvalho, A P', 'Duarte, C B', 'Lopes, M C']","['Castro-Caldas M', 'Mendes AF', 'Carvalho AP', 'Duarte CB', 'Lopes MC']","['Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Department of Zoology, University of Coimbra, 3004-517 Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor RelB', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/0962935031000096953 [doi]', '2RXJRAD6FKWNQ940 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2003 Feb;12(1):37-46. doi: 10.1080/0962935031000096953.,,,,,,,,,PMC1781587,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bone marrow at the time of diagnosis was positive for both BCL-2/JH and CDRIII rearrangements. After treatment, the patient achieved complete remission (CR) with slow disappearance of both rearrangements (CDRIII and then BCL-2/JH). Subsequently, two new CDRIII rearrangements were detected in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymph node tissue. After this conversion, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated monoclonal disease, suggesting that both CDRIII rearrangements originated from one cell. Histological evidence of a B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma (B-SLL) infiltrate in the bone marrow became evident approximately 1 year after the two CDRIII rearrangements appeared. Direct sequencing revealed that one of the CDRIII sequences consisted of a VDVDJ rearrangement. This is the first report of such a rearrangement in a case of indolent lymphoma. This type of rearrangement has been described to result from a secondary VDJ recombination in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) leading towards oligoclonality and poorer prognosis. Our observations suggest that such a finding in an indolent lymphoma patient may precede transformation into an aggressive disease.

We sought to analyze the results of reduced intensity conditioning for allografts in adult patients with ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the results of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 27 adult patients with high-risk ALL who were included in four prospective studies. RESULTS: The median age was 50 years; 23 (85%) patients were beyond first complete remission, 44% were chemorefractory and 41% were Philadelphia chromosome positive. Donors were mismatched related donors or volunteer unrelated donors in 12 cases (44%). The incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 48%, and 13 of 18 evaluable patients (72%) developed chronic GVHD. Currently nine patients are alive, with a median follow-up of 809 days (range, 381-1375). The 2-year incidence of transplant-related mortality was 23% (95% CI, 11% to 46%), and the 2-year probability of overall survival was 31% (95% CI, 12 to 48%), while the 2-year incidence of disease progression was 49% (95% CI, 33% to 72%). The 2-year incidence of disease progression in patients with and without GVHD was 35% (95% CI, 19% to 57%) and 70% (95% CI, 47% to 100%), respectively (p=0.05). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study suggests that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning might be a useful therapeutic option for some patients with ALL who are ineligible for standard myeloablative conditioning. However, this treatment modality needs to be evaluated in prospective trials, and should not be employed outside clinical studies.","['Martino, Rodrigo', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Caballero, Maria Dolores', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Corradini, Paolo', 'Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'San Miguel, Jesus', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Martino R', 'Giralt S', 'Caballero MD', 'Mackinnon S', 'Corradini P', 'Fernandez-Aviles F', 'San Miguel J', 'Sierra J']","['Division of Clinical Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Av.

This is particularly relevant in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, where the graft-versus-leukemia effect acts on cells pretreated with cytostatic drugs. Here, we clarify the mechanism underlying cross-resistance of drug-resistant variants of the T-leukemia cell line CEM towards natural killer cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the sensitivity of different CEM sublines to natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity, and separately analyzed the components of the killing machinery by detection of granzyme B-induced caspase cleavage and HLA class I-dependent recognition mechanisms. Furthermore, we studied regulation of HLA class I expression comparing CEM with other cell lines. RESULTS: We found that CEM cells resistant to cytostatic drugs or CD95 were cross-resistant towards NK cells from a variety of donors. Granzyme B-induced caspase and PARP cleavage in the sensitive and resistant cells were comparable, indicating that downstream apoptosis pathways were not altered in the drug-resistant cells. HLA class I molecules were upregulated in the resistant cells, inhibiting NK cells at the level of killer/target recognition. HLA class I upregulation was not found in other leukemia cell lines. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of HLA class I-mediated NK cross-resistance in drug-resistant cells. This finding may have a clinical impact since it may be considered as a possible reason for resistance to a graft-versus-leukemia approach in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation","['Classen, Carl Friedrich', 'Falk, Christine S', 'Friesen, Claudia', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Herr, Ingrid', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael']","['Classen CF', 'Falk CS', 'Friesen C', 'Fulda S', 'Herr I', 'Debatin KM']","[""University Children's Hospital Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 43, D-89070 Ulm, Germany. carl.classen@medizin.uni-ulm.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Granzymes', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lysosomes/physiology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 May;88(5):509-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression levels of apoptosis regulatory proteins and spontaneous apoptosis were measured in primary AML samples by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. To determine the role of CD34+ cells in apoptosis resistance, spontaneous apoptosis in serum-free conditions and apoptosis regulatory protein levels were measured in CD34+ and CD34- sorted cells from CD34+ primary AML samples. RESULTS: We show that CD34+ AML fractions are more resistant to apoptosis than are corresponding CD34- AML fractions, and that this is paralleled by higher Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Pgp and lower Bax expression levels. Interestingly, as the percentage of CD34 cells increased in the primary AML sample, so too did the apoptosis resistance in the corresponding CD34- fraction, which was reflected by an increasing anti-apoptosis protein profile.

A high frequency of abnormalities in FHIT gene has been demonstrated in various cancers. FHIT is proposed as a putative tumor-suppressor gene. To evaluate the expression of the FHIT gene in various leukemias, bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 98 leukemia patients were tested by RT-PCR: 38 from patients with AML-[M(2)(9), M(3)(12), M(4)(8), M(5)(9)], 16 with ALL, and 34 with CML-[CP(20), AP(4), BC(10)] of various FAB types, as well as 10 patients with other hematological malignancies. To detect a deletion in sequencing the FHIT gene, the representative aberrant PCR products were cloned and then sequenced. The results showed that 22/38 (58%) patients with AML, 9/16 (56%) patients with ALL and 19/34 (56%) patients with CML were detectable of aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts or deletion of FHIT. In 6 (16%) AML patients, 3 (19%) ALL patients, and 5 (15%) CML patients, the wild-type product was absent. Some patient's samples - 6 (42%) AML, 6 (38%) ALL, and 14 (41%) CML revealed aberrant FHIT transcripts in addition to a normal-sized band. Samples from healthy donors (PB, n = 12; BM, n = 5) did not indicate any abnormal expression. Eleven isolated fragments from various patterns of FHIT gene expression were investigated using cDNA sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed deletion of exon 4-8, exon 5-8, and exon 5-6 in various leukemias, as well as the deletion of the full FHIT gene sequence. The fused transcripts included: exon 3 and exon 9, exon 3 and exon 7, exon 4 and exon 9, exon 5 and exon 7. Sequence analysis of aberrant fragments present in samples from an AML and a CML patients was detected for point mutations and insert mutations located in exons 2, 8 and 10, plus a variety of aberrant transcripts. Deletion or aberrant FHIT mRNA transcripts in 50/98 (51%) leukemia patients were found. All samples with aberrant FHIT lacked gene product. A Kaplan-Meier plot of survival in patients with AML in relation to FHIT expression revealed that aberrance or loss of FHIT gene significantly correlated with a low clinical remission rate and poor overall survival.","['Wang, Li', 'Dong, Lu-Jia', 'Tian, Fang', 'Liu, Guang-Xian', 'Li, Chun-Hai']","['Wang L', 'Dong LJ', 'Tian F', 'Liu GX', 'Li CH']","['Department of Oncology, General Hospital of Beijing Military Area of PLA, Beijing 100700, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2003)02-0153-08 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Apr;11(2):153-60.,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/U46922', 'GENBANK/U88866']",,,,,,,,

Some of the prime cell cycle regulators are involved directly in tumorigenesis. Cyclin A, one of the G(1)/S cyclin, can cause transformation. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether cyclin A overexpression was involved in leukemogenesis and proliferation of leukemia cells. The expression of cyclin A at S-phase in leukemia cell line HL-60, blast cells of acute leukemia patients, bone marrow cells of outpatients without malignant hematological disease and peripheral blood cells of healthy donors was investigated by simultaneous indirect immunofluorescence staining of intracellular antigen and DNA. To further investigate whether cyclin A played as a key molecular in cell proliferation, HL-60 cells were exposed to different concentrations of hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). MTT dye absorbance of living cells and cell cycle analysis were adopted to evaluate growth arrest. Differentiation was evaluated by detection of the change of expression of CD11b and CD33 on cell surface. The results showed that overexpression of cyclin A was only found among specimens from acute leukemia and leukemia cell line. There was no elevated cyclin A detection for cyclin A among specimens from outpatients and healthy donors. In HMBA interference experiment, HMBA was able to induce growth arrest and monocytic macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and all these changes were associated with a marked down-regulation of cyclin A expression. In conclusion, aberrant overexpression of cyclin A at S-phase was only found in leukemia cell lines and blast cells from acute leukemia. The dose-dependent effect of HMBA on cell growth and differentiation of HL-60 cell line which was consistent with the decrease of cyclin A expression in these cells suggested that the molecular mechanisms of HMBA inducement involved downregulation of cyclin A expression.","['Yu, Hui', 'Xie, Yan-Hui', 'Fan, Hua-Hua', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Xie, Yi']","['Yu H', 'Xie YH', 'Fan HH', 'Zheng B', 'Xie Y']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Medical School of Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China. qlfs@sh163.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin A/*analysis/physiology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2003/05/15 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2003)02-0146-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Apr;11(2):146-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was detected by PCR. The results showed that all of the B-ALL patients were positive for CD19.

In the T-lineage cases, there is often some abnormality involving the T-cell receptor loci, most frequently those at 14q11. Other abnormalities occur, but few have a close association with a particular disease type, and so do not often contribute to determining a precise diagnosis. This lack of specificity is due partly to deficiencies in our understanding of the biological relationships between different lymphoid disorders, and also to the various classifications that have been used. As a consequence, there has to be some doubt about the diagnosis assigned to many of the cases in published cytogenetic studies. It is also difficult to combine data from series that have used different classification systems.

For these reasons, this book includes two chapters on the practical aspects of undertaking cytogenetic studies in ALL to illustrate contrasting approaches.

Members of this genus have been shown to be pathogenic in man. The human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus (HTLV) type I has been linked in the etiology of T-cell malignancies and ""autoimmune-like"" neurologic and rheumatic disorders; a related virus, HTLV-II, is becoming increasingly associated with similar disorders. Cell transformation is thought to be caused predominantly by the effects of the viral regulatory protein, Tax. An additional induced host cell molecule, adult T-cell lymphoma-derived factor, may contribute to cell immortalization. Like the DNA tumor viruses, HTLV activates transcription of cellular proto-oncogenes and inhibits cellular mechanisms of tumor suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. However, individuals who are able to mount a strong cell-mediated immune response and limit viral entry into uninfected cells do not develop associated malignancies. Unfortunately, HTLV-induced malignancies are difficult to treat with conventional chemotherapy, and disease progression is often rapid with a median survival of less than 2 years. There are, however, some novel approaches that have yet to be fully tested that may have greater efficacy in the treatment of HTLV-induced diseases. In the future, better screening and detection methods, along with new vaccines and therapies, may contribute to the increased prevention and control of HTLV infection and its associated diseases.","['Poiesz, Bernard J', 'Poiesz, Michael J', 'Choi, David']","['Poiesz BJ', 'Poiesz MJ', 'Choi D']","['Department of Medicine, Upstate Medical University, SUNY Syracuse, New York 13120, USA. poieszb@upstate.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus/*classification/genetics/pathogenicity', '*Deltaretrovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Primates']",149,2003/05/15 05:00,2003/06/12 05:00,['2003/05/15 05:00'],"['2003/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/cnv-120016422 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2003 Apr;21(2):253-77. doi: 10.1081/cnv-120016422.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 50% inhibitory concentration of imatinib was 11-fold higher in KCL22/SR than in the imatinib-sensitive parental cell line, KCL22. However, KCL22/SR showed no mutations in the BCR/ABL gene and no increase in the levels of BCR/ABL protein and P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated BCR/ABL protein was suppressed by imatinib treatment, suggesting that mechanisms independent of BCR/ABL signaling are involved in the imatinib resistance in KCL22/SR cells. DNA microarray analyses demonstrated that the signal transduction-related molecules, RAS p21 protein activator and RhoA, which could affect Ras signaling, and a surface tumor antigen, L6, were upregulated, while c-Myb and activin A receptor were downregulated in KCL22/SR cells. Furthermore, imatinib treatment significantly suppressed the level of phosphorylated p44/42 in KCL22 cells but not in KCL22/SR cells, even when BCR/ABL was inhibited by imatinib.

Preclinical and clinical studies of gemcitabine suggested that myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity. The present investigations were designed to test the effect of continuously administered gemcitabine on the in vitro clonal growth of normal CD34(+) cells isolated from peripheral blood and the promyelocytic cell line, HL-60. For this purpose, CD34(+) and HL-60 cells were cultured in methylcellulose in the continuous presence of 0.1-16 nM of gemcitabine. The results show a dose-dependent inhibition of colony growth of normal as well as leukemic cells. However, HL-60 cells were up to 12-fold more sensitive towards gemcitabine than normal progenitors. For rescue experiments, the natural pyrimidine deoxycytidine (dCyd) was added to CD34(+) and HL-60 cells simultaneously or with delay. Coadministration of 1mM dCyd to separate cultures resulted in complete restoration of colony formation capacity of CD34(+) and HL-60 cells. Delayed addition of 1 mM dCyd after 48 and 72 hours recovered up to 90% and 40%, respectively, of stem cell proliferation, whereas HL-60 cells remained substantially inhibited (4.5% +/- 3.5% versus 0%). Delayed addition after 48 and 72 hours protected about 80% and 50%, respectively, of myelopoietic and erythropoetic colony formation, whereas colony formation obtained from HL-60 cells remained significantly inhibited (9.6% +/- 4.17% versus 0%). These in vitro data suggest that there is a marked difference in the susceptibility of leukemic and normal CD34(+) cells to gemcitabine and that delayed administration of dCyd may further reduce the bone marrow cytotoxicity of gemcitabine without impairing its antitumor effect.","['Tiefenthaler, Martin', 'Hohla, Florian', 'Strasser-Wozak, Elisabeth', 'Bacher, Nicole', 'Muhlmann, Oliver', 'Wein, Wolfgang', 'Konwalinka, Gunther']","['Tiefenthaler M', 'Hohla F', 'Strasser-Wozak E', 'Bacher N', 'Muhlmann O', 'Wein W', 'Konwalinka G']","['Department of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxins/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/immunology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology/physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",,2003/05/14 05:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2003/05/14 05:00'],"['2003/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.21-3-266 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2003;21(3):266-71. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.21-3-266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The L domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) maps to a highly conserved Pro-Thr-Ala-Pro (PTAP) sequence in the p6 domain of Gag. We and others recently observed that the p6 PTAP motif interacts with the cellular endosomal sorting protein TSG101. Consistent with a role for TSG101 in virus release, we demonstrated that overexpressing the N-terminal, Gag-binding domain of TSG101 (TSG-5') suppresses HIV-1 budding by blocking L domain function. To elucidate the role of TSG101 in HIV-1 budding, we evaluated the significance of the binding between Gag and TSG-5' on the inhibition of HIV-1 release. We observed that a mutation in TSG-5' that disrupts the Gag/TSG101 interaction suppresses the ability of TSG-5' to inhibit HIV-1 release. We also determined the effect of overexpressing a panel of truncated TSG101 derivatives and full-length TSG101 (TSG-F) on virus budding. Overexpressing TSG-F inhibits HIV-1 budding; however, the effect of TSG-F on virus release does not require Gag binding. Furthermore, overexpression of the C-terminal portion of TSG101 (TSG-3') potently inhibits budding of not only HIV-1 but also murine leukemia virus. Confocal microscopy data indicate that TSG-F and TSG-3' overexpression induces an aberrant endosome phenotype; this defect is dependent upon the C-terminal, Vps-28-binding domain of TSG101. We propose that TSG-5' suppresses HIV-1 release by binding PTAP and blocking HIV-1 L domain function, whereas overexpressing TSG-F or TSG-3' globally inhibits virus release by disrupting the cellular endosomal sorting machinery. These results highlight the importance of TSG101 and the endosomal sorting pathway in virus budding and suggest that inhibitors can be developed that, like TSG-5', target HIV-1 without disrupting endosomal sorting.","['Goila-Gaur, Ritu', 'Demirov, Dimiter G', 'Orenstein, Jan M', 'Ono, Akira', 'Freed, Eric O']","['Goila-Gaur R', 'Demirov DG', 'Orenstein JM', 'Ono A', 'Freed EO']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*growth & development/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2003/05/14 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/14 05:00'],"['2003/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.11.6507-6519.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jun;77(11):6507-19. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.11.6507-6519.2003.,,,,,,,,,PMC155030,,,,,,,

Expression of the JSRV envelope protein (Env) is sufficient to transform immortalized and primary fibroblasts, but the precise mechanisms of this process are not known. The cellular receptor for JSRV is hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal-2), the product of a putative tumor suppressor gene that in humans maps to a chromosomal region frequently deleted in the development of lung and breast cancers. Here we report studies to determine whether the Hyal-2-JSRV Env interaction plays a role in virus-induced transformation of rodent fibroblasts. Chimeric Env proteins between JSRV and the unrelated murine retroviruses Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMuLV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) showed cell surface expression comparable to that of wild-type MMuLV Env and rescued infection of MMuLV particle pseudotypes. Interestingly, an MMuLV-JSRV chimera in which the putative receptor binding domain (RBD) and proline-rich region (PRR) of JSRV Env were replaced by the RBD and PRR of MMuLV induced transformation of 208F, a rodent fibroblast line. Cell lines derived from foci of MMuLV-JSRV chimera-transformed 208F cells grew in soft agar and showed Akt activation, a hallmark of JSRV-transformed rodent fibroblasts. Transformation assays performed using proteins with amino-terminal deletion mutations showed that the carboxy-terminal 141 amino acids of the transmembrane subunit (TM) were sufficient to induce cell transformation when targeted to the membrane with a myristoylation signal. Thus, the JSRV TM is necessary and sufficient to transform rodent fibroblasts. Taken together these results indicate that the interaction with Hyal-2 at least is not an essential determinant of JSRV-induced transformation of fibroblasts and that the viral TM functions essentially as an oncoprotein.","['Chow, Yen-Hung J', 'Alberti, Alberto', 'Mura, Manuela', 'Pretto, Carla', 'Murcia, Pablo', 'Albritton, Lorraine M', 'Palmarini, Massimo']","['Chow YH', 'Alberti A', 'Mura M', 'Pretto C', 'Murcia P', 'Albritton LM', 'Palmarini M']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology and Comparative Oncology Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens 30602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.2.1.35 (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fibroblasts/*virology', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase/metabolism', 'Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sheep']",,2003/05/14 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/14 05:00'],"['2003/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.11.6341-6350.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jun;77(11):6341-50. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.11.6341-6350.2003.,,,"['R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC155026,,,,,,,

An initial proliferative phase during which cells with limited tumorigenic potential expand is followed by a crisis period marked by high levels of apoptosis and erratic growth. Transformants that survive this phase emerge as fully malignant cells and usually contain mutations that disable the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Consistent with the importance of p53 in this process, pre-B cells from p53 null animals bypass crisis. Thus, the transformation process reflects a balance between signals from the v-Abl protein that drive transformation and those coming from the cellular response to inappropriate growth. One prediction of this hypothesis is that Ab-MLV mutants that are compromised in their ability to transform cells may be less equipped to overcome the effects of p53. To test this idea, we examined the ability of the P120/R273K mutant to transform pre-B cells from wild-type, p53 null, and Ink4a/Arf null mice. The SH2 domain of the v-Abl protein encoded by this mutant contains a substitution that affects the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket, and this mutant is compromised in its ability to transform NIH 3T3 and pre-B cells, especially at 39.5 degrees C. Our data reveal that loss of p53 or Ink4a/Arf locus products complements the transforming defect of the P120/R273K mutant, but it does not completely restore wild-type function. These results indicate that one important transforming function of v-Abl proteins is overcoming the effects of a functional p53 pathway.","['Unnikrishnan, Indira', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Unnikrishnan I', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/*genetics', 'src Homology Domains']",,2003/05/14 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/14 05:00'],"['2003/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.11.6208-6215.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Jun;77(11):6208-15. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.11.6208-6215.2003.,,,"['R01 CA024220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC155034,,,,,,,

Here, we have used cDNA expression cloning to identify a novel human minor H antigen encoded by UGT2B17, an autosomal gene in the multigene UDP-glycosyltransferase 2 family that is selectively expressed in liver, intestine, and antigen-presenting cells. In contrast to previously defined human minor H antigens, UGT2B17 is immunogenic because of differential expression of the protein in donor and recipient cells as a consequence of a homozygous gene deletion in the donor. Deletion of individual members of large gene families is a common form of genetic variation in the population and our results provide the first evidence that differential protein expression as a consequence of gene deletion is a mechanism for generating minor H antigens in humans.","['Murata, Makoto', 'Warren, Edus H', 'Riddell, Stanley R']","['Murata M', 'Warren EH', 'Riddell SR']","['D3-100, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'Epitopes', '*Gene Deletion', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics/physiology', '*Multigene Family', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,2003/05/14 05:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/05/14 05:00'],"['2003/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1084/jem.20030044 [doi]', 'jem.20030044 [pii]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2003 May 19;197(10):1279-89. doi: 10.1084/jem.20030044.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a quantitative assessment of the WT1 transcript amount by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in 173 samples (131 bone marrow samples and 42 peripheral-blood samples) from 131 patients with MDS (79 patients with refractory anemia [RA], 31 with RA with excess blasts [RAEB], 18 with secondary acute myeloid leukemia [s-AML] evolved from MDS, and three with deletion of 5q as the sole cytogenetic abnormality). Values obtained were correlated with the blast percentage and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of BM and 78% of PB samples for RA and 100% of BM and PB samples of RAEB and s-AML expressed WT1 transcript amounts greater than the level observed in healthy volunteers. The degree of WT1 expression was highly correlated with the type of MDS, was much higher in RAEB and s-AML compared with RA, and increased during disease progression. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between WT1 expression levels, blast cell percentage, and the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities. Therefore, we found a significant correlation between the amount of WT1 transcripts and the IPSS score, which currently represents the most reliable risk index of disease progression available for MDS patients. CONCLUSION: WT1 is a useful molecular marker for risk assessment in MDS patients.","['Cilloni, Daniela', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Fava, Milena', 'Scaravaglio, Patrizia', 'Bertini, Marilena', 'Girotto, Mauro', 'Marinone, Carlo', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Gallamini, Andrea', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Cilloni D', 'Gottardi E', 'Messa F', 'Fava M', 'Scaravaglio P', 'Bertini M', 'Girotto M', 'Marinone C', 'Ferrero D', 'Gallamini A', 'Levis A', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicne, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Primers', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'WT1 Proteins/blood/*metabolism']",,2003/05/14 05:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/05/14 05:00'],"['2003/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.10.503 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.10.503 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 May 15;21(10):1988-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.10.503.,,,,,['Piedmont Study Group on Myleodysplastic Syndromes'],,,,,,,,,,,

This compound binds to and directly activates protein kinase C (PKC), arresting the cell cycle at the G(1) phase through inhibition of cdk2 activity in human K562 leukemia cells. In our study, we examined whether cellular PKC is involved in the antiproliferating effect of gnidimacrin. In a 24-hr exposure of K562 cells to high concentrations of bryostatin 1 (0.11-3.3 microM), both expression of PKC alpha and PKC betaII was downregulated, and thereafter these cells became resistant to gnidimacrin in response to the degree of PKC downregulation. In addition, PKC alpha and PKC betaII genes were transfected to gnidimacrin-resistant human hepatoma HLE cells that demonstrated positive expression of PKC alpha and negative expression of PKC betaII. PKC betaII gene-transfected cells became sensitive to gnidimacrin in relation to the degree of PKC betaII expression. The most sensitive clone to show 0.001 microg/mL (1.2 nM) as IC(50) in a continuous 4-day exposure was obtained. While PKC alpha gene-transfected cells exhibited an increase in PKC alpha expression and became sensitive to gnidimacrin, sensitivity was one-hundredth of that in PKC betaIotaIota gene-transfected cells. These results suggest that PKC, in particular PKC betaIotaIota, is necessary in the antitumor effect of gnidimacrin.","['Yoshida, Mitsuzi', 'Heike, Yuji', 'Ohno, Shigeo', 'Ikekawa, Tetsuro', 'Wakasugi, Hiro']","['Yoshida M', 'Heike Y', 'Ohno S', 'Ikekawa T', 'Wakasugi H']","['National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. myoshida@gan2.res.ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '60796-70-5 (gnidimacrin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",,2003/05/13 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/05/13 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11157 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Jul 10;105(5):601-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11157.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carboplatin (CBDCA) induced apoptosis of SCC-9 and SCC-25, human well-differentiated tongue squamous carcinoma cell lines. Neutralizing anti-Fas (APO-1/CD95) and anti-Fas ligand (FasL) antibodies obliterated the CBDCA-induced cell death. In the absence of CBDCA, cytotoxic anti-Fas antibody, which binds to and activates Fas at the cell surface, failed to induce apoptosis. However, in the presence of CBDCA, the cytotoxic antibody markedly enhanced the apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting and reverse-transcription (RT) PCR revealed that there were no alterations in Fas or FasL expression upon CBDCA treatment. SCC-25 induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells, Fas-sensitive T-lymphatic leukemia cell line, and the apoptosis was inhibited by neutralizing anti-Fas or anti-FasL antibody. These results indicate that the tongue carcinoma cells express nonfunctional Fas and functional FasL, which by themselves fail to induce apoptosis. The expression of FADD in the tongue carcinoma cells was very low and was largely enhanced by CBDCA treatment. Suppression of FADD expression using the specific antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a failure of CBDCA induction of cell death. These results indicate that a deficiency of FADD is involved in the insensitivity of tongue carcinoma cells for Fas activation, and that CBDCA treatment switches nonfunctional Fas to functional Fas by upregulation of FADD expression, resulting in activation of a Fas-sensitive pathway leading to apoptosis.","['Mishima, Koichi', 'Nariai, Yoshiki', 'Yoshimura, Yasuro']","['Mishima K', 'Nariai Y', 'Yoshimura Y']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Shimane Medical University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane 693-8501, Japan. omfs3@shimane-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Carboplatin/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/immunology/*physiology']",,2003/05/13 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/05/13 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11133 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Jul 10;105(5):593-600. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11133.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs prefer to adopt a closed conformation with an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the indole NH group and the pyranose oxygen atom. Three pairs of indolocarbazole monoglycosides bearing an NH or an N-methyl indole moiety were synthesized and their biological properties investigated at the molecular and cellular level. Replacing the indole NH proton with a methyl group reduces DNA interaction and abolishes activity against DNA topoisomerase I. Surface plasmon resonance studies performed with a pair of water-soluble indolocarbazole glycosides and two hairpin oligonucleotides containing an [AT]4 or a [CG]4 sequence indicate that both the NH and the N-methyl derivative maintain a relatively high affinity for DNA (Keq = 2 - 6 x 10(5) M(-1)) but the incorporation of the methyl group restricts access to the DNA. The number of ligand binding sites (n) on the oligonucleotides is about twice as high for the NH compound compared to its N-methyl analogue. Modeling and 1H NMR studies demonstrate that addition of the N-methyl group drives a radical change in conformation in which the orientation of the aglycone relative to the beta-glucoside is reversed. The loss of the closed conformation by the N-methyl derivatives perturbs thir ability to access DNA binding sites and prevents the drug from inhibiting topoisomerase I. As a consequence, the NH compounds exhibit potent cytotoxicity against CEM leukemia cells with an IC50 value in the 1 microM range, whereas the N-methyl analogues are 10 to 100 times less cytotoxic. These studies offer circumstantial evidence supporting the importance of the closed conformation in the interaction of indolocarbazole glycosides with their molecular targets, DNA and topoisomerase I.","['Facompre, Michael', 'Carrasco, Carolina', 'Vezin, Herve', 'Chisholm, John D', 'Yoburn, Joshua C', 'Van Vranken, David L', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Facompre M', 'Carrasco C', 'Vezin H', 'Chisholm JD', 'Yoburn JC', 'Van Vranken DL', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U524 et Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun 59045 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Polyribonucleotides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '26966-61-0 (Poly dA-dT)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Glucosides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Poly dA-dT/chemistry/metabolism', 'Polyribonucleotides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/13 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2003/05/13 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbic.200200478 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2003 May 9;4(5):386-95. doi: 10.1002/cbic.200200478.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although in estrogen deficiency and in estrogen receptor knockout mice there is significant alteration in bone marrow hematopoiesis, the effects of aging on estrogen receptor deficiencies in mice have not been investigated yet. In this study we show that by 1.5 years of age, estrogen receptor beta knockout (ERbeta-/-) mice develop pronounced splenomegaly that is much more severe in females than in males. Further characterization of these mice revealed myelogenous hyperplasia in bone marrow, an increase in the number of granulocytes and B lymphocytes in blood, lymphadenopathy, and infiltration of leukocytes in the liver and lung. Analysis by flow cytometry of the bone marrow cells revealed that the percentage and total number of Gr-1hi/Mac-1hi-positive granulocytes were increased by 15-30% and 100%, respectively. The numbers of B cells in the bone marrow and spleen were significantly higher in ERbeta-/- mice than in WT littermates. Some of the ERbeta-/- mice also had a severe lymphoproliferative phenotype. Thus the absence of ERbeta results in a myeloproliferative disease resembling human chronic myeloid leukemia with lymphoid blast crisis. Our results indicate a previously unknown role for ERbeta in regulating the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and suggest that the ERbeta-/- mouse is a potential model for myeloid and lymphoid leukemia. Furthermore, we suggest that ERbeta agonists might have clinical value in the treatment of leukemia.","['Shim, Gil-Jin', 'Wang, Ling', 'Andersson, Sandra', 'Nagy, Noemi', 'Kis, Lorand Levente', 'Zhang, Qinghong', 'Makela, Sari', 'Warner, Margaret', 'Gustafsson, Jan-Ake']","['Shim GJ', 'Wang L', 'Andersson S', 'Nagy N', 'Kis LL', 'Zhang Q', 'Makela S', 'Warner M', 'Gustafsson JA']","['Department of Medical Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, NOVUM, S-141 86 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor beta', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*genetics/metabolism']",,2003/05/13 05:00,2003/07/17 05:00,['2003/05/13 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0731830100 [doi]', '0731830100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 May 27;100(11):6694-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0731830100.

METHODS: Growth inhibition of K562 cells was measured by the microculture tetrozolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Following exposure of K-562 cells to salvicine plus Act D for 24 h, Act D at the concentrations of 0.04, 0.4, and 4 micromol/L potentiated the cytotoxicity of salvicine 6.25 micromol/L to some degree. The mean growth inhibitory rates went from 8 % up to 69 %, 71 %, and 70 %, respectively. However, the same enhancement of Act D did not continue to emerge at the higher concentrations than salvicine 6.25 micromol/L. Act D enhanced, or at least, did not decrease the cytotoxicity of salvicine against K562 cells. Fluorescence microscopy, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry revealed that Act D concentration-dependently inhibited the induction of apoptosis by salvicine in the same cell line. CONCLUSION: The combination of salvicine and Act D in a proper range of concentrations is able to enhance the cytotoxicity of salvicine against K562 cells though inhibiting apoptosis. The other mechanisms of cell death except apoptosis may be implicated in the process.","['Qing, Chen', 'Miao, Ze-Hong', 'Tong, Lin-Jiang', 'Zhang, Jin-Sheng', 'Ding, Jian']","['Qing C', 'Miao ZH', 'Tong LJ', 'Zhang JS', 'Ding J']","['Division of Antitumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China. jding@mail.shcnc.ac.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (salvicine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology']",,2003/05/13 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/05/13 05:00'],"['2003/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2003 May;24(5):415-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also showed that PU.1 interacts with the transcriptional co-activator CREB binding protein (CBP). In this study, we have investigated whether CBP is involved in PU.1-induced growth inhibition, differentiation block and apoptosis in MEL cells. Overexpression of CBP rescued MEL cells from PU.1-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, while it did not release the cells from PU.1-induced block of erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that sequestration of CBP is involved in PU.1-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis but not differentiation block in MEL cells.

To investigate the role of TEL in the growth and differentiation of K562 cells, we introduced an expression plasmid containing the TEL gene into the cells. Overexpression of TEL in K562 cells leads to inhibition of the endogenous expression of megakaryocyte-specific GPIIb and GPIbalpha genes, and inhibition of cell growth.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Proliferation and ELISPOT assays (for T cells producing IFN-gamma after stimulation by CD40-activated CLL cells) were used to determine the prevalence of tumor-reactive T cells in 25 CLL patients at various stages of disease progression. The effects of vaccines, composed of autologous-oxidized tumor cells, on both the clinical course and tumor-reactive T-cell numbers were then determined in 2 patients. RESULTS: CLL-reactive T cells were found at frequencies of > or =10(-3) in 6 of 11 patients. Significant proliferation was found in 15 of 25 patients and correlated with clinical stage. The inability to measure CLL-reactive T cells in the remaining patients was not uniformly a result of generalized T-cell dysfunction or defective antigen presentation by CD40-activated CLL cells. CLL-reactive T-cell frequencies increased in response to vaccination with oxidized autologous tumor cells in a patient with preexisting CLL-reactive T cells but not in a patient where tumor-reactive T cells were undetectable in the ELISPOT assay. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-reactive T cells exist in some CLL patients (mainly during earlier stages of disease) and may potentially mediate therapeutic responses if their numbers and activation states can be sufficiently increased by tumor vaccines.","['Gitelson, Elena', 'Hammond, Caitlin', 'Mena, Jenny', 'Lorenzo, Maria', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Berinstein, Neil L', 'Imrie, Kevin', 'Spaner, David E']","['Gitelson E', 'Hammond C', 'Mena J', 'Lorenzo M', 'Buckstein R', 'Berinstein NL', 'Imrie K', 'Spaner DE']","[""Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario, M4N 3M5 Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2003/05/10 05:00,2004/01/13 05:00,['2003/05/10 05:00'],"['2003/05/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 May;9(5):1656-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous exposure (30 hours) of U937 monocytic leukemia cells to minimally toxic concentrations of 17-AAG (eg, 400 nM) and UCN-01 (eg, 75 nM) triggered a pronounced increase in mitochondrial injury (ie, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential [Deltapsim]; cytosolic release of cytochrome c), caspase activation, and apoptosis. Synergistic induction of apoptosis was also observed in other human leukemia cell types (eg, Jurkat, NB4). Coexposure of human leukemia cells to 17-AAG and the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (GFX) did not result in enhanced lethality, arguing against the possibility that the PKC inhibitory actions of UCN-01 are responsible for synergistic interactions. The enhanced cytotoxicity of this combination was associated with diminished Akt activation and marked down-regulation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Coadministration of 17-AAG and UCN-01 did not modify expression of Hsp90, Hsp27, phospho-JNK, or phospho-p38 MAPK, but was associated with further p34cdc2 dephosphorylation and diminished expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and XIAP. In addition, inducible expression of both a constitutively active MEK1/2 or myristolated Akt construct, which overcame inhibition of ERK and Akt activation, respectively, significantly attenuated 17-AAG/UCN-01-mediated lethality. Together, these findings indicate that the Hsp90 antagonist 17-AAG potentiates UCN-01 cytotoxicity in a variety of human leukemia cell types and suggest that interference with both the Akt and Raf-1/MEK/MAP kinase cytoprotective signaling pathways contribute to this phenomenon.","['Jia, Wentao', 'Yu, Chunrong', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Krystal, Geoffrey', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Jia W', 'Yu C', 'Rahmani M', 'Krystal G', 'Sausville EA', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, MCV Station Box 230, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', '*Leukemia', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/05/10 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/05/10 05:00'],"['2003/05/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3785 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44170-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 1;102(5):1824-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3785.

Nine of 10 patients who underwent SC transplantation 3.5 months or less following GO developed VOD compared with none of 4 patients who underwent SC transplantation more than 3.5 months from GO administration.

A supervised approach using the Student t test selected a prognostic set of 35 genes, some of which are associated with the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Most of these genes had not previously been reported to be associated with prognosis and were not correlated with morphologically classified French-American-British (FAB) subtypes or with karyotypes.

Volunteers provided food and observed the cats that were returned to their capture sites on campus and maintained in managed colonies. The program placed kittens and tame cats for adoption; cats totaled 158. Of the majority of 158 captured cats, there were less kittens caught in Year 2 than in Year 1. The proportion of tame cats trapped was significantly greater in Year 2 than in Year 1. The prevalence found for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus ELISA test positives was 5.8% and 6.5%, respectively. Following surgery, 101 cats returned to campus. The project recaptured, retested, and revaccinated more than one-fourth of the cats due for their annual vaccinations. The program placed 32 kittens, juveniles, and tame adults for adoption.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of patients treated with RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer between 1991 and 1999 at Duke University were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-five patients were identified who had received continuous course once-daily 1.8-2 Gy fractions to approximately 60 Gy (range 58-66). All patients received chemotherapy (CHT); 32 received concurrent RT/CHT and 33 sequential CHT and then RT. Prophylactic cranial RT was administered to 17 patients. The time from diagnosis to local failure, tumor progression, and death was assessed using actuarial methods. The median follow-up for all patients was 16.7 months and for surviving patients was 29.6 months. The median age was 64 years (range 36-83), and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80 (range 50-100). RESULTS: The 3-year actuarial rate of local failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 40%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. One case of acute Grade 3 esophagitis developed. Ten late complications occurred: four pulmonary, two esophageal, two infectious, one leukemia, and one retinal toxicity with prophylactic cranial RT. Six were mild and resolved with treatment. CONCLUSION: CHT plus approximately 60 Gy of once-daily RT for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer was generally well tolerated. The survival rates were less than have been reported using 45 Gy in 1.5-Gy twice-daily fractions (2-year overall survival rate 47% compared with 30% in this study), but may be comparable because fewer than one-half our patients received concurrent CHT/RT and only 26% received prophylactic cranial RT. The relatively low rate of normal tissue morbidity in our patients supports the use of conventional once-daily fractionation to > or = 60 Gy. A randomized trial would be required to compare the outcomes after maximally tolerated dose twice-daily RT vs. maximally tolerated dose daily RT.","['Miller, Keith L', 'Marks, Lawrence B', 'Sibley, Gregory S', 'Clough, Robert W', 'Garst, Jennifer L', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Shafman, Timothy D']","['Miller KL', 'Marks LB', 'Sibley GS', 'Clough RW', 'Garst JL', 'Crawford J', 'Shafman TD']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, and, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/10 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/10 05:00'],"['2003/05/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301602044930 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(02)04493-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Jun 1;56(2):355-9. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(02)04493-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL B lymphocytes transform (mature) to a plasmacytic phenotype with loss of CD19 and CD20 and the appearance of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin when treated in vitro with phorbol esters. We have used array hybridization technology to describe gene expression patterns for untreated and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)-treated CLL B cells at 5, 10, and 20 min following initial TPA exposure. Three genes, early growth response factor 1 (EGR-1), dual specificity phosphatase 2, and CD69 (early T-cell activation antigen), showed a 2.0-fold or greater increase in mRNA transcription at four or more of six time points in two studies. Upregulation of expression of these genes was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the TPA-treated cells of four CLL patients. A progressive increase in gene expression was observed during the 20-min time course for all three genes. In addition, protein expression of EGR-1 and CD69 was increased as measured by immunofluorescence cell analysis. Several genes (PKC, n-myc, jun D, and BCL-2) previously reported as overexpressed in CLL lymphocytes were overexpressed in these studies also, but were not altered by TPA treatment. Genes for proteins whose upregulation requires hours of TPA exposure (the 4F2hc component of the L-system amino acid transporter, prohibition, and hsp60) were assessed, and their later expression contrasted with the early expression of EGR-1, dual specificity phosphatase 2, and CD69. EGR-1 encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that is induced by pokeweed mitogen and TPA and promotes B lymphocyte maturation. The dual specificity phosphatase 2 encodes an enzyme that reverses mitogen activated protein kinase cell activation by dephosphorylation.

Cationic emulsions were prepared by microfluidization as previously described by Teixeira et al. [Pharm. Res 16 (1999) 30]. The formulations consisted mainly of medium chain triglycerides, phosphatidylcholine (PC), poloxamer, and either a monocationic lipid stearylamine (PC/SA-emulsion) or a polycationic lipid RPRC(18) (PC/RPRC(18)-emulsion). A model ON (33P-pdT(16)) was associated with cationic emulsions by single addition at the end of the manufacturing process. Seven days after P388/ADR inoculation IP to mice, ON free or associated with PC/SA or PC/RPRC(18) emulsions was injected IP at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. At different interval times, ascite including cells, blood and the main organs were collected and the radioactivity counted by liquid scintillation. The overall results showed significantly high amounts of ON in the leukemic cell pellet, 24 h after administration of ON associated to either PC/SA (AUC(0-24 h)=13634, %injected dose/min) or PC/RPRC(18) (AUC(0-24 h)=22592, % injected dose/min), contrary to the free ON solution (AUC(0-24 h)=3095, %injected dose/min), which displayed only reduced capture by cancer cells. In conclusion, complexation of ON with cationic emulsions had a beneficial effect in increasing tumor cells uptake in vivo (up to sevenfold for PC/RPRC(18)-emulsion) after IP administration. This could open interesting prospects for the treatment of ovarian cancers.","['Teixeira, H', 'Dubernet, C', 'Chacun, H', 'Rabinovich, L', 'Boutet, V', 'Deverre, J R', 'Benita, S', 'Couvreur, P']","['Teixeira H', 'Dubernet C', 'Chacun H', 'Rabinovich L', 'Boutet V', 'Deverre JR', 'Benita S', 'Couvreur P']","[""Laboratoire de Physico-chimie, Pharmacotechnie et Biopharmacie, UMR 8612, Universite Paris XI, Centre d'Etudes Pharmaceutiques 5, Rue J B Clement 92296, Chatenay-Malabry, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cations', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Emulsions', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Oligonucleotides/*administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,2003/05/10 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/05/10 05:00'],"['2003/05/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365903001019 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(03)00101-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2003 May 20;89(3):473-82. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(03)00101-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TEL gene is involved in more than 40 different chromosomal translocations associated with haematological malignancies. As little is known about the function of intact TEL, we searched for TEL-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening. Among the interacting partners, we identified the histone acetyltransferase protein Tip60 [60 kDa trans-acting regulatory protein of HIV type 1 (Tat)-interacting protein]. The interaction was reproduced in vitro, and in mammalian cells we mapped the interaction regions in TEL to the ETS domain and those in Tip60 to the MYST ('MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, SAS2 and Tip60', where MOZ stands for male absent on the first, SAS for something about silencing and Ybf2 for identical with SAS2) region. Detailed analysis of the Tip60 MYST domain by introduction of point mutations revealed that an N-terminal C2HC zinc finger was essential for interaction with TEL. Finally, we showed that Tip60 functions in a reporter system as a co-repressor in TEL-mediated transcription repression.","['Nordentoft, Iver', 'Jorgensen, Poul']","['Nordentoft I', 'Jorgensen P']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, C.

We have investigated the potential of trypsin to induce TNF-alpha secretion from the human leukemic mast cell line (HMC-1). HMC-1 cells co-express both PAR2 and PAR4, and their agonist trypsin signals to HMC-1 cells. Trypsin (100 nm), SLIGKV-NH(2) (100 microm, corresponding to the PAR2 tethered ligand), or GYPGQV-NH(2) (100 microm, corresponding to the PAR4 tethered ligand) induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion from HMC-1 cells. TNF-alpha secretion by trypsin was significantly blocked by pretreatment with 50 microm PD098059, MEK-1 inhibitor. Furthermore, trypsin stimulated the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in HMC-1 cells without any detectable activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase homologue.

However, systemic toxicity associated with As(2)O(3) treatment remains a problem. Inorganic arsenic is detoxified in vivo by methylation reactions into organic arsenic compounds that are less toxic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), an organic arsenic derivative and major metabolic by-product of As(2)O(3), against a panel of eight leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines. As(2)O(3) was tested in comparison. In clonogenic assay, the average concentration of DMAA that suppressed cell colony growth by 50% was 0.5-1 m M, while for As(2)O(3) it was on average 1-2 microM. At those concentrations DMAA and As(2)O(3) had significantly less effect on colony growth of normal progenitor cells. Cytotoxic doses of DMAA and As(2)O(3) in 3-day trypan blue dye exclusion assay experiments were similar to doses effective in clonogenic assay. Assessment of apoptosis by annexin V assay revealed a high rate of apoptosis in all cell lines treated with DMAA and As(2)O(3), but significantly less effect on normal progenitor cells. DMAA, unlike As(2)O(3), had no effect on the maturation of leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: DMAA exerts differential antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity against leukemia and multiple myeloma cells, with no significant effect on normal progenitor cells. However, concentrations of DMAA needed to achieve such efficacy are up to 1000 times those of As(2)O(3). Evaluation of novel organic arsenic that would combine the high efficacy of As(2)O(3) and the low toxicity of DMAA is warranted.","['Duzkale, Hatice', 'Jilani, Iman', 'Orsolic, Nada', 'Zingaro, Ralph A', 'Golemovic, Mirna', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Duzkale H', 'Jilani I', 'Orsolic N', 'Zingaro RA', 'Golemovic M', 'Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Albitar M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Special Medical Education Programs, The University of Texas M.

Changes in nucleoside transporter expression and activity have been shown to occur in NB4 cells in vitro following treatment with ATRA. In this study we investigated whether ATRA treatment increases sensitivity to ara-C in NB4 cells. Specifically, we examined the role of ATRA-associated changes in nucleoside transporter expression and activity in eliciting ara-C cytotoxicity. METHODS: Cellular uptake of [(3)H]-ara-C and nucleoside transporter abundance were determined in untreated cells and cells treated with 1 microM ATRA for 12-72 h using an inhibitor and oil stop procedure, and an equilibrium [(3)H]-NBMPR binding assay, respectively. Cytotoxicity of ara-C and the apoptotic response prior to and following ATRA treatment were determined using the MTT viability assay and the TUNEL assay, respectively. RESULTS: ATRA treatment increased ara-C cytotoxicity and potency, ara-C transport, and augmented ara-C-induced apoptosis. The combination effect was supraadditive under some conditions and sequence-dependent whereby the maximum effect was seen when the addition of ATRA preceded the addition of ara-C, and when ara-C administration closely followed ATRA administration. CONCLUSIONS: The ATRA-induced increase in cytotoxicity of ara-C was, in part, the result of an increase in the functional expression of nucleoside transporters, and a role for bcl-2 was also indicated. Our results would suggest that timing of ara-C therapy should be tied to maximal es transporter expression, which is likely to be 24 h after ATRA treatment begins. It remains to be seen whether the response in the clinic can be further enhanced in APL by taking advantage of ara-C transporter regulation by ATRA.","['Flanagan, S A', 'Meckling, K A']","['Flanagan SA', 'Meckling KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/09 05:00,2003/06/25 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2002/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0561-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 May;51(5):363-75. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0561-0.

The use of real-time PCR in molecular diagnostics has increased to the point where it is now accepted as the gold standard for detecting a wide variety of templates including viruses. Therefore, we developed a rapid quantification system of CMV using a LightCycler in order to clarify the possible role of CMV reactivation in patients with hematologic neoplasia showing pulmonary complications. Sixty-nine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens were obtained from consecutively treated patients showing interstitial shadow including 20 patients with hematologic neoplasia. First, we determined the viral burden in BAL cells from healthy volunteers, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and sarcoidosis. CMV copy numbers in samples obtained from healthy volunteers, IIP and sarcoidosis, were less than 10(2) copies per 1 microg of DNA, whether or not BAL cells were composed of high percentage of lymphocytes. Among 20 patients with hematologic neoplasia analyzed, two specimens obtained from leukemia patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, two from GvHD, one with CMV interstitial pneumonia and one with Hodgkin's disease had high level of CMV viral DNA. Our results suggest that measurement of CMV genomes in BAL cells using real-time PCR may be useful not only to understand the involvement of CMV in systematic respiratory tract disease but also in management of the care of respiratory complications in hematologic neoplasia.","['Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Nagate, Akira', 'Ojima, Tomoko', 'Abe, Kenji', 'Yamamoto, Kohtaro', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Nagate A', 'Ojima T', 'Abe K', 'Yamamoto K', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Intractable Diseases Research Center, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. junko@hh.iij4u.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmids', 'Pneumonia, Viral/etiology/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/etiology/virology']",,2003/05/09 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2003 Jun;11(6):779-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rhodexin A at 30-100 nM increased the G(2)M population, but decreased the G(0)G(1) population, suggesting cell cycle arrest in the G(2)M phase.

L5178Y cells were the most radiosensitive, while CHO-K1 cells and HMV-II cells were radioresistant. There was an inverse relationship between the survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) and the yield of initial DNA strand breaks per unit dose under the alkaline condition for the comet assay, and also a relationship between SF2 and the residual DNA strand breaks (for 4 hr after irradiation) under the neutral condition for the comet assay, the latter being generally considered to be relative to cellular radiosensitivity. In the present analysis, it was considered that the alkaline condition for the comet assay was optimal for evaluating the initial DNA strand breaks, while the neutral condition was optimal for evaluating the residual DNA strand breaks. Since the comet assay is simpler and more rapid than other methods for detecting radiation-induced DNA damage, this assay appears to be a useful predictive assay for evaluating cellular clonogenic radiosensitivity of tumor cells.","['Wada, Seiichi', 'Kurahayashi, Hidemitsu', 'Kobayashi, Yasuhiko', 'Funayama, Tomoo', 'Yamamoto, Kazuo', 'Natsuhori, Masahiro', 'Ito, Nobuhiko']","['Wada S', 'Kurahayashi H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Funayama T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Natsuhori M', 'Ito N']","['Biotechnology Laboratory, JAERI-Takasaki, Watanuki-machi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Death/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Comet Assay/*veterinary', 'Cricetinae', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia', 'Linear Models', 'Melanoma', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/09 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.65.471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2003 Apr;65(4):471-7. doi: 10.1292/jvms.65.471.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multiple myeloma, first-line regimens incorporating high-dose therapy yield higher remission rates than do conventional-dose treatments, but evidence that this translates into improved survival is limited. METHODS: In this multicenter study, the Medical Research Council Myeloma VII Trial, we randomly assigned 407 patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who were younger than 65 years of age to receive either standard conventional-dose combination chemotherapy or high-dose therapy and an autologous stem-cell transplant. RESULTS: Among the 401 patients who could be evaluated, the rates of complete response were higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (44 percent vs. 8 percent, P<0.001). The rates of partial response were similar (42 percent and 40 percent, respectively; P=0.72), and the rates of minimal response were lower in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (3 percent vs. 18 percent, P<0.001). Intention-to-treat analysis showed a higher rate of overall survival (P=0.04 by the log-rank test) and progression-free survival (P<0.001) in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group. As compared with standard therapy, intensive treatment increased median survival by almost 1 year (54.1 months [95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 65.2] vs. 42.3 months [95 percent confidence interval, 33.1 to 51.6]). There was a trend toward a greater survival benefit in the group of patients with a poor prognosis, as defined by a high beta2-microglobulin level (more than 8 mg per liter). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose therapy with autologous stem-cell rescue is an effective first-line treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who are younger than 65 years of age.","['Child, J Anthony', 'Morgan, Gareth J', 'Davies, Faith E', 'Owen, Roger G', 'Bell, Susan E', 'Hawkins, Kim', 'Brown, Julia', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Selby, Peter J']","['Child JA', 'Morgan GJ', 'Davies FE', 'Owen RG', 'Bell SE', 'Hawkins K', 'Brown J', 'Drayson MT', 'Selby PJ']","['Academic Unit of Haematology and Oncology, Cancer Research United Kingdom Clinical Centre, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom. tony.child@leedsth.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,2003/05/09 05:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa022340 [doi]', '348/19/1875 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2003 May 8;348(19):1875-83. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa022340.,['Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,,['Medical Research Council Adult Leukaemia Working Party'],,,,,['Curr Hematol Rep. 2004 Jan;3(1):65-6.

DMXAA activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor, which is involved in TNF synthesis and has also been suggested to mediate resistance to TNF. We wished to determine whether tumour cell NF-kappaB activation modulated the in vitro and in vivo effects of DMXAA. We compared the response of the 70Z/3 pre-B lymphoma cell line with that of its mutant 1.3E2 sub-line, which has a defective gamma-subunit of IKK, the kinase that phosphorylates IkappaB leading to NF-kappaB activation. As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), DMXAA induced in vitro translocation of NF-kappaB (p50 and p65 subunits) into the nucleus of 70Z/3 cells, but not of 1.3E2 cells. However, when the cell lines were then grown as subcutaneous tumours in mice and treated with DMXAA (25 mg/kg), activation of NF-kappaB was found in nuclear extracts prepared from both 70/Z3 and 1.3E2 tumours, as well as from Colon 38 tumours that were used for comparison. This suggests that DMXAA induces NF-kappaB responses in host components of the tumour. Tumours grown from both 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells were found to regress completely following DMXAA treatment. Thus, the antitumour action of DMXAA appears to be independent of the ability of the target tumour cell population to induce NF-kappaB expression. Moreover, activation of NF-kappaB in the tumour cell did not confer resistance to DMXAA-induced therapy.","['Woon, S-T', 'Zwain, S', 'Schooltink, M A', 'Newth, A L', 'Baguley, B C', 'Ching, L-M']","['Woon ST', 'Zwain S', 'Schooltink MA', 'Newth AL', 'Baguley BC', 'Ching LM']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Auckland University, Private Bay 92019, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '0 (Xanthones)', '0829J8133H (vadimezan)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthenes/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Xanthones']",,2003/05/09 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804903001965 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(03)00196-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2003 May;39(8):1176-83. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(03)00196-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may complicate CLL at any time during the course of the disease. Different factors concur to the occurrence of anemia in CLL, as in other lymphoproliferative diseases: leukemic bone marrow infiltration, the myelosuppressive effect of chemotherapy and inhibiting cytokines, autoimmune phenomena, hypersplenism, a poor nutritional status that leads to folic acid, vitamin B12 and iron deficiency. In addition, a defective endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production has also been described in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. The severity of anemia, which may be worsened by an impaired cardiopulmonary function, may profoundly compromise the patients' quality of life and, indirectly, the outcome of cancer bearing patients. Several Authors have reported the clinical activity of recombinant human (rHu)EPO in anemic patients with lymphoproliferative diseases, including CLL. Low serum EPO levels at baseline and EPO levels inappropriately low for the degree of anemia help to identify patients who are likely to respond to EPO. A clear dose-dependent response to EPO has been reported by different Authors and it has been suggested that 5,000 IU should be considered as an appropriate initial dose for the majority of patients. rHuEPO represents a potentially effective and safe therapy for the management of anemia associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. The reduction of red blood cell transfusion requirement, the improvement of quality of life through the remission of fatigue-related anemia are two important results that should be considered in the management of patients with CLL. In prospect, the availability of new rHuEPO molecules with a more prolonged half-life may open new therapeutic avenues.","['Mauro, Francesca R', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Foa, Robin']","['Mauro FR', 'Gentile M', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,9815344,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/blood/*deficiency/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications/therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Nutrition Disorders/complications', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",58,2003/05/09 05:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Clin Exp Hematol. 2002;Suppl 1:21-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both for the protection of the individual transplant recipient and as a matter of public health policy, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for the use of vaccination in the prevention of infectious disease following transplantation. This review examines the primary clinical research supporting vaccination policies in this target population. Widely accepted recommendations for transplant recipients based on scientific data are sparse, as few large studies have been conducted in this population. Anecdotal reports, expert advice, summaries, and limited series involving less than 50 patients using surrogate end points form the basis of the scientific literature, with the result being a wide variation in practice. Although based largely on inadequate scientific data, the CDC recommendations offer a pragmatic approach to the prevention of opportunistic disease in hematopoietic transplant recipients and serve as a useful starting point for standardization of practice while defining the direction of future studies in transplant recipients and other immunocompromised hosts.","['Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Cicogna, Cristina E', 'Rowley, Scott D', 'Pecora, Andrew L']","['Goldberg SL', 'Cicogna CE', 'Rowley SD', 'Pecora AL']","['Leukemia Service Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA. sgoldberg@humed.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control', '*Vaccination']",78,2003/05/09 05:00,2003/07/31 05:00,['2003/05/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['163745 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 2003 Apr;17(4):539-54, 559; discussion 559-60, 564-5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resveratrol has also been shown to induce antiproliferation and apoptosis of several leukemia cell lines. In the present study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol in adult T cell leukemia. Our present observations showed that resveratrol induced growth inhibition in all five human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-infected cell lines examined, with 50% effective dose of 10.4-85.6 mM. In the resveratrol-treated cells, induction of apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V-based analyses and morphological changes. The most surprising observation was that resveratrol treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in the expression of survivin, an antiapoptotic protein, during cell apoptosis. These findings indicate that resveratrol inhibits the growth of human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-infected cell lines, at least in part, by inducing apoptosis mediated by downregulation in survivin expression. In view of the accumulating evidence that survivin may be an important determinant of a clinical response in adult T cell leukemia, our present findings have led to the suggestion that resveratrol, a common constituent of the human diet, merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for this incurable disease.","['Hayashibara, Toshihisa', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Nakayama, Susumu', 'Harasawa, Hitomi', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Miyanishi, Takayuki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Maita, Tetsuo']","['Hayashibara T', 'Yamada Y', 'Nakayama S', 'Harasawa H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Sugahara K', 'Miyanishi T', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Maita T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan. lantisth@pop02.odn.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Survivin)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Annexin A5/drug effects', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Resveratrol', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Survivin']",,2003/05/08 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/05/08 05:00'],"['2003/05/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/S15327914NC4402_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2002;44(2):193-201. doi: 10.1207/S15327914NC4402_12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four control diets included rodent chow, a diet containing 5% of a blended oil mimicking the fatty acid composition of rodent chow, and diets containing 5% or 10% fat with safflower oil as the main oil source. The two DHA-supplemented diets provided 1.5% or 3.5% DHA and 5% or 10% total fat, respectively. After tumor cell inoculation, mice were treated with AraC for 10 days. Mice fed the 5% safflower oil diet (30.1 -/+ 4.1 days), but not those fed the 10% safflower oil diet, survived longer than the chow-fed animals (22.1 -/+ 3.1 days, P = 0.05). The 1.5%-/+ DHA diet (average intake 1.8 g DHA/kg/day) was associated with a longer life span (33.3 -/+ 3.4 days, P < 0.01 vs. chow-fed) and no incidence of death due to drug toxicity. Further increasing DHA intake (4.5 g DHA/kg/day) resulted in shortened survival time (26.5 -/+ 2.0 days), increased circulating tumor cell burden, and lowered red blood cell concentrations. These data suggest that a modest level of dietary DHA or linoleic acid supplementation may improve the antineoplastic efficacy of AraC. However, overconsumption of DHA reverses the beneficial effect of DHA intake on drug sensitivity.","['Cha, Ming C', 'Meckling, Kelly A', 'Stewart, Christine']","['Cha MC', 'Meckling KA', 'Stewart C']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutrition Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada N1G 2W1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Dietary Supplements/*statistics & numerical data', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocyte Count/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Platelet Count/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/08 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/05/08 05:00'],"['2003/05/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/S15327914NC4402_09 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2002;44(2):176-81. doi: 10.1207/S15327914NC4402_09.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with digestion of DNA with Hpa II was used to examine the methylation patterns of the CT gene in 73 patients with MHD, 6 healthy people and 24 patients with nonmalignant hematological disorders (NON-MHD). RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the CT gene occurred in 12 of 14 (85.7%) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 9 of 15 (60%) acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 8 of 10 (80%) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 5 of 15 (33.3%) malignant lymphoma (ML), 2 of 5 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 1 of 2 malignant histiocytosis (MH), 1 of 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 1 of 9 multiple myeloma (MM). However, it did not occur in normal controls and NON-MHD. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of CT gene may serve as an important molecular maker for tumorous cell clone and may be useful in diagnosing MHD, monitoring minimal residual disease and predicting prognosis.","['Tang, Y', 'Deng, C', 'Du, Q', 'Li, G']","['Tang Y', 'Deng C', 'Du Q', 'Li G']","[""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu 610072, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Hua Xi Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Hua xi yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of West China University of Medical Sciences = Huaxi yike daxue xuebao,8609552,['9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)'],IM,"['Calcitonin/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2003/05/08 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/05/08 05:00'],"['2003/05/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hua Xi Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2001 Mar;32(1):86-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors updated an earlier study on the nature and risk of second neoplasms (SN) in patients treated with megavoltage radiotherapy as children. METHODS: The authors followed 446 children who were treated for a primary malignancy with megavoltage radiotherapy between January 16, 1954 and December 31, 1980. These children survived a minimum of 5 years. The nature and incidence of SNs were evaluated in this population. Patients with bilateral retinoblastoma or neurofibromatosis were excluded from the study due to their large genetically based predisposition for developing an SN. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival rate was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74-85%) at 30 years for all patients. Thirty-seven (8.3%) patients developed SNs, most of which occurred within the original radiation treatment field, 3.8-31.8 years (median, 15.5 years) after radiotherapy. The cumulative risk of developing an SN was 13% (95% CI 9-19%) at 30 years and the standardized incidence ratio for the development of any SN was 5.2 (95% CI 3.4-7.6%). The most common SNs were breast carcinoma (n = 8), skin carcinoma (five basal cell carcinomas, two malignant melanomas, and one dermatosarcoma), and meningiomas (n = 6). All eight breast carcinomas occurred after the treatment of childhood Hodgkin disease. Of the 37 patients with SNs, 12 died of either the SN (n = 10) or of recurrent disease (n = 2). Risk factors associated with developing a SN included initial diagnosis of Hodgkin disease (P = 0.0003), female gender (P = 0.008), and an initial diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the radiation-treated cohort experienced increased mortality, were at an increased risk of developing an SN, and should undergo increased medical surveillance as adults. The cumulative probability of developing an SN has increased substantially at 30 years, largely due to an increase in follow-up time. In addition, the cumulative probability curve does not show evidence of plateau after increased duration of follow-up. Finally, the emergence of secondary breast carcinoma in the current study was not noted in the previous analysis.","['Gold, Douglas G', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn E']","['Gold DG', 'Neglia JP', 'Dusenbery KE']","['University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors', 'Time Factors']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11356 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 May 15;97(10):2588-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11356.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11356'],,,,,,,,,['Cancer. 2004 Jan 1;100(1):212-3.

METHODS: Patients with Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC, a performance status (PS) score of 0-1, and no history of chemotherapy exposure were eligible. Paclitaxel, 150 mg/m(2), was administered over 3 hours during Weeks 1-6 of an 8-week cycle. Doses were modified for ANC < 1500/microL or for >or= Grade 2 neuropathy on the day of therapy. Treatment continued until toxicity or disease progression. Pharmacokinetics were assessed at Weeks 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 1. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (median age, 64 years; range, 31-81 years) were treated. There were 21 males (PS = 0 for 17). Eleven patients had received previous radiation, 2 had brain metastases, 25 had adenocarcinoma, 23 had Stage IV disease, 6 had StageIIIB disease, and 9 had recurrent disease. Grade 3-4 granulocytopenia occurred in 39% of patients. There were no deaths due to toxicity. Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy occurred in 29% and 24% of patients, respectively. Ten (27%) patients had Grade 3 hyperglycemia (glucose concentration > 250 mg/dL). There were 16 partial responses (42%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26-59%). The median survival period was 12.3 months (95% CI, 7.9-19.6%), and the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 52% (95% CI, 39-71%) and 26% (95% CI, 15-45%), respectively. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics were consistent with published values and clearance was not induced. Older age and hyperglycemia were associated with greater neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel at 150 mg/m(2) per week x 6 every 8 weeks can be administered safely in the cooperative group setting. These Phase II data are comparable to those associated with combination therapy. The weekly dose-dense schedule may be more active than conventional schedules.","['Akerley, Wallace', 'Herndon, James E', 'Egorin, Merrill J', 'Lyss, Alan P', 'Kindler, Hedy L', 'Savarese, Dianne M', 'Sherman, Carol A', 'Rosen, D Marc', 'Hollis, Donna', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Green, Mark R']","['Akerley W', 'Herndon JE', 'Egorin MJ', 'Lyss AP', 'Kindler HL', 'Savarese DM', 'Sherman CA', 'Rosen DM', 'Hollis D', 'Ratain MJ', 'Green MR']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84103, USA. wallace.akerley@HCI.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11375 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 May 15;97(10):2480-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11375.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11375'],,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA0392/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred seven consecutive patients were evaluated prospectively for AVN. They survived disease free for more than 180 days after autologous or allogeneic SCT for hematologic malignancies. The diagnosis of AVN in suspicious cases was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Possible correlations with treatments, bone mineral density (BMD), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and in vitro growth of fibroblast progenitors were investigated. Bone mineral density was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 100 transplanted patients, and the in vitro growth of fibroblast progenitors was monitored by a fibroblast colony-forming unit (CFU-F) assay in 30 patients after allogeneic SCT. RESULTS: Twelve patients developed AVN 3-114 months (median, 26 months) following SCT: 10 (10%) after allogeneic SCT and 2 (1.9%) after autologous SCT (P = 0.04). Twenty-five joints were affected by AVN. All patients had femoral head involvement, which was managed with hip replacement in six of them. All but one patient who developed AVN after allogeneic SCT suffered from chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Avascular necrosis occurred 1-4 months after exacerbation or progression of cGVHD. Cumulative dose of steroids was similar in both SCT groups (including steroids given pretransplant for the basic disease), whereas treatment duration was significantly longer in the allogeneic SCT group. Avascular necrosis was related to the decreased number of bone marrow CFU-F colonies in vitro, but not to BMD values. CONCLUSIONS: Avascular necrosis is a skeletal complication that occurs more often after allogeneic than after autologous SCT. Occurrence of AVN symptoms after clinical follow-up of cGVHD suggests that cGVHD requiring long-term steroid therapy is one of the main risk factors for AVN. Avascular necrosis may be facilitated by a severe deficit in the repopulating capacity of bone marrow stromal stem cells after SCT.","['Tauchmanova, Libuse', 'De Rosa, Gennaro', 'Serio, Bianca', 'Fazioli, Flavio', 'Mainolfi, Ciro', 'Lombardi, Gaetano', 'Colao, Annamaria', 'Salvatore, Marco', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Selleri, Carmine']","['Tauchmanova L', 'De Rosa G', 'Serio B', 'Fazioli F', 'Mainolfi C', 'Lombardi G', 'Colao A', 'Salvatore M', 'Rotoli B', 'Selleri C']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology and Oncology, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Density', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*epidemiology/*etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Survivors']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11373 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 May 15;97(10):2453-61. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11373.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11373'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database of 10.2 million individuals, which includes 19,128 invasive endometrial carcinomas and 19,440 ovarian carcinomas, was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for second primary carcinomas. SIRs were calculated for specific follow-up periods. Data on histopathologic types also were used. RESULTS: An excess of subsequent malignancies after women were diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma was noted at 11 sites. The highest SIRs were recorded for synchronous or metasynchronous ovarian carcinomas (SIR, 55.77; 95% CI, 48.82-63.43) and carcinomas of the small intestines (SIR, 14.71; 95% CI, 4.64-34.59). Primary ovarian carcinoma was followed by an increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma, and the risks of developing many other malignancies also were increased after women were diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma, including intestinal malignancies, renal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, squamous cell skin carcinoma, connective tissue malignancies, and leukemia. When ovarian endometrioid histology was diagnosed synchronously with primary endometrial carcinoma, the SIR was 140; when endometrial carcinoma was the subsequent neoplasm, the SIR was 87. A small familial component was found in the cooccurrence of endometrial carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The current data show a strong clustering of endometrial carcinomas and ovarian carcinomas, particularly involving tumors of endometrioid morphology. The patterns of second neoplasms also suggest that hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma may contribute to the association between endometrial and ovarian malignancies. Increased risks for connective tissue tumors and leukemia may signal a response to treatment, and an increased risk for squamous cell skin carcinoma may signal a depressed immune function.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Aaltonen, Lauri', 'Li, Xinjun']","['Hemminki K', 'Aaltonen L', 'Li X']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. kari.hemminki@cnt.ki.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Endometrioid/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Whites/genetics']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11372 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 May 15;97(10):2432-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11372.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11372'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the time course, natural history, and histopathology of thyroid lesions that develop after high-dose irradiation, the authors undertook a retrospective study of all survivors of childhood and adolescent malignancies who were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and who developed a clinically apparent thyroid neoplasm. METHODS: The authors searched the data base of the Department of Pediatrics, the hospital-based tumor registry, and the hospital medical records database for patients with thyroid neoplasms. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were identified who developed a thyroid neoplasm after therapeutic radiation. Primary diagnoses were Hodgkin disease (n = 18 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 10 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1 patient), Wilms tumor (n = 1 patient), and neuroblastoma (n = 1 patient). The median age at the time of diagnosis of the primary malignancy was 12.0 years (range, 3.7-18.3 years), the median radiation dose to the thyroid gland was 2400 centigrays (cGy; range, 1000-4200 cGy), and the median interval from the time of radiation therapy until the recognition of thyroid disease was 13.0 years (range, 6.2-30.1 years). Thirteen of 33 thyroid lesions (39%) were malignant (11 papillary carcinomas and 2 follicular carcinomas). Age at diagnosis, gender ratio, and time elapsed since initial treatment did not differ between patients with malignant and benign lesions, but the median radiation dose to the thyroid was lower in patients who had malignant disease compared with patients who had benign disease (2000 cGy vs. 2950 cGy; P = 0.03). Disease was confined to the neck in all patients who had malignant thyroid lesions; after a median follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 0.9-12 years), none of the patients developed progressive or recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study suggest that a high proportion of clinically apparent thyroid neoplasms that develop after therapeutic radiation for a childhood malignancy are malignant. However, most of these thyroid malignancies do not appear to behave in an aggressive fashion. Because thyroid neoplasms may not become evident for decades after radiation therapy, all individuals who are at risk require life-long follow-up.","['Acharya, Suchitra', 'Sarafoglou, Kyriakie', 'LaQuaglia, Michael', 'Lindsley, Skyler', 'Gerald, William', 'Wollner, Norma', 'Tan, Charlotte', 'Sklar, Charles']","['Acharya S', 'Sarafoglou K', 'LaQuaglia M', 'Lindsley S', 'Gerald W', 'Wollner N', 'Tan C', 'Sklar C']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Presbyterian Hospital and Cornell-Weil Medical School, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adenoma/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/radiotherapy', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Wilms Tumor/radiotherapy']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11362 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 May 15;97(10):2397-403. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11362.,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11362'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proof and exact quantification of MF is not yet standardized, thus impeding the comparability of results and the evaluation of its prognostic impact. In this study on 360 bone marrow biopsy specimens from 135 patients with either chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) (evaluation group) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (test group), marked differences were detected between six different approaches systematically compared with respect to proof and quantification of MF. A new volumetric approach quantifying the marrow volume affected by fibrosis turned out to be superior to all of the other morphometric methods considering practicability and specificity of results, and superior to a semiquantitative procedure considering sensitivity, precision, and reproducibility (P < 0.00005). The assessment of the marrow volume with fibrosis was the only feature of MF independently influencing the survival time of patients (test group with CML; multivariate analysis, P = 0.0008). We conclude that an approach estimating the marrow volume affected by fibrosis is the method of choice to exactly quantify and prove MF. The loss of marrow volume due to fibrosis appears to be crucial with respect to the prognostic significance of MF in CML.

Experimental Design: Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of methylyl carbamate (98% pure) were conducted by exposing groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice by gavage in water in a single dose and by repeated administration for 16 days, 13 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years. In addition, short-term mutagenicity studies in bacteria, mammalian cells, and Drosophila and of unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver cells were conducted. Single-Administration Studies: In the single-administration studies, 5/5 male and 5/5 female rats that received 8,000 mg/kg methyl carbamate and 2/5 male and 5/5 female that received 4,000 mg/kg died before the end of the 15-day observational period. Five of five male and 5/5 female mice that received 8,000 mg/kg and 1/5 females that received 4,000 mg/kg died before the end of the 15-day observational period. No compound-related morphologic effects were observed in rats or mice that received 2,000 mg/kg. Sixteen-Day Studies: In the 16-day studies, all rats dosed at 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg died, and 3/5 male rats that received 1,000 mg/kg died. Male mice that received 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg, female mice that received 4,000 mg/kg, and 1/5 female mice that received 2,000 mg/kg died. No compound-related gross pathologic or histopathologic effects were seen in male or female rats (groups of five each) that received 500 mg/kg or in mice that received 1,000 mg/kg. Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female rats and mice received up to 800 mg/kg (male rats), 1,000 mg/kg (female rats), 1,500 mg/kg (male mice), or 2,000 mg/kg (female mice). Four of 10 male rats that received 800 mg/kg and 1/10 female rats that received 1,000 mg/kg died of compound-related causes before the end of the studies. Toxic hepatitis, splenic pigmentation, bone marrow atrophy, and testicular atrophy were observed in the two highest dose groups of rats. One of the female mice that received 2,000 mg/kg died. The dosed female mice had significantly greater liver weights than did the vehicle controls. Experimental Design of Six-, Twelve-, and Eighteen-Month and Two-Year Studies: Based on the findings in the short-term studies, 2-year studies of methyl carbamate were conducted by administering 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg methyl carbamate in distilled water by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex were administered 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg methyl carbamate on the same schedule. Additional groups of 30 rats of each sex were administered 0 or 400 mg/kg methyl carbamate, and additional groups of 30 mice of each sex were administered 0 or 1,000 mg/kg methyl carbamate in distilled water by gavage, 5 days per week. Ten animals from each group were killed at 6, 12, or 18 months so that the progression of lesions could be followed. Results of the Six-, Twelve-, and Eighteen-Month and Two-Year Studies: In the 6-month studies, all vehicle control and dosed (400 mg/kg) rats survived. Cytologic alterations and atypical proliferative changes were observed in the liver of all dosed male and female rats, and neoplastic nodules of the liver were observed in 6/10 dosed male and 5/10 dosed female rats. In the 12-month studies, all vehicle control male and female rats and dosed female rats survived. One of 10 dosed male rats died. Neoplastic nodules of the liver were observed in 7/10 dosed male and 9/10 dosed female rats, and hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in 8/10 dosed male and 6/10 dosed female rats. In the 18-month studies, 1/10 dosed male and 8/10 dosed female and all vehicle control rats survived. Hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in 9/10 dosed male and 8/10 dosed female rats. Compound-related neoplastic changes were not observed in mice in the 6-, 12-, or 18-month studies. In the 2-year studar studies, mean body weights of high dose (200 mg/kg) male rats were generally 5&percnt;-9&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 20. Mean body weights of high dose female rats were 5&percnt;-8&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 56. Survival of dosed and vehicle control rats was similar (male: vehicle control, 19/50; low dose, 26/50; high dose, 29/50; female: 29/50; 36/50; 35/50). The mean body weights of high dose (1,000 mg/kg) male mice were about 8&percnt;-18&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 24. The mean body weights of high dose (1,000 mg/kg) female mice were about 16&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 16 and 30&percnt; lower after week 64. Survival of dosed and vehicle control mice was similar (male: 28/50; 35/50; 28/50; female: 38/50; 36/50; 32/50). Chronic focal inflammation and cytologic alteration of the liver were observed at increased incidences in high dose rats of each sex. Hyperplasia of hepatocytes was observed atincreased incidences in dosed male and high dose female rats. Neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas (combined) in female rats occurred with a significant positive trend (0/50; 0/50; 6/49; P&lt;0.01); the incidence of neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas (combined) in high dose female rats was greater (P&lt;0.03) than that in the vehicle controls. Incidences of liver neoplasms in dosed male rats were not significantly increased (4/50; 0/50; 7/49). Inflammation of the harderian gland was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 4/50; 11/50; 16/50; female: 7/50; 16/50; 30/50). The lesions were considered to be chemically related. In the 2-year studies in rats, significant decreases in tumor incidences included the following: leukemia (both sexes), pituitary gland (male), adrenal gland (male), and mammary gland (female). In the 2-year mouse studies, multinucleate giant cells in the liver were observed at increased incidences in dosed male mice (14/50; 31/50; 31/49). Adenomatous hyperplasia and histiocytosis of the lung were observed at increased incidences in high dose mice (adenomatous hyperplasia--male: 13/50; 19/50; 24/49; female: 7/49; 10/50; 18/50; histiocytosis--male: 11/50; 7/50; 21/49; female: 9/49; 10/50; 21/50). Genetic Toxicology: Methyl carbamate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 when tested with or without metabolic activation in a preincubation protocol at doses up to 10 mg/plate. Methyl carbamate did not induce forward mutations in the mouse L5178Y/TK&plusmn; lymphoma assay with or without metabolicactivation at doses up to 5 mg/ml. Unscheduled DNA synthesis was not detected in rat hepatocytes after in vitro treatment with methyl carbamate at concentrations of 1.0-1,000 ug/ml. When tested in Drosophila at doses of 25,000-50,000 ppm, methyl carbamate did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations. Results of tests for induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges by methyl carbamate in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells were also negative at doses up to 5 mg/ml. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 6-, 12-, and 18-month and 2-year studies of methyl carbamate. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 6-, 12-, and 18-month and 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female F344/N rats given methyl carbamate as indicated by increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinomas. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female B6C3F1 mice given methyl carbamate at doses of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg. Methyl carbamate also induced inflammation of the harderian gland in male and female rats and adenomatous hyperplasia and histiocytosis of the lung in male and female mice.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering 4-hexylresorcinol (greater than 99% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Sixteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 16-day studies, groups of five rats and five mice of each sex were administered 0, 31.3, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg 4-hexylresorcinol. Survival was not affected. Decreased body weights were seen in male rats that received 250 or 500 mg/kg 4-hexylresorcinol. No other effects were observed. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were administered 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg of the chemical, 5 days per week. All rats and male mice and 9/10 female mice that received 1,000 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of male rats that received 250 or 500 mg/kg were 22% or 38% lower than that of the vehicle controls; final mean body weights of female rats that received 250 or 500 mg/kg were 16% or 9% lower. No compound-related gross or microscopic pathologic effects were observed in rats. No body weight effects were observed for mice. Mild to moderate nephropathy was dose related in male and female mice. Based on these results, 2-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 4-hexylresorcinol were conducted by administering 0, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg to groups of 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex, 5 days per week. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male rats were 7%-11% lower than those of the vehicle controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of low dose male and dosed female rats were similar to those of the vehicle controls. The body weights of dosed male and dosed female mice were comparable to those of vehicle controls except during the last 16 weeks of the studies, when body weights were 6%-16% lower in the dosed groups. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats or mice of either sex (male rats: vehicle control, 30/50; low dose, 29/50; high dose, 33/50; female rats: 28/50; 32/50; 30/50; male mice: 36/50; 26/50; 30/50; female mice: 35/50; 32/50; 35/50). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Lesions in the Two-Year Studies: Two astrocytomas and an oligodendroglioma were observed in high dose male rats, a glioma was observed in one low dose male rat, and an oligodendroglioma was observed in one vehicle control male rat. These neoplasms were not considered to be related to 4-hexylresorcinol administration. Focal medullary hyperplasia of the adrenal gland was observed at increased incidences in dosed male mice (5/50; 16/50; 10/49). Pheochromocytomas in male mice occurred with a marginal upward trend (1/50; 2/50; 5/49). Historically, these neoplasms are observed in about 1% of corn oil vehicle control B6C3F1 male mice. The incidences of neoplasms of the harderian gland in male mice were slightly increased over those in the vehicle controls (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: 0/50; 4/50; 3/50). Decreases were observed in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in dosed male (12/49; 7/50; 1/50) and female (16/50; 3/50; 2/50) rats, hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in dosed male mice (21/50; 9/50; 9/50), and circulatory system tumors in male (10/50; 4/50; 2/50) and female (6/50; 2/49; 0/50) mice. These decreased incidences of tumors in rats and mice are considered to be possibly related to 4-hexylresorcinol administration. The incidences and severity of nephropathy (male: 39/50; 43/50; 47/50; female: 7/50; 40/49; 47/50) and incidences of osteosclerosis (male: 5/50; 5/50; 15/50; female: 21/50; 25/49; 40/50) were increased in both dosed male and female mice and are considered to be related to chemical exposure. Genetic Toxicology: 4-Hexylresorcinol was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without S9 metabolic activation. 4-Hexylre, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without S9 metabolic activation. 4-Hexylresorcinol induced forward mutations at the TK locus in mouse L5178Y cells in the presence of S9; no response was observed in the absence of metabolic activation. In cytogenetic assays with cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 4-hexylresorcinol caused an increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in the absence of metabolic activation; no induction of SCEs was observed in the presence of S9. Chromosomal aberrations were not induced in CHO cells with or without metabolic activation. Data Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of 4-hexylresorcinol were audited at the NTP Archives. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented appropriately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-hexylresorcinol for male or female F344/N rats given doses of 62.5 or 125 mg/kg. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-hexylresorcinol for male B6C3F1 mice, as shown by marginally increased incidences of pheochromocytomas (and hyperplasia) of the adrenal medulla and of harderian gland neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice given doses of 62.5 or 125 mg/kg 4-hexylresorcinol. Decreased incidences of three tumors types were considered related to 4-hexylresorcinol administration: mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats, hepatocellular neoplasms in male mice, and circulatory system tumors in male and female mice.

Sixteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: In 16-day studies, mean body weight gains of rats receiving 2,500 mg/kg were 6-7 g lower than those of vehicle controls; 4/5 male and 5/5 female mice dosed with 3,000 mg/kg and 4/5 female mice dosed with 1,500 mg/kg died; lethargy and prostration occurred in most of these animals after gavage. Based on these results, doses were selected for both species in the 13-week studies were 0, 94 (mice only), 188, 375, 750, and 1,500 mg/kg. In the 13-week studies, no chemical-related deaths occurred in rats, but body weight gains in males dosed with 1,500 mg/kg and in females dosed with 750 or 1,500 mg/kg were lower than those in the vehicle control groups. Hepatomegaly occurred at the two highest doses in males and at all doses in females; however, no microscopic pathologic changes were noted in any tissue. More than half the mice dosed with 1,500 mg/kg died, but no compound-related body weight changes occurred. Clinical signs in mice were dose related and included lethargy in animals dosed with 375 mg/kg and lacrimation, salivation, and clonic seizure in some dosed with 750 or 1,500 mg/kg. No association between these clinical signs of toxicity and gross or microscopic pathologic effects were observed. Doses selected for the 2-year studies were 0, 375, and 750 mg/kg for male rats and for mice of each sex and 0, 188, or 375 mg/kg for female rats. Body weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Fifty animals of each species and sex were administered 2-mercaptobenzothiazole in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Administration of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole resulted in decreased survival in dosed male rats (vehicle control, 42/50; low dose, 22/50; high dose, 20/50) and in the high dose group of female mice (37/50; 39/50; 22/50) but not in female rats (28/50; 31/50; 25/50) or in male mice (38/50; 33/50; 30/50). No effect on body weight gain in dosed rats was observed; in dosed mice, minor reductions occurred between weeks 3 and 64, withrecovery thereafter. Postgavage lethargy and prostration occurred frequently in dosed rats and mice. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The severity of nephropathy was increased in dosed male rats. Ulcers and inflammation of the forestomach were prevalent in dosed rats, as were increased incidences of epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in male rats, but no neoplasms of the forestomach were observed. There were no increases of nonneoplastic lesions in mice which were considered to be compound related. The incidences of a variety of tumors were increased in rats dosed with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole; some of the increased incidences were not dose related. In low dose male rats, increased incidences (P<0.01) were observed for mononuclear cell leukemia (7/50; 16/50; 3/50) and pancreatic acinar cell adenomas (2/50; 13/50; 6/49). Increased tumor incidences with dose-related trends (P<0.05) included pituitary gland adenomas in females (15/49; 24/50; 25/50), preputial gland adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in males (1/50; 6/50; 5/50), adrenal gland pheochromocytomas or malignant pheochromocytomas (combined) in males (18/50; 27/50; 24/49), and pheochromocytomas in females (1/50; 5/50; 6/50). These tumors were observed at significantly greater incidences (P</=0.05) in the high dose groups than in the vehicle controls. An increased incidence (P=0.028) of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) was observed only in low dose female mice (4/50; 12/49; 4/50). No significant increases in tumor incidences were seen in male mice. Genetic Toxicology: 2-Mercaptobenzothgy: 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without metabolic activation. In the presence of rat liver S9, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, as well as mutations at the TK locus of mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole were audited at the NTP Archives. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole for male F344/N rats, indicated by increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia, pancreatic acinar cell adenomas, adrenal gland pheochromocytomas, and preputial gland adenomas or carcinomas (combined). There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, indicated by increased incidences of adrenal gland pheochromocytomas and pituitary gland adenomas.

Additional reasons for selection included it structural similarity and possible metabolism to the known human urinary bladder carcinogen, 2-naphthylamine. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by feeding diets containing N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine (approximately 98% pure and containing less than 1 ppm 2-naphthylamine) at various concentrations to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Fourteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: In 14-day studies, 3/5 male and 4/5 female rats that received 50,000 ppm N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of rats that received 12,500 ppm or more were considerably lower (18%-57%) than those of the controls. Arched backs, rough coats, and diarrhea were observed for males that received 12,500 ppm or more and for females that received 25,000 or 50,000 ppm. All mice were alive at the end of the studies, and no compound-related clinical signs of toxicity were observed in mice given feed containing up to 20,000 ppm. In 13-week studies, deaths occurred in 4/10 male and 9/10 female rats that received the highest dose (40,000 ppm) of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine. Final mean body weights of rats that received 5,000-40,000 ppm were 9%-60% lower than those of the controls. The liver weight to body weight ratios increased with increasing dose, with the ratios for male rats at 10,000 ppm or more and for female rats at 5,000 ppm being greater (P<0.05) than those of controls. A compound-related nephropathy occurred in rats and was characterized by renal tubular epithelial degeneration and hyperplasia. Other effects in rats included hematopoietic hypoplasia or atrophy of the femoral bone marrow, testicular hypospermatogenesis, lymphoid degeneration of the thymus, and lymphoid depletion of the spleen. In mice, 2/10 males and 7/10 females that received 40,000 ppm died before the end of the 13-week studies. The final mean body weights of mice that received 10,000, 20,000, or 40,000 ppm were 9%-32% lower than those of the controls. The liver weight to body weight ratios for mice increased with increasing dose. Those for male mice at 10,000 ppm or more and for female mice at 20,000 ppm or more were greater (P<0.05) than those for the controls. Nephropathywas observed at increased incidences and severity in dosed mice. Because of kidney lesions, liver enlargement, lower weight gain, and increased mortality in the shorter term studies, dietary concentrations of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine selected for the 2-year studies in rats and mice were 0, 2,5000, and 5,000 ppm. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: The mean body weights of dosed rats were lower than those of the controls throughout the studies (12% and 16% lower for dosed males and 15% and 31% lower for dosed females at the end of the studies). The average daily feed consumption for rats was 94%-87% that of the controls for dosed males and 88% that of the controls for dosed females. The estimated average amount of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine consumed per day was 100 mg/kg and 225 mg/kg for male rats and 120 mg/kg and 260 mg/kg for female rats. The survival of the high dose group of male rats was greater (P<0.05) than that of the controls after week 101 (male: control, 24/50; low dose, 28/50; high dose, 34/50; female: 26/50; 44/50; 38/50). Final mean body weights of high dose male and female mice were lower (male, 9%; female, 23%) than those of the controls. The estimated average daily feed consumption by dosed mice was within 10% that of the controls. The average amount of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine consumed per day was approximately 500 or 1,000 mg/kg for male mice and 450 or 900 mg/kg for female mice. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of mice of either sex (male: control, 33/50; male mice. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of mice of either sex (male: control, 33/50; low dose, 36/50; high dose, 28/50; female: 36/50; 30/50; 35/50). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: As in the 13-week studies, the kidney was the principal target for toxic effects of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine. Mineralization of the kidney, necrosis of the renal papilla, and epithelial hyperplasia and calculi of the kidney pelvis were observed at increased incidences in high dose female rats. Hydronephrosis, atrophy, fibrosis, and chronic focal inflammation of the kidney were observed at increased incidences in high dose female rats. Cysts and acute suppurative inflammation of the kidney were observed at increased incidences in dosed male and high dose female rats. No compound-related renal neoplasms were observed in rats. Nuclear enlargement of renal tubular epithelial cells and nephropathy were observed at increased incidences in high dose female mice. Atypical tubular cell hyperplasia occurred in two high dose female mice. A tubular cell adenoma was found in one high dose female mouse, and a tubular cell adenocarcinoma was found in another high dose female mouse. No renal neoplasms were observed in dosed male mice. Neoplasms of several organs occurred in rats with negative trends and/or at significantly lower incidences in high dose groups. These included thyroid gland C-cell neoplasms in males and females and mammary gland fibroadenomas, pituitary gland adenomas, and mononuclear cell leukemia in females. The lack of carcinogenicity in rats may be related to an inability to metabolize this compound to the known animal and human carcinogen 2-napththylamine. Genetic Toxicity: N-Phenyl-2-naphthylamine was not mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium/microsome assay with strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 with or without induced hamster or rat liver S9. The chemical did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with or without metabolic activation. No increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) was observed in the absence of metabolic activation; in the presence of rat liver S9, the SCE results were judged to be equivocal. Data Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine were audited at the NTP Archives. The audit findings show thatthe conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female F344/N rats fed diets containing 2,500 or 5,000 ppm N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine. Decreased incidences of several neoplasms were observed in dosed rats: thyroid gland C-cell neoplasms in males and females and mononuclear cell leukemia, pituitary gland adenomas, and mammary gland fibroadenomas in females. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 2,500 or 5,000 ppm N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine for female B6C3F1 mice as indicated by the occurrence of two rare kidney neoplasms. Chemical-related nonneoplastic lesions (nephropathy, karyomegaly, and hyperplasia) occurred in the kidney of rats and mice.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by feeding diets containing nitrofurazone (99% pure) to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Fourteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: Groups of five males and five females of each species were fed diets containing 0, 630, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm for 14 consecutive days. Early deaths occurred in all groups of rats receiving 5,000 or 10,000 ppm nitrofurazone. The surviving rats in the lower two dose groups gained weight, but weight gain was decreased as the dose of nitrofurazone was increased. Feed consumption by rats of each sex was decreased at all doses above 630 ppm. In all dosed groups, clinical signs of toxicity included rough hair coats and lethargy. At doses of 2,500 ppm and above, rats of each sex exhibited intermittent episodes of seizures and lethargy. All mice that received 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm nitrofurazone and 3/5 males that received 1,250 ppm died before the end of the 14-day studies; the surviving dosed mice (except females at 630 ppm) lost weight. A dose-related decrease in feed consumption was observed at all doses above 630 ppm. Clinical signs included rough hair coats and convulsive seizures. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 rats of each sex were given diets containing 0, 150, 310, 620, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm nitrofurazone. No deaths were observed and all animals gained weight, but the magnitude of weight gain was dose dependent with decrements in final mean body weight for the highest dose group reaching 55% in males and 36% in females. Other evidence of chemically related toxicity included convulsive seizures, osteoporosis, degenerative arthropathy, and gonadal hypoplasia in both sexes at the two highest doses. Groups of 10 mice of each sex were given diets containing 0, 70, 150, 310, 620, or 1,250 ppm nitrofurazone for 13 weeks. Early deaths were observed in the two highest dose groups of each sex. The final mean body weights of male and female mice in the 1,250-ppm groups were about 20% lower than those of the controls; weight gains of the other dosed mice were comparable to those of the controls. Stimulus-induced convulsive seizures were observed for all mice in the two highest dose groups. Testicular hypoplasia was observed in the two highest dose groups of male mice. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Dietary concentrations for the 2-year studies were 0, 310, or 620 ppm for rats and 0, 150, or 310 ppm for mice (50 animals per dose group). Mean body weights of high dose male rats were lower than those of the controls after week 39; mean body weights of low dose male rats and of the controls were comparable throughout the study. Final mean body weights of low and high dose female rats were 9% and 21% lower than those of the controls. Dosed rats consumed less feed than did the controls. The average amount of nitrofurazone consumed per day was approximately 11-12 or 24-26 mg/kg by low or high dose male and female rats. The survival of the high dose group of male rats was lower than that of the controls after week 92 (final survival-- male: control, 33/50; low dose, 30/50; high dose, 20/50; female: 28/50; 37/50; 31/50). Mean body weights of dosed mice were similar to or somewhat greater than those of controls throughout most of the studies. The average daily feed consumption by dosed mice was similar to that of controls. The average amount of nitrofurazone consumed per day was approximately 14-16 or 29-33 mg/kg for low or high dose male and female mice. The survival of the high dose group of male mice was lower than that of the controls after week 88 (final survival-- male: 39/50; 31/50; 27/50; female: 39/50; 40/50; 35/50). In mice of each sex, nitrofurazone administration induced stimulus-sensitive convulsive seizures beginning at week 4 or 5 for high dose mice and week 24 for low dose female mice. These seizures were low dose female mice. These seizures were observed primarily in the first year of the study. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Degenerative changes involving the vertebral and femoro-tibial (knee) joints were observed at increased incidences in dosed rats. The degenerative changes primarily affected the articular cartilage and were similar to those seen in the 13-week studies. Degeneration of the sternal synchondroses was increased in high dose female rats. The osteoporosis seen in the 13-week studies was not observed in the 2-year studies. Testicular degeneration, characterized by atrophy of the germinal epithelium and aspermatogenesis, was observed at increased incidences in dosed male rats (control, 12/50; low dose, 49/50; high dose, 47/50). Adenomas of the sebaceous glands and trichoepitheliomas or sebaceous adenomas (combined) of the skin were observed in high dose male rats (0/50; 0/50; 5/50). Carcinomas of the preputial gland were increased in dosed male rats (1/50; 8/50; 5/50). The incidences of preputial gland adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in dosed male rats were not statistically greater than that in the controls (9/50; 16/50; 7/50). However, in the low dose group, the incidence is greater than the highest incidence observed in historical untreated control groups (9/50). In addition, hyperplasia of the preputial gland was observed in six low dose male rats in which neither adenomas nor carcinomas occurred. The incidence of mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis in low dose male rats was greater than that in the controls (0/50; 7/50; 2/50). Fibroadenomas of the mammary gland occurred at markedly increased incidences in dosed female rats (8/49; 36/50; 36/50). Three adenocarcinomas were also observed (1/49; 0/50; 2/50). Ovarian atrophy (7/47; 44/50; 38/50) and tubular cell hyperplasia of the ovary (1/47; 23/50; 21/50) were observed at markedly increased incidences in dosed female mice. The incidences of benign mixed tumors (0/47; 17/50; 20/50), granulosa cell tumors (1/47; 4/50; 9/50), and granulosa cell tumors or luteomas (combined) (3/47; 6/50; 9/50) of the ovary were increased in exposed female mice. Mononuclear cell leukemia in rats occurred with negative trends (male: 21/50; 23/50; 6/50; female: 15/49; 2/50; 2/50). In female mice, the incidences of adenomas or carcinomas (combined) of the anterior pituitary gland occurred with a negative trend (10/50; 7/50; 2/49). The incidences of testicular interstitial cell tumors were decreased in dosed male rats (45/50; 30/50; 28/50). Genetic Toxicity: Nitrofurazone was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 both with and without exogenous metabolic activation. The responses in strains TA1535 and TA1537 were more varied: nitrofurazone was mutagenic in strain TA1535 only in the presence of S9 and produced no consistent increase in gene reversions in strain TA1537 with or without S9. In the absence of metabolic activation, nitrofurazone induced forward mutations at the TK+/- locus of mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells; the chemical was not tested with S9. Treatment of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with nitrofurazone in the absence of S9 produced a dose-related increase in sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations; with S9, sister chromatid exchanges were increased, but no induction of chromosomal aberrations was observed. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of nitrofurazone were audited at the NTP Archives. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurazone for male F344/N rats as shown by the occurrence of sebaceous gland adenomas and trichoepitheliomas of the skin, mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis, and preputial gland tumors. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurazone for female F344/N rats as shown by a markedly increased incidence of fibroadenomas of the mammary gland. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing nitrofurazone at concentrations of 150 or 310 ppm. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurazone for female B6C3F1 mice as shown by increased incidences of benign mixed tumors and granulosa cell tumors of the ovary. Administration of nitrofurazone was associated with decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats, testicular interstitial cell tumors in male rats, and pituitary gland neoplasms in female mice. Convulsive seizures in mice of each sex, ovarian atrophy in female mice, testicular degeneration in rats, and degeneration of articular cartilage in rats were all associated with the administration of nitrofurazone.

We retrospectively evaluated the persistence of anti-HAV in a nonvaccinated population that underwent PSCT. Serum detection of anti-HAV was determined before and after PSCT using a qualitative commercially available enzyme immunoassay. From January 1997 to March 2001, 136 (68%) of 201 patients tested (+) for anti-HAV prior to PSCT. Subsequent investigation of anti-HAV was possible in 36 of these patients at a median of 12 months after PSCT. The median age of patients was 47 years old; they had diagnoses of hematological malignancies (33) and solid tumors (three), and underwent autologous (31) and allogenic (five) PSCT. A total of 31 (86%) of 36 patients remained anti-HAV (+) and five (14%) became (-) after PSCT. The variables age, sex, diagnosis, type of PSCT, time of testing, and number of CD34 cells infused were not predictors of loss of anti-HAV.

Furthermore, the requirement for post-transplant immunosuppression following extensive T-cell depletion remains unclear. We therefore evaluated the role of cyclosporine (CSA) in recipients of HLA-identical T-cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT), followed by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) scheduled on days +45 and +100. Before day+45, successive cohorts of patients received decreasing amounts of CSA: standard-dose (SD) CSA, low-dose (LD) CSA, or no CSA until day+45. LD CSA was as effective as SD CSA in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, moderate-to-severe acute GVHD was significantly more frequent before the day +45 DLI in patients receiving no CSA (33.3 vs 12.7%, P=0.036, including the only four grade III-IV cases). As a result of higher rates of early acute GVHD, more patients in the 'no CSA' group failed to receive any DLI (30.7 vs 7.1%, P=0.01).

Similarly, no significant differences were found in chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality, or survival.

Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is increasingly being recognised as the treatment of choice in eligible patients with Ph(+)ALL, but disease-relapse remains a problem in a proportion of patients prior to and after SCT. Genetic abnormalities in addition to the Ph chromosome may influence the biology and clinical course of ALL, but there are not many studies on the potential genetic heterogeneity of adult Ph(+)ALL and clinical outcomes. Here, we report on five patients with ALL who were double Ph(+) and also had a high-hyperdiploid karyotype (Ph(+)/hyperdiploid) at diagnosis. In contrast to the presence of the Ph(+) chromosome, high-hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) as the sole karyotypic abnormality in ALL is associated with a favourable clinical outcome. In our series, four patients with a Ph(+)/hyperdiploid karyotype achieved a cytogenetic remission after induction chemotherapy and proceeded to stem cell transplantation (SCT). The fifth had five subclones including Ph(+)/hyperdiploid, as well as those that were only Ph(+); the latter emerged as the dominant clone after induction therapy and the patient died of disease-relapse. Of the patients who underwent SCT, only one relapsed, but achieved a durable remission with donor lymphocyte infusions. Thus, it is conceivable that the presence of high-hyperdiploidy as an additional karyotypic abnormality may confer a better prognosis to Ph(+)ALL, presumably by altering the kinetics of Ph(+) neoplastic cells. We have discussed these results in the context of recent studies on the significance of high-hyperdiploidy in Ph(+) adult ALL.","['Tauro, S', 'McMullan, D', 'Griffiths, M', 'Craddock, C', 'Mahendra, P']","['Tauro S', 'McMullan D', 'Griffiths M', 'Craddock C', 'Mahendra P']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2004/02/21 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703913 [doi]', '1703913 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 May;31(9):763-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703913.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of ASCT in first remission patients remains controversial. Phase II and phase III studies demonstrate that patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics benefit from ASCT, with reduction in relapse and improvement in leukemia-free survival (LFS). Patients with poor-risk cytogenetics do not appear to benefit significantly from ASCT and should preferentially be treated with allogeneic transplant. The role of ASCT for patients with intermediate risk disease is uncertain. It appears that ASCT in first remission will improve disease-free survival compared to standard chemotherapy. Sufficient patients who relapse after chemotherapy treatment can be salvaged with ASCT in second remission such that the beneficial effect on overall survival is blunted. ASCT produces equivalent results to ABMT but with reduced morbidity. The collection of stem cells during recovery from intensive dose consolidation therapy appears to be an attractive strategy that can increase the percentage of patients who are able to receive their intended transplant. Consolidation therapy prior to stem cell collection and transplant has been shown to decrease the relapse rate and improve outcomes, but the optimal nature of this consolidation therapy is unknown. For patients with AML in second remission, ABMT/ASCT offers a substantial salvage rate, and is particularly effective for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Linker, C A']",['Linker CA'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",55,2003/05/07 05:00,2004/02/21 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704020 [doi]', '1704020 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 May;31(9):731-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients without a matched sibling donor, SCT from unrelated donors (UD-SCT) has been increasingly performed during the past years. However, UD-SCT-related mortality and morbidity is still considerable, and the question remains as to which patients are at such high risk of recurrence that UD-SCT is indicated and, conversely, which patients do not require transplantation for long-term disease control. A matched-pair analysis was performed among patients treated according to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ALL-REZ BFM) Study Group protocols after first relapse with chemotherapy or UD-SCT. Altogether 81 pairs were identified that could be matched exactly for site of relapse and immunophenotype, and as closely as possible for duration of first remission, age, diagnosis date, and peripheral blast cell count at relapse. No significant difference in the probability of event-free survival (pEFS) between UD-SCT and chemotherapy existed regarding 28 pairs with an intermediate prognosis (0.39 +/- 0.10 vs 0.49 +/- 0.11, P =.105), whereas the pEFS was significantly different in the 53 pairs with a poor prognosis (0.44 +/- 0.07 vs 0.00 +/- 0.00, P <.001). The major reasons of treatment failure among patients who underwent UD-SCT were therapy-related death (TRD; 24/81) and relapses (20/81). In contrast, TRD rarely occurred in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (3/81), but relapse was much more common (62/81). In conclusion, UD-SCT provides better event-free survival for children with high-risk relapsed ALL. However, there is no clear advantage of UD-SCT in patients with intermediate prognosis.","['Borgmann, Anja', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Hartmann, Reinhard', 'Ebell, Wolfram', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Peters, Christina', 'Henze, Gunter']","['Borgmann A', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Hartmann R', 'Ebell W', 'Klingebiel T', 'Peters C', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology and the Medical Center Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. anja.borgmann@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V101.10.3835 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44426-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):3835-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.V101.10.3835.,,,,,['Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Relapse Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have used new anthracycline derivatives, bisdaunorubicin (WP631) and its monomeric analogues (WP700 serie), and look if there was a relation between the drug binding affinity to naked DNA and to cell nucleus in the cell with its cytotoxicity. Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence were used to follow the interaction of anthracycline derivatives with naked DNA and cell nuclei. WP631 interacts with DNA at two distinct stoichiometries, 6:1 and 3:1 base pair (bp)/WP631 molecule (3:1 and 1.5:1 per anthracycline rings). Monomeric daunorubicin (DNR) with its amino sugar N-bound to amino- and nitro-substituted benzyl moiety, representing p-xylenyl linker present in WP631 bisintercalator, is much more binding to DNA than DNR or WP631. These findings are supported by the study of drug binding by nuclei of K562 cells. Around 70% of WP700 intercalate to nucleus DNA in the steady-state, while only 45% of DNR intercalate DNA in the cell. The binding of WP631 by K562 cells is even less effective ( approximately 20%). WP 700 compounds, which are very similar to each other in their binding to DNA, self-association and cell accumulation, differ very distinctly in their cytotoxicity power. The most effective compounds are amino-benzyl derivatives of WP 700 series. The nitro-benzyl compounds have very low toxicity, even if they bind to DNA with similar power with that of the amino derivatives. The comparison of the all data clearly indicates no relation between cytotoxicity of the drug and its ability to intercalate DNA.","['Haj, Hayet Tayeb-Bel', 'Salerno, Milena', 'Priebe, Waldemar', 'Kozlowski, Henryk', 'Garnier-Suillerot, Arlette']","['Haj HT', 'Salerno M', 'Priebe W', 'Kozlowski H', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie Biomoleculaire et Cellulaire (UMR 7033), Universite Paris Nord, 74 rue Marcel Cachin, Bobigny 93017, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (WP 631)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Intercalating Agents/*metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/06/25 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279703000619 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(03)00061-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2003 Jun 15;145(3):349-58. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(03)00061-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, there have been no studies dealing with the effects of these compounds on human natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxic function. NK cells play a central role in immune defense against tumor development and viral infections. Thus, any agent that interferes with the ability of NK cells to lyse their targets could increase the risk of tumor incidence and/or viral infections. In this study, we examined the effects of atrazine, maneb, metiram, zineb, and ziram on the ability of human NK cells to lyse tumor cells. The compounds were tested in both purified NK cells as well as a cell preparation that contained both T and NK lymphocytes (T/NK cells). Lymphocytes were exposed to the compounds for periods of time ranging from 1 h to 6 days. Exposure of highly purified NK cells to 10 microM atrazine, maneb, or metiram inhibited K562 tumor cell lysis by 63+/-25, 95+/-4, and 50+/-6%, respectively, after a 24 h exposure and by 83+/-21, 70+/-39, and 48+/-41% after a 6-day exposure. Exposure to 2.5 microM ziram for 24 h caused a 99+/-2% decrease in lytic function and at 1 microM for 6 days caused a 96+/-4% decrease. However, when T/NK cells were exposed to atrazine, maneb, or metiram for 24 h only 10 microM atrazine and maneb caused a significant decreases in lytic function (61+/-13 and 38+/-18%) and after 6 days only atrazine was inhibitory (54+/-12%). A 24-h exposure to 2.5-microM ziram caused a 41+/-51% decrease in function, but a 6-day exposure to 1 microM ziram caused no inhibition of lytic function.

Prior to the cell attachment, phorbol ester induced translocation of DGKgamma from the cytoplasm to the cell periphery, resulting in its co-localization with F-actin together with protein kinase Cdelta. The results suggest that DGKgamma negatively regulates macrophage differentiation through its catalytic action operating on the cytoskeleton.","['Yamada, Keiko', 'Sakane, Fumio', 'Imai, Shin ichi', 'Tsushima, Shuichi', 'Murakami, Tomohiro', 'Kanoh, Hideo']","['Yamada K', 'Sakane F', 'Imai Si', 'Tsushima S', 'Murakami T', 'Kanoh H']","['Department of Liberal Arts and Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Sapporo Medical University, South-1, West-17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan. oyama@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Macrophages/chemistry/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03007137 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00713-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 May 23;305(1):101-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00713-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the contribution of the t(8;21) to AML, we transduced purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with a retroviral vector that coexpressed AML1-ETO or just the AML1 portion (AML1d) of the translocation along with a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Animals reconstituted with AML1-ETO-expressing cells exhibited many of the hematopoietic developmental abnormalities seen in the bone marrow of human patients with the t(8;21), although the animals did not develop acute leukemia. We noted a gradual increase in primitive myeloblasts that accounted for approximately 10% of bone marrow by 10 months posttransplant. Consistent with this observation was a 50-fold increase in myeloid colony-forming cells in vitro. In addition, accumulation of late stage metamyelocytes was observed in bone marrow along with an increase in immature eosinophil myelocytes that showed abnormal basophilic granulation. There was also a gradual increase in both the frequency and absolute number of AML1-ETO-expressing HSC so that by 10 months posttransplant, there were 29-fold greater HSC numbers than in transplant-matched control mice. These phenotypes were not observed in animals reconstituted with cells expressing only the DNA-binding domain of AML1, suggesting that the ETO domain is necessary to establish the developmental abnormalities associated with AML1-ETO expression in HSC.","['de Guzman, Cristina G', 'Johnson, Amanda', 'Klug, Christopher A']","['de Guzman CG', 'Johnson A', 'Klug CA']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979603000251 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00025-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003 Mar-Apr;30(2):201-6. doi: 10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00025-1.,,,['5T32CA09467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further investigation of a large panel of these tumors revealed that a small number also contain insertions at either Runx3 or Runx1. None of the tumors contained insertions at more than one family member, but in each case proviral insertion was associated with a high level of expression from the upstream (P1) promoter of the respective target gene. Moreover, we confirmed that transcriptional activation of Runx1 does not affect the integrity of the coding sequence, as previously observed for Runx2. These observations suggest that the three Runx genes act as functionally redundant oncogenes in T-cell lymphoma development. To explore the oncogenic potential of Runx2 further we created transgenic mice that over-express this gene in the T cell compartment. These CD2-Runx2 animals show a preneoplastic enlargement of the CD8 immature single positive (ISP) thymocyte pool and develop lymphomas at a low incidence. Although the CD8 ISP population is greatly increased, unlike their wild type counterparts these cells are largely non-cycling. Co-expression of c-MYC in this lineage accentuates the CD8 ISP skew and induces rapid tumor development, confirming the potent synergy that exists between these two oncogenes. Experiments designed to understand the nature of the observed synergy are ongoing and are based on the hypothesis that Runx2 may exert a survival effect in c-MYC expressing tumors in vivo while c-MYC may rescue cells from the antiproliferative effects of Runx2. The oncogenic potential of Runx1 is also being assessed using primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). These studies have revealed that while Runx1 exerts a growth suppressive effect in wild type cells a growth promoting effect is seen in the absence of p53, suggesting that the Runx genes may harbor latent oncogene-like properties.","['Cameron, Ewan R', 'Blyth, Karen', 'Hanlon, Linda', 'Kilbey, Anna', 'Mackay, Nancy', 'Stewart, Monica', 'Terry, Anne', 'Vaillant, Francois', 'Wotton, Sandy', 'Neil, James C']","['Cameron ER', 'Blyth K', 'Hanlon L', 'Kilbey A', 'Mackay N', 'Stewart M', 'Terry A', 'Vaillant F', 'Wotton S', 'Neil JC']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Institute of Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.

We have performed mutational analysis of RUNX2 on 24 unrelated patients with CCD. In 17 patients, 16 distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: 4 frameshift, 3 nonsense, 6 missense, and 2 splicing mutations alongside one polymorphism. The missense mutations were all clustered within the Runt domain and their protein products showed neither DNA binding nor transactivation. On the other hand, some mutant RUNX2 had the Runt domain intact and remained partially competent for transactivation. Coincidentally, one important phenotype of CCD, the short stature, was significantly milder in the patients with the intact Runt domain than those without. Furthermore, a remarkable correlation was found between the short stature and the number of supernumerary teeth. On the other hand, the classic CCD phenotype, hypoplastic clavicles or open fontanelles, was invariably observed regardless of the degree of short stature or supernumerary teeth. Overall, these results suggest that CCD could result from a much smaller loss in the RUNX2 function than envisioned on the basis of the conventional haploinsufficiency model. This makes an interesting contrast to the case of familial and sporadic leukemias mediated by RUNX1 mutations, in which mutants acting in a dominant negative manner have been suggested to confer a higher propensity to develop leukemia.","['Yoshida, Taketoshi', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Yanagida, Masatoshi', 'Miyawaki, Toshio', 'Ito, Yoshiaki', 'Shigesada, Katsuya']","['Yoshida T', 'Kanegane H', 'Osato M', 'Yanagida M', 'Miyawaki T', 'Ito Y', 'Shigesada K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cleidocranial Dysplasia/*genetics', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Growth Disorders/genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Japan', 'Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979603000202 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00020-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003 Mar-Apr;30(2):184-93. doi: 10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00020-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested that the NH(2)-terminal CBM and the Ig-like domain of the LIFR are most important for LIF binding and activity. Using the recently engineered designer cytokine IC7, which induces an active heterodimer of the LIFR and gp130 after binding to the IL-6R, and several receptor chimeras of the LIFR and the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) carrying the CBM of the IL-6R in place of the COOH-terminal LIFR CBM, we could assign individual receptor subdomains to individual binding sites of the ligand. The NH(2)-terminal CBM and the Ig-like domain of the LIFR bind to ligand site III, whereas the COOH-terminal CBM contacts site I. Furthermore, we show that LIFR mutants carrying the IL-6R CBM instead of the COOH-terminal CBM can replace the IL-6R by acting as an alpha-receptor for IL-6.

A rhetorical analysis is conducted using the transcript from a 1995 public meeting during which local residents and a nuclear medicine expert discussed priorities of Fernald site cleanup versus providing radium stored on site for promising cancer research. Two tensions are identified that fostered disagreement among discussants: the first a tension between a local or global context for the controversy and the second a tension between competing definitions of public participation for this issue. This study analyzes the rhetorical strategies by which participants in the Fernald radium debate articulated these tensions and argues that technical and cultural rationality (Plough & Krimsky, 1987) acted as sources of rhetorical invention influencing participants' individual frames of acceptance and the ways they defined and interpreted the situation and crafted persuasive appeals.","['Hamilton, Jennifer Duffield']",['Hamilton JD'],"['University of Cincinnati, Center for Environmental Communication Studies, P.O.

All of 5 HCL samples and an HCL-derived cell line, BNBH-I, showed serrated edges and hairlike projections in May-Grunwald Giemsa stain and protruding actin spikes and lamellipodia in phalloidin stain. These structures were hardly detected on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and precursor B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) cells. Because Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulate the formation of these structures, we examined the expression levels and activation states of Rho GTPases in HCL cells. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were overexpressed and constitutively activated in HCL samples and BNBH-I cells but not in B-CLL or precursor B-ALL cells. Next we overexpressed dominant-negative (DN)-RhoA, DN-Rac1, and DN-Cdc42 in BNBH-I. As a result, each DN mutant repressed the growth of BNBH-I cells by more than 50% and inhibited actin spike formation, but only DN-Racl suppressed lamellipodia formation. We also found that enforced expression of constitutively active-RhoA, Rac, or Cdc42 in the proB-cell line Ba/F3 was sufficient to induce actin spike formation, whereas none of these molecules produced lamellipodia. These results indicated that constitutively activated Rho GTPases regulate the growth and unique morphology of HCL cells.","['Zhang, Xian', 'Machii, Takashi', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Ezoe, Sachiko', 'Kawasaki, Akira', 'Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Ueda, Shuji', 'Sugahara, Hiroyuki', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Mizuki, Masao', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Zhang X', 'Machii T', 'Matsumura I', 'Ezoe S', 'Kawasaki A', 'Tanaka H', 'Ueda S', 'Sugahara H', 'Shibayama H', 'Mizuki M', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Azure Stains)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Actins', 'Azure Stains', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Size', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism/physiology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism/physiology']",,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983784 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Apr;77(3):263-73. doi: 10.1007/BF02983784.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mutation prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16(INK48) to CDK4. To determine the relevance of the mutation, we performed polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis in diverse types of human leukemias and solid tumors. No mobility shifts indicating sequence alterations were observed in 273 tumors and 49 cell lines from diverse kinds of tumors These results suggest that in contrast to melanoma, in many other types of human neoplasms the mutation of the CDK4 gene is very rare. To better understand these findings, we randomly mutagenized the CDK4 gene and used the yeast two-hybrid method to screen for CDK4 mutants that had lost the ability to bind to p16(INK4a). Sequence analysis and in vitro kinase assays showed that most of the mutations that disrupted interactions with p16(INK4) also knocked out the activity of CDK4.

It derives from post-germinal center B-cells and develops as a result of multistep tumorigenic events, because approximately one third of all MM cases have a history of preceding monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma. MM terminates in the formation of extramedullary invasion or in secondary plasma cell leukemia. To account for this clinical experience, investigators have found that intrinsic chromosomal instability followed by complex chromosomal translocations/deletions plays a crucial role in the development from MGUS to MM. Representative aberrations include chromosomal rearrangements involving 14q32 loci and deletion at the long arm of chromosome 13. Contributing to the progression of MM itself are genomic instability and altered methylation of the specific gene promoters. The former results in activation of specific oncogenes such as RAS and FGFR3 or in inactivation of p53, and the latter results in inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, including p16. An accurate understanding of each of these molecular events should help clarify the development of specific molecular targeting therapies based on the differences in dysfunctional signaling pathways found in the cells of all MM patients.","['Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Iida S', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine & Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science, Nagoya, Japan. iida@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",60,2003/05/07 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/05/07 05:00'],"['2003/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983776 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Apr;77(3):207-12. doi: 10.1007/BF02983776.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteasome inhibitors are able to induce apoptosis in chemotherapy-resistant B-CLL cells in vitro. Exposure of B-CLL cells to the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, resulted in inhibition of proteasomal activity within 30 min of treatment and was accompanied by an increase in the level of ubiquitinated proteins. Proteasome inhibitors did not alter the levels of expression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bid, prior to the onset of apoptosis. Instead, proteasome inhibitors induced a caspase-independent conformational change in Bax (as shown by a conformation-specific Bax antibody) and its translocation to mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial perturbation, as evidenced by loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. Similar conformational change and subcellular localization of Bax were observed during apoptosis induced with fludarabine, chlorambucil and prednisolone. These data suggest that alteration of Bax conformation and its redistribution to mitochondria are common and early features of B-CLL apoptosis in response to proteasome inhibitors and other chemotherapeutic agents.","['Dewson, Grant', 'Snowden, Roger T', 'Almond, Jason B', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Dewson G', 'Snowden RT', 'Almond JB', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, PO Box 138, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2003/05/06 05:00,2003/05/29 05:00,['2003/05/06 05:00'],"['2003/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206326 [doi]', '1206326 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 May 1;22(17):2643-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206326.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of bcl-3-deficient mice demonstrated a critical role for bcl-3 in the development of a normal immune response and the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies B cell leukemogenesis and the knockout mouse phenotype remains unclear. Here we have identified and characterized BCL-3-binding protein (B3BP) as a protein interacting specifically with the bcl-3 gene product (BCL-3) by a yeast two-hybrid screen. We found that B3BP associates with not only BCL-3 but also p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases. The N-terminal region of B3BP that contains the ATP-binding site is important for the interaction with BCL-3 and p300/CBP. Homology searches indicate that the ATP-binding region of B3BP, which contains a typical Walker-type ATP-binding P-loop, most resembles that of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase of mammals and polynucleotide kinase of T4 bacteriophage. In fact B3BP shows intrinsic ATP binding and hydrolyzing activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that B3BP is a 5'-polynucleotide kinase. We also found a small MutS-related domain, which is thought to be involved in the DNA repair or recombination reaction, in the C-terminal region of B3BP, and it shows nicking endonuclease activity. These observations might help to gain new insights into the function of BCL-3 and p300/CBP, especially the coupling of transcription with repair or recombination.","['Watanabe, Nobumasa', 'Wachi, Sumiko', 'Fujita, Takashi']","['Watanabe N', 'Wachi S', 'Fujita T']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 3-18-22 Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8613, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (N4BP2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', ""EC 2.7.1.78 (Polynucleotide 5'-Hydroxyl-Kinase)"", 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bacteriophage T4/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', ""Polynucleotide 5'-Hydroxyl-Kinase/metabolism"", 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2003/05/06 05:00,2003/08/15 05:00,['2003/05/06 05:00'],"['2003/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M303518200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)75141-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jul 11;278(28):26102-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M303518200.

Recently the development of new fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques has allowed identification of unexpected deletions of the reciprocal translocation product, the derivative chromosome 9, in 10% to 15% of patients with CML. These deletions are large, span the translocation breakpoint, and occur at the same time as the Ph translocation. Such deletions therefore give rise to previously unsuspected molecular heterogeneity from the very beginning of this disease, and there is mounting evidence for similar deletions associated with other translocations. Several studies have demonstrated that CML patients who carry derivative chromosome 9 deletions exhibit a more rapid progression to blast crisis and a shorter survival. Deletion status is independent of, and more powerful than, the Sokal and Hasford/European prognostic scoring systems. The poor prognosis associated with deletions is seen in patients treated with hydroxyurea or interferon, and preliminary evidence suggests that patients with deletions may also have a worse outcome than nondeleted patients following stem cell transplantation or treatment with imatinib. Poor outcome cannot be attributed to loss of the reciprocal ABL-BCR fusion gene expression alone, and is likely to reflect loss of one or more critical genes within the deleted region. The molecular heterogeneity associated with the Philadelphia translocation provides a new paradigm with potential relevance to all malignancies associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocations and/or fusion gene formation.","['Huntly, Brian J P', 'Bench, Anthony', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Huntly BJ', 'Bench A', 'Green AR']","['Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",111,2003/05/06 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/05/06 05:00'],"['2003/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0123 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44279-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 15;102(4):1160-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0123.

Here we show that treatment of these cells with pertussis toxin and neutralizing antibodies to the chemokine receptor CXCR4 inhibited homing of the cells to the BM, but not the spleen, of NOD/SCID mice. The retention of NK and NK T cells within the spleen and BM was dependent on Galphai signaling and CXCR4 function. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR3 are expressed predominantly on the cell surface of NK T cells. Following activation with interleukin-2 (IL-2), the levels of CXCR4 on NK and NK T cells decreased significantly. Treatment of cells with IL-2 inhibited their migration in response to CXCL12 and their homing and retention in the BM and spleen of NOD/SCID mice. In contrast to CXCR4, the expression levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and the migration of cells in response to CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased after IL-2 treatment. Thus, down-regulation of CXCR4 and up-regulation of CXCR3 may direct the trafficking of cells to the site of inflammation, rather than to hematopoietic organs, and therefore may limit their alloreactive potential.","['Beider, Katia', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Wald, Ori', 'Franitza, Suzanna', 'Dagan-Berger, Michal', 'Wald, Hanna', 'Giladi, Hilla', 'Brocke, Stefan', 'Hanna, Jacob', 'Mandelboim, Ofer', 'Darash-Yahana, Merav', 'Galun, Eithan', 'Peled, Amnon']","['Beider K', 'Nagler A', 'Wald O', 'Franitza S', 'Dagan-Berger M', 'Wald H', 'Giladi H', 'Brocke S', 'Hanna J', 'Mandelboim O', 'Darash-Yahana M', 'Galun E', 'Peled A']","['Hadassah University Hospital, Gene Therapy Institute, PO Box 12000, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Cxcr3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/cytology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,2003/05/06 05:00,2003/10/18 05:00,['2003/05/06 05:00'],"['2003/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3293 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50481-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Sep 15;102(6):1951-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3293.

It encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein containing an alpha-helical coiled-coil domain with four heptad repeats. The heptad repeats consist of four clusters of hydrophobic amino acids that mediate in vivo the complex formation between PML and other PML molecules or PML-RARalpha mutant protein. In this report, we show the production of PML coiled-coil (fragment 223-360) as a fusion protein, its solubilization by the combined action of two different detergents, and its purification with affinity chromatography after column proteolytic cleavage. The FPLC chromatograms of the purified coiled-coils, carried out under non-denaturing conditions, show that the peptide elutes only in the presence of Sarkosyl detergent (conc. 0.1%) and, under these conditions, elutes as a tetrameric complex. This confirms the evidence from in vivo experiments that this region is responsible for protein complex formation. The HPLC analyses show the presence of a single peak eluting under highly hydrophobic conditions, indicating the high hydrophobicity of the peptide in accordance with the primary sequence analysis. Finally, the purified peptide was structurally characterized by means of circular dichroism (CD) measurements that were carried out with low Sarkosyl concentration (0.003%). The CD spectra indicate a low alpha-helical content (13.5%) with respect to predictions based on the primary sequence analysis (PSI-PRED, SS-PRO, and J-PRED), suggesting that the alpha-helix content could be modulated by coiled-coil surrounding domains and/or by other post-translational modifications, even if the effect of the Sarkosyl on the peptide secondary structure cannot be excluded.","['Antolini, Francesco', 'Lo Bello, Mario', 'Sette, Marco']","['Antolini F', 'Lo Bello M', 'Sette M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Applied Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry section, Via del Giochetto s.n.c., 06100 Perugia, Italy. francesco.antolini@brindisi.enea.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/05/06 05:00,2003/09/06 05:00,['2003/05/06 05:00'],"['2003/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1046592803000044 [pii]', '10.1016/s1046-5928(03)00004-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 2003 May;29(1):94-102. doi: 10.1016/s1046-5928(03)00004-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, this supports the contrary view and indicates that average dose, as advocated by the ICRP, is likely to provide a reasonable estimate of carcinogenic risk (within a factor of approximately +/- 3). There are few human data with which to address this issue. The limited data on lung cancer mortality following occupational inhalation of plutonium aerosols, and the incidence of liver cancer and leukaemia due to thorotrast administration for clinical diagnosis, do not appear to support a significant enhancement factor. Very few animal studies, including mainly lung and skin exposures, provide any indication of a hot-particle enhancement for carcinogenicity. Some recent in vitro malignant transformation experiments provide evidence foran enhanced cell transformation for hot-particle exposures but, properly interpreted, the effect is modest.

The protein has anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and is elevated in patients with myelo-monocytic leukaemia and infection. For rational use and evaluation of this potential new quantity it is important to have knowledge of its biological variability and to use a methodology that has a sufficiently analytical quality. The day-to-day and diurnal biological variabilities of sCD163 were studied in 12 healthy people using a sandwich ELISA. The within-run-, between run- and total analytical coefficients of variation were estimated to 3.6%, 4.8% and 6.0%, respectively. The day-to-day within-subject biological variation was estimated to 9.0%, and the between-subject biological variation to 35.9%. A diurnal variation in sCD163 concentrations with 14% lower values in the night (supine position) was observed. The ratio between total analytical variation and within-subject biological variation was 0.67. The index of individuality, calculated as the ratio between within-subject biological variation and between-subject biological variation, was low and similar to complement factors and immunoglobulins. A low index of individuality is important in a monitoring situation where small changes from the set point of the individual can be detected in serial measurements.

They were 19 women and 13 men, aged 18-63 (median 44) years. Their AML were classified according to the FAB classification: 3 M0, 3 M1, 9 M2, 14 M4, 3 M5. Induction chemotherapy consisted of 1-2 cycles with 3-4 doses of daunorubicin (DNR) 45 mg/m2/d i.v. and 14 doses of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 200 mg/m2 per 3-h infusion every 12 hours. After the treatment patients, not being in complete remission, got the HD cycle with 10 high-doses of Ara-C 2000 mg/m2 per 3-h infusion every 12 hours i.v. and DNR 45 mg/m2/d i.v. on days 4 and 5, then the EMi cycle composed of etoposide 100 mg/m2/d i.v. for 5 days and mitozantrone 10-12 mg/m2/d i.v. on days 1, 3 and 5. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 25 of 32 (78%) patients after 1-3 cycles. Five patients died between days 5 and 24 of treatment of infections, two patients were resistant to 4 cycles of induction therapy and survived 8.4 and 13.5 months. Three patients chose allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in their 1st CR from their relatives. Two of them have been living in CR for 115 a 110 months since diagnosis, the third died of sepsis on the day 52 after transplantation. Two patients in CR died of infections after their 2nd. consolidation cycle. Twenty patients in CR completed 2-4 consolidation cycles (1-3 HD, 1 EMi). Median of their CR duration was 17.8 (2-117) months. Relapse appeared in 12 cases after 4.4-34.8 (median 12.5) months, 8 patients (6 women and 2 men, aged 29-63 years) have remained longer than 5 years in their 1st. CR.

After 62 months in CR a pancytopenia with dysplastic bone marrow changes developed in one of them, probably a secondary myelodysplastic syndrome, lasting for further 33 months. Event-free survival at 5 years was 27.5% (8/29 patients), significantly better (p = 0.046) against 7.5% (3/40) patients treated without HD cycles in the years 1982-1987.

The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (120-180 mg/m(2)), busulfan (8 mg/kg p.o. or 6.4 mg/kg i.v.), and antithymocyte globulin ( n=25). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine ( n=36) and a short course of methotrexate ( n=29) or mycophenolate mofetil ( n=3). The median age of the patients was 55 years (range: 23-72). The reasons to perform a dose-reduced conditioning were reduced performance status ( n=14), age ( n=12), prior autologous ( n=5) or allogeneic ( n=1) transplantation, or prior/active fungal infection ( n=5). Diagnoses at transplantation were refractory anemia (RA) ( n=8), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) ( n=6), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) ( n=13), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) ( n=3), and sAML ( n=7). Stem cell sources were peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) ( n=29) or bone marrow ( n=8). One patient received a T-cell-depleted peripheral stem cell graft. Two primary graft failures were observed (6%). Engraftment of leukocytes (>1.0x10(9)/l) and platelets (>20x10(9)/l) was seen after a median of 14 days. Acute GVHD grade II-IV was seen in 37%, while severe grade III/IV GVHD was observed in six patients (17%). Chronic GVHD was seen in 13 patients (48%). There were ten deaths (27%) due to treatment (TRM). The probability of TRM was higher in patients with unrelated donors (45 vs 12%, p=0.03) and in patients with poor cytogenetics in comparison to those with a low or intermediate karyotype (75 vs 20%, p=0.009). During follow-up 12 patients relapsed (32%). Patients without chronic GVHD had a significantly higher probability of relapse compared to those with chronic GVHD (70 vs 15%, p=0.02). After a median follow-up of 20 months, the 3-year estimated disease-free survival (DFS) is 38% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21-55%] and the overall survival (OS) is 39% (95% CI: 22-56%). The OS and DFS after related and unrelated transplantations was 45% (95% CI: 19-71%) vs 31% (95% CI: 9-53%) (n.s.) and 51% (95% CI: 29-73%) vs 25% (95% CI: 4-47%) (n.s.), respectively.

It is still obscure how Bcr-Abl provides the leukemic cell a strong resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. A rational drug development produced a specific inhibitor of the catalytic activity of Bcr-Abl called STI571. This drug was shown to eliminate Bcr-Abl-positive cells both in vitro and in vivo, although resistant cells may appear in culture and relapse occurs in some patients. In the study described here, Bcr-Abl-positive cells treated with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as herbimycin A, genistein or STI571 lost their phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, but were still extremely resistant to apoptosis. Therefore, in the absence of tyrosine-kinase activity, Bcr-Abl-positive cells continue to signal biochemically to prevent apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. We propose that secondary antiapoptotic signals are entirely responsible for the resistance of Bcr-Abl-positive cells.

Consequently, MMP inhibitors have been developed as a new class of anticancer drugs, many of which are in clinical trials. The exact mechanism of the antineoplastic activity of MMP antagonists is unknown. To investigate the mechanism, we hypothesized that MMP inhibitors enhance the actions of apoptosis-inducing agents. To test this hypothesis, we treated breast, melanoma, leukemia, osteosarcoma, and normal breast epithelial cells with (2R)-2-[(4-biphenylsulfonyl)amino]-3-phenylproprionic acid (compound 5a), an organic inhibitor of MMP-2/MMP-9, alone or in combination with TNFalpha or other apoptotic agents. FACS analysis showed that 5a interacted synergistically with ligands of the TNF receptor superfamily, including TNFalpha and TNF receptor-like apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and with a Fas-cross-linking antibody (CH11), UV, paclitaxel, thapsigargin, and staurosporin, to induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific manner. Other MMP inhibitors did not synergize with TNFalpha. Compound 5a did not act directly on the mitochondrion or via changes in protein synthesis. Instead, the mechanism requires ligand-receptor interaction and caspase 8 activation. Investigation of the effect of 5a on tumor growth in vivo revealed that continuous treatment of subcutaneous melanoma with a combination of 5a plus TRAIL reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in nude mice. Our data demonstrate that 5a possesses a novel proapoptotic function, thus providing an alternative mechanism for its antineoplastic action. These observations have important implications for combination cancer therapy.","['Nyormoi, O', 'Mills, L', 'Bar-Eli, M']","['Nyormoi O', 'Mills L', 'Bar-Eli M']","['Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (2-((4-biphenylsulfonyl)amino)-3-phenylpropionic acid)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Ligands', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', '*Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2003/05/03 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401209 [doi]', '4401209 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2003 May;10(5):558-69. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401209.,,,"['CA76098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the development of therapies targeted against specific molecular pathways involved in cancer progression has resulted in dramatic responses in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other cancers. A number of compounds are currently being evaluated in clinical trials that alter pathways involved thyroid cancer, and several of these agents have been tested in thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo.

Here we exploit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to demonstrate that cyclin T1 physically interacts in vivo with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein within specific subnuclear compartments that are coincident with PML nuclear bodies. Deletion mutants at the C-terminal region of cyclin T1 are negative for FRET with PML and fail to localize to nuclear bodies. Cyclin T1 and PML are also found associated outside of nuclear bodies, and both proteins are present at the chromatinized HIV-1 LTR promoter upon Tat transactivation. Taken together these results suggest that PML proteins regulate Tat- mediated transcriptional activation by modulating the availability of cyclin T1 and other essential cofactors to the transcription machinery.","['Marcello, Alessandro', 'Ferrari, Aldo', 'Pellegrini, Vittorio', 'Pegoraro, Gianluca', 'Lusic, Marina', 'Beltram, Fabio', 'Giacca, Mauro']","['Marcello A', 'Ferrari A', 'Pellegrini V', 'Pegoraro G', 'Lusic M', 'Beltram F', 'Giacca M']","['Molecular Medicine Laboratory, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), Area Science Park, Padriciano 99, 34012 Trieste, Italy. marcello@icgeb.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (CCNT1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin T)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin T', 'Cyclins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Energy Transfer', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/05/03 05:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdg205 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2003 May 1;22(9):2156-66. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdg205.,,,,,,,,,PMC156077,,,,,,,

CTLs have often been indicated as important in TS/A tumor destruction, but their generation in this model has been rarely studied, nor have their precise target(s) been identified. We hypothesized that the gp70 Env product of an endogenous murine leukemia virus could be a target antigen for TS/A-specific CTLs and investigated this possibility in four different TS/A cell lines engineered with the genes that encode IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, interleukin-4, and B7.1, respectively. All tumor cell lines expressed gp70, albeit at different levels, as demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Transfected tumor cells exhibited a delayed growth in vivo, and partial tumor regression. Spleen cells from mice that displayed tumor regression had high percentages of CD8(+) T cells that were specifically stained with L(d) tetramers loaded with gp70(423-431), the antigenic epitope of gp70 protein. Mixed leukocyte-peptide and mixed leukocyte-tumor cultures, set up by stimulating splenocytes with the immunogenic peptide and with transfected TS/A tumor cells, respectively, resulted in similar large increases in tetramer-reactive CD8(+) T cells and showed high lytic activity specific for gp70(423-431). Finally, in a Cold Target Inhibition assay, lytic activity of a mixed leukocyte-tumor culture was inhibited in an overlapping fashion by both the TS/A line used for restimulation and 293L(d) cells loaded with gp70(423-431) peptide, but not by 293L(d) cells pulsed with an irrelevant H-2 L(d) epitope, thus demonstrating that all or most of the cytotoxic activity was directed exclusively against this antigenic epitope.","['Rosato, Antonio', 'Dalla Santa, Silvia', 'Zoso, Alessia', 'Giacomelli, Sofia', 'Milan, Gabriella', 'Macino, Beatrice', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Dellabona, Paolo', 'Lollini, Pier-Luigi', 'De Giovanni, Carla', 'Zanovello, Paola']","['Rosato A', 'Dalla Santa S', 'Zoso A', 'Giacomelli S', 'Milan G', 'Macino B', 'Tosello V', 'Dellabona P', 'Lollini PL', 'De Giovanni C', 'Zanovello P']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy. antonio.rosato@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology']",,2003/05/03 05:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 May 1;63(9):2158-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cotreatment of K562 cells with 250 nM imatinib mesylate and 2.0 micro M suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for 24 h, exposures that were minimally toxic alone, resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor release), caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar events were observed in other Bcr/Abl(+) cells (i.e., LAMA 84), and in cells exposed to STI571 in combination with the HDI sodium butyrate. Coexposure of cells to HDIs in conjunction with STI571 resulted in multiple perturbations in signaling and cell cycle-regulatory proteins, including down-regulation of Raf, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospho-Akt, phospho-signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, cyclin D1, and Mcl-1, accompanied by dephosphorylation and cleavage of retinoblastoma protein and a striking increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. Coexposure of Bcr/Abl(+) cells to STI571 also blocked SAHA-mediated induction of p21(CIP1) and resulted in down-regulation of Bcr/Abl protein expression. STI571 and SAHA also interacted synergistically to induce apoptosis in STI571-resistant K562 and LAMA 84 cells that display increased Bcr/Abl protein expression. Lastly, inducible expression of a constitutively active MEK1/2 construct significantly attenuated SAHA/STI571-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells, implicating disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis in synergistic antileukemic effects of this drug combination. Together, these findings indicate that combined exposure of Bcr/Abl(+) cells to the kinase inhibitor STI571 and HDIs leads to diverse perturbations in signaling and cell cycle-regulatory proteins, associated with a marked increase in mitochondrial damage and cell death. They also raise the possibility that this strategy may be effective in some Bcr/Abl(+) cells that are resistant to STI571 through increased Bcr/Abl expression.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Almenara, Jorge', 'Subler, Mark', 'Krystal, Geoffrey', 'Conrad, Daniel', 'Varticovski, Lubya', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Rahmani M', 'Almenara J', 'Subler M', 'Krystal G', 'Conrad D', 'Varticovski L', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Vorinostat']",,2003/05/03 05:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 May 1;63(9):2118-26.,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory data suggest that As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis or cell differentiation of hematopoietic or solid tumor cells. To date, there has been no study on the effects of As(2)O(3) on glioma cells. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effect of As(2)O(3) on cell growth inhibition and cell death mechanisms in human glioma cells. As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited the proliferation of all six of the glioma cell lines (U373, U87, U251, GB1, A-172, and T98G) tested in this study in a dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) of As(2)O(3) for all of the tumor cell lines was <2 micro M. Previous studies have shown that this is a clinically safe concentration. Treatment with 2 micro M As(2)O(3) induced G(2)/M arrest in all of the glioma cell lines. Autophagy (programmed cell death type II), but not apoptosis (programmed cell death type I), was detected by electron microscopy in U-373-MG cells treated with 2 micro M As(2)O(3). Caspase inhibitors did not halt As(2)O(3)-induced cell death. Furthermore, combination of As(2)O(3) with bafilomycin A1 autophagy inhibitor enhanced the antitumor effect of As(2)O(3) through induction of apoptosis.

Rarely, CLL cells accumulate in a single atypical site. The mechanism underlying this unusual distribution of CLL cells has not been studied previously. We obtained peripheral blood from five patients having early stage CLL with heavy prostate infiltration. These patients' circulating CLL cells bound strongly in vitro to cultured prostate cell lines PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 and to short-term cultures of fresh prostate cells but not to colon, breast, or bladder cells. CLL cells from patients without prostate infiltration did not bind in vitro to any cell line. Peripheral blood CLL cells from one patient with CLL with heavy prostate infiltration were fused with a mouse-human heteromyeloma line to make hybridomas expressing the same monoclonal IgM as the patient's CLL cells. The hybridoma cells bound specifically to prostate cells. IgM secreted by the hybridoma blocked binding of the patient's CLL cells to prostate cells. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the secreted IgM bound specifically to prostate cells.

IFN receptors are expressed widely in mammalian cells and virtually all different cell types express them on their surface. The Type I IFN receptor has a multichain structure, composed of at least two distinct receptor subunits, IFNalphaR1 and IFNalphaR2. Two Jak-kinases, Tyk-2 and Jak-1, associate with the different receptor subunits and are activated in response to IFNalpha or IFNbeta to regulate engagement of multiple downstream signaling cascades. These include the Stat-pathway, whose function is essential for transcriptional activation of IFN-sensitive genes, and the insulin receptor substrate pathway, which regulates downstream activation of the phosphatidyl-inositol-3' kinase. Members of the Map family of kinases are also activated by the Type I IFN receptor and participate in the generation of IFN signals. The p38 Map kinase pathway appears to play a very important role in the induction of IFN responses. p38 is rapidly activated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor, and such an activation is regulated by the small G-protein Rac1, which functions as its upstream effector in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. The activated form of p38 regulates downstream activation of other serine kinases, notably MapKapK-2 and MapKapK-3, indicating the existence of Type I IFN-dependent signaling cascades activated downstream of p38. Extensive studies have shown that p38 plays a critical role in Type I IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation, without modifying activation of the Stat-pathway. It is now well established that the function of p38 is essential for gene transcription via ISRE or GAS elements, but has no effects on the phosphorylation of Stat-proteins, the formation of Stat-complexes, and their binding to the promoters of IFN-sensitive genes. As Type I IFNs regulate gene expression for proteins with antiviral properties, it is not surprising that pharmacological inhibition of the p38 pathway blocks induction of IFNalpha-antiviral responses. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of p38 abrogates the suppressive effects of Type I IFNs on normal human hematopoietic progenitors, indicating a critical role for this signaling cascade in the induction of the regulatory effects of Type I IFNs on hematopoiesis. p38 is also activated during IFNalpha-treatment of primary leukemia cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Such activation is required for IFNalpha-dependent suppression of leukemic cell progenitor growth, indicating that this pathway plays a critical role in the induction of the antileukemic effects of IFNalpha.","['Platanias, Leonidas C']",['Platanias LC'],"['Robert H.

No mutagenic activity was found on the Salmonella typhimurium strains T98 and T100, either with or without S9 activation. On the other hand, the sap showed an inhibitory effect against the mutagenic activity of the indirectly acting mutagen 2-Aminoanthracene in presence of S9 and a moderate protective activity against directly acting mutagens Sodium Azide and 2-Nitrofluorene.

In leukemias, however, early hematopoietic progenitors self-renew themselves, fail to respond to differentiation signals, and do not undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). The basic mechanisms of differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells have been the long-term objective of our work. By exploiting widely studied murine and human leukemic cell systems as models of hematopoietic cell differentiation, we explored the mechanisms by which pharmaceutical agents initiate differentiation in leukemic systems. In this article, we present the developmental program of MEL cells with emphasis given on the role of commitment to terminal maturation. Commitment is initiated via inducer-receptor-mediated processes and leads to discrete patterns of expression of several genes that contribute to growth arrest at the G1 phase, expression of differentiated phenotype, and differentiation-dependent apoptosis (DDA). Overall, MEL erythroid cell differentiation represents a developmental program with a highly coordinated set of processes that is ""triggered"" by an inducer and functions via a network of genes and proteins interacting with each other harmonically to give birth to lineage-restricted phenotype.","['Tsiftsoglou, Asterios S', 'Pappas, Ioannis S', 'Vizirianakis, Ioannis S']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Pappas IS', 'Vizirianakis IS']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-541 24 Thessaloniki, Greece. tsif@pharm.auth.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Clone Cells/cytology/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice']",96,2003/05/03 05:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504003108748546 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2003;13(6-10):339-46. doi: 10.3727/096504003108748546.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, to investigate the different immune response in sheep that carried alleles associated with resistance and susceptible for 30 weeks after infection with BLV, we selected sheep that had the RK/RK or SR/SR genotype among the 52 sheep analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing of PCR product for the OLA-DRB1 exon 2 and infected them with BLV. Although the number of BLV-infected cells and virus titer had been maintaining low levels throughout the experimental period, the sheep with the RK/RK genotype could induce expansion of CD5- B-cells and rapid production of neutralizing antibody in the early phase of infection. The level of incorporation of [3H]thymidine by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the sheep with RK/RK genotype gave a strong response to BLV virion antigen and synthetic antigenic peptides that corresponded to T-helper epitope of the BLV envelope glycoprotein gp51. In contrast, the sheep with SR/SR genotype showed a strong response to BLV virion antigen and synthetic antigenic peptides that corresponded to T-cytotoxic and B-cell epitopes. In such cases, the animals with the RK/RK strongly expressed IFN-gamma, the animals with SR/SR genotype strongly expressed IL-2.

So as far as reduced PMNs, monocytes, phagocytes and lymphocytes of alcoholics are concerned, ethanol-induced apoptosis may well be an important reason.","['Guan, Z', 'Li, Y', 'Wang, S', 'Yang, Y']","['Guan Z', 'Li Y', 'Wang S', 'Yang Y']","['Medical Analysis Center, Beijing Medical University, Beijing 100083, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Wei Sheng Yan Jiu,Wei sheng yan jiu = Journal of hygiene research,9426367,['3K9958V90M (Ethanol)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ethanol/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology', 'Humans']",,2003/05/03 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/05/03 05:00'],"['2003/05/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Wei Sheng Yan Jiu. 2000 Jan 30;29(1):15-6, back cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOURCES: Literature review using Medline. SUMMARY: The diagnosis of childhood cancer is complex and many variables play an important role. Early detection and prompt therapy have the potential to reduce mortality and treatment morbidity. A better understanding of the relationship between symptoms and diagnosis is important for the development of effective public health strategies. CONCLUSIONS: There are several factors that may be associated with length of time between symptoms and diagnosis. Lag time to diagnosis depends on tumor type and age. To determine warning signs and symptoms that should alert to the possibility of malignant disease is still a challenge.","['Rodrigues, Karla Emilia', 'de Camargo, Beatriz']","['Rodrigues KE', 'de Camargo B']","['Hospital do Cancer de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Brazil,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),9308586,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Retinal Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Retinoblastoma/diagnosis', 'Time Factors', 'Wilms Tumor/diagnosis']",33,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/07/24 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0104-42302003000100030 [pii]', '10.1590/s0104-42302003000100030 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992). 2003 Jan-Mar;49(1):29-34. doi: 10.1590/s0104-42302003000100030.

(CAS No. 5634-39-9) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).,1-171,"Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of iodinated glycerol (Organidin(R)., a complex mixture prepared by the reaction of iodine with glycerol and found to contain 33% 3-iodo-1,2-propanediol as the major component) were conducted because of human exposure to iodinated glycerol as an expectorant and its possible relationship to the formation of alkyl iodides, e.g., methyl iodide, a suspected animal carcinogen. These studies were conducted by giving iodinated glycerol in water by gavage (5 days per week) to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted with iodinated glycerol in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and B6C3F1 mice (in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test). Also, 3-iodo-1,2-propanediol was tested in S. typhimurium and B6C3F1 mice (in vivo micronucleus assay). Sixteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: Sixteen-day studies were conducted by giving iodinated glycerol at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg to rats and up to 500 mg/kg to mice. All female rats and 4/5 male mice in the highest dose group died before the end of the studies; there were no dose-related effects on body weights of male or female rats or male mice at the end of the studies. The forestomach of 2/5 female mice that received 500 mg/kg was thickened and granular. Thirteen-week studies were conducted by administering iodinated glycerol at doses up to 500 mg/kg to rats and mice. During these studies, 3/10 female rats and 1/10 female mice that received 500 mg/kg died. Final mean body weights of rats and mice that received 500 mg/kg were 4% lower than those of vehicle controls for males and 6%-7% lower for females. Kidney tubular cell lesions, including cortical necrosis, regeneration, and calcification, were observed at increased incidences in the highest dose group of female rats. Lymphoid hyperplasia of the stomach was observed in dosed male and female rats. Kidney tubular cell regeneration was also observed in dosed female mice. Inflammation or abscesses of mild-to-moderate severity and hyperplasia, acanthosis, and/or hyperkeratosis of mild-to-moderate severity were observed in the forestomach of the highest dosed group of female mice. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Two-year studies were conducted by administering 0, 125, or 250 mg/kg iodinated glycerol in deionized water by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 male F344/N rats and 50 male B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 female F344/N rats and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were administered iodinated glycerol on the same schedule at lower doses of 0, 62, or 125 mg/kg because of the increased severity of kidney and stomach lesions in the 13-week studies. Mean body weights of high dose male rats were 5%-10% lower than those of vehicle controls from week 43 to week 68 and 10%-13% lower from week 72 to the end of the studies. Mean body weights of low dose male rats and high dose female rats were 4%-9% lower than those of vehicle controls from week 88 to the end of the studies. The survival of the high dose group of male rats was considerably lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 86. No other significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats of either sex (male: vehicle control, 28/50; low dose, 20/50, high dose, 2/50; female: 31/50; 30/50; 27/50). Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control male mice were similar. Mean body weights of high dose female mice were 6%-8% lower than those of vehicle controls from week 40 to week 64 and were 9%-13% lower thereafter. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of mice of either sex (male: 36/50; 40/50; 32/50; female: 40/50; 33/50; 38/50). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia were increased in dosed male rats (vehicle control, 14/50; low dose, 29/50; high dose, 24/50). Follicular cell carcinomas of the thyroid gland in male rats occurred at an increased incidence in low dose male rats (0/49; s of the thyroid gland in male rats occurred at an increased incidence in low dose male rats (0/49; 5/49; 1/49). Reduced survival of high dose male rats may have been responsible for the decreased tumor incidence in this group relative to that in the low dose group. Follicular cell carcinomas were observed in one low dose and one high dose female rat. Follicular cell carcinomas of the thyroid gland have been observed in 3/293 water gavage vehicle control male F344/N rats and in 10/1,904 untreated control male F344/N rats. Adenomas of the nasal cavity were observed in two high dose male rats. Adenomas of the nasal cavity have not been observed in 300 water gavage vehicle control male F344/N rats or in 1,936 untreated control male F344/N rats. Squamous metaplasia and focal atrophy of the salivary glands were observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (squamous metaplasia--male: 0/48; 47/50; 48/49; female:1/49; 48/50; 49/50; focal atrophy--male: 1/48; 10/50; 30/49; female: 0/49; 4/50; 11/50). In dosed female mice, adenomas of the anterior pituitary gland were increased (10/47; 15/45; 24/46). The incidences of adenomas of the harderian gland in dosed female mice were increased (6/50; 8/40; 13/50). A carcinoma of the harderian gland was observed in another high dose female mouse. Dilatation of the thyroid gland follicle and follicular cell hyperplasia were observed at increased incidences in dosed mice (dilatation--male: 0/48; 28/50; 32/50; female: 4/48; 11/48; 10/48; hyperplasia--male: 3/48; 46/50; 34/50; female: 2/48; 25/48; 35/48). The incidences of follicular cell adenomas were 3/48, 6/50, and 0/50 for males and 2/48, 3/48, and 4/48 for females. Hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the forestomach were observed at increased incidences in high dose male mice (hyperkeratosis: 0/49; 0/49; 5/50; acanthosis: 0/49; 1/49; 5/50). Squamous cell papillomas were observed in female mice (1/49; 2/50; 5/49). The historical incidence of forestomach squamous cell neoplasms is 4/339 (1.2&percnt;) in water gavage vehicle control female B6C3F1 mice and is 18/1,994 (0.9&percnt;) in untreated control female B6C3F1 mice. Squamous cell neoplasms were not observed in male mice. Genetic Toxicology: Treatment of the base-substitution mutant S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535 with iodinated glycerol in a preincubational protocol with and without S9 resulted in a dose-related increase in the number of revertant colonies; no increase in revertants was observed with the frame-shift mutant strains TA98 or TA1537. 3-Iodo-1,2-propanediol was also mutagenic in TA100 with or without S9; it was not mutagenic in TA98. Iodinated glycerol increased the number of trifluorothymidine-resistant cells in mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK&plusmn; assay in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation; it was not tested with activation. Iodinated glycerol induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells without S9; with S9, the frequency of SCEs was increased more than without S9 but no chromosomal aberrations were induced. No increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in the bone marrow of B6C3F1 mice after injection with either iodinated glycerol or 3-iodo-1,2-propanediol. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity for male F344/N rats administered iodinated glycerol, as indicated by increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and follicular cell carcinomas of the thyroid gland. Adenomas of the nasal cavity in two high dose male rats may have been related to the administration of iodinated glycerol. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats administered 62 or 125 mg/kg iodinated glycerol by gavage for 103 weeks. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice administered 125 or 250 mg/kg iodinated glycerol by gavage for 103 weeks. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice administered iodinated glycerol, as indicated by increased incidences of adenomas of the anterior pituitary gland and neoplasms of the harderian gland. Squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach may have been related to the administration of iodinated glycerol. Significant nonneoplastic lesions considered related to exposure of iodinated glycerol were squamous metaplasia and focal atrophy of the salivary gland in male and female rats. Dilatation of the thyroid gland follicle and follicular cell hyperplasia were observed in male and female mice.

Previous feed studies were done by the National Cancer Institute using Osborne-Mendel rats and B6C3F1 mice. Thirteen-Week Studies: Thirteen-week studies with groups of 10 rats of each sex were conducted at doses of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 mg/kg dichlorvos in corn oil. All rats that received 32 or 64 mg/kg dichlorvos and 4/10 females that received 16 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control rats were similar. Thirteen-week studies with groups of 10 mice of each sex were conducted at doses of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg. All 10 male mice and 9/10 female mice that received 160 mg/kg and 5/10 male mice that received 80 mg/kg dichlorvos died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control mice were similar. No compound-related gross or microscopic pathologic effects were observed in rats or mice. Two-year studies of dichlorvos were conducted by administering 0, 4, or 8 mg/kg dichlorvos, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex. Groups of 50 male B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 10, or 20 mg/kg dichlorvos on the same schedule, and groups of 50 B6C3F1 female mice were administered 0, 20, or 40 mg/kg dichlorvos. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control rats and mice were similar. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats or mice of either sex (rats--male: vehicle control, 31/50; low dose, 25/50; high dose, 24/50; female: 31/50; 26/50; 26/50; mice-- male: 35/50; 27/50; 29/50; female: 26/50; 29/50; 34/50). Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Adenomas of the exocrine pancreas occurred at greater incidences in dosed rats than in vehicle controls (male: vehicle control, 25/50; low dose, 30/49; high dose, 33/50; female: 2/50; 3/47; 6/50). Mononuclear cell leukemia in both dosed groups of male rats occurred more frequently than in vehicle controls (11/50; 20/50; 21/50). Mammary gland fibroadenomas and fibroadenomas or adenomas (combined) in dosed female rats occurred at increased incidences relative to the vehicle controls (9/50; 19/50; 17/50). Multiple fibroadenomas occurred in dosed female rats but not in vehicle controls (0/50; 6/50; 3/50); carcinomas occurred in two vehicle control and two low dose female rats. In mice, incidences of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were increased in the high dose groups compared with those in the vehicle controls (male: 1/50; 1/50; 5/50; female: 5/49; 6/49; 18/50). Two high dose female mice developed forestomach squamous cell carcinomas. Genetic Toxicology: Dichlorvos was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 with and without metabolic activation but was not mutagenic in strain TA98. Dichlorvos was mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay without metabolic activation. Dichlorvos induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of dichlorvos for male F344/N rats, as shown by increased incidences of adenomas of the exocrine pancreas and mononuclear cell leukemia. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of dichlorvos for female F344/N rats, as shown by increased incidences of adenomas of the exocrine pancreas and mammary gland fibroadenomas. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of dichlorvos for male B6C3F1 mice, as shown by increased incidences of forestomach squamous cell papillomas. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of dichlorvos for female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by increased incidences of forestomach squamous cell papils cell papillomas.

We investigated whether the expression of ZAP-70 by CLL cells correlated with the IgVH mutational status, disease progression, and survival. METHODS: The expression of ZAP-70 was analyzed in T-cell and B-cell lines and in peripheral-blood samples from 56 patients with CLL with the use of flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The results were correlated with the IgVH mutational status and clinical outcome. RESULTS: ZAP-70 was detected by flow-cytometric analysis in cells of T-cell lineage and in leukemic cells from 32 of 56 patients with CLL. In all patients in whom at least 20 percent of the leukemic cells were positive for ZAP-70, IgVH was unmutated, whereas IgVH mutations were found in 21 of 24 patients in whom less than 20 percent of the leukemic cells were positive for ZAP-70 (P<0.001). Concordant results were obtained when ZAP-70 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. The level of ZAP-70 expression did not change over time (median, 37 months) in sequential samples from 30 patients with CLL. Patients with Binet stage A CLL who had at least 20 percent ZAP-70-positive leukemic cells had more rapid progression and poorer survival than those with less than 20 percent ZAP-70-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CLL, expression of ZAP-70, as detected by flow-cytometric analysis, correlated with IgVH mutational status, disease progression, and survival.","['Crespo, Marta', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Marce, Silvia', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Campo, Elies', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Crespo M', 'Bosch F', 'Villamor N', 'Bellosillo B', 'Colomer D', 'Rozman M', 'Marce S', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Campo E', 'Montserrat E']","[""Department of Hematology, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa023143 [doi]', '348/18/1764 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2003 May 1;348(18):1764-75. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa023143.,['Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,,,,,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2003 May 1;348(18):1797-9.

First, PBX is actively exported from the nucleus via a CRM1-dependent pathway. Second, nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within the PBX HD are masked by intramolecular contacts. In a screen to identify additional proteins directing PBX subcellular localization, we identified a fragment of murine nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain B (NMHCB). The interaction of NMHCB with PBX was verified by coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence staining revealed colocalization of NMHCB with cytoplasmic PBX in the mouse embryo distal limb bud. The interaction domain in PBX mapped to a conserved PBC-B region harboring a potential coiled-coil structure. In support of the cytoplasmic retention function, the NMHCB fragment competes with MEIS1A to redirect PBX, and the fly PBX homologue EXD, to the cytoplasm of mammalian and insect cells. Interestingly, MEIS1A also localizes to the cytoplasm in the presence of the NMHCB fragment. These activities are largely independent of nuclear export. We show further that the subcellular localization of EXD is deregulated in Drosophila zipper mutants that are depleted of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain. This study reveals a novel and evolutionarily conserved mechanism controlling the subcellular distribution of PBX and EXD proteins.","['Huang, He', 'Paliouras, Miltiadis', 'Rambaldi, Isabel', 'Lasko, Paul', 'Featherstone, Mark']","['Huang H', 'Paliouras M', 'Rambaldi I', 'Lasko P', 'Featherstone M']","['McGill Cancer Centre, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1Y6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Extremities/embryology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myosins/*metabolism', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.10.3636-3645.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 May;23(10):3636-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.10.3636-3645.2003.,,,,,,,,,PMC164772,,,,,,,

We undertook a two-hybrid screen of a K562 cDNA library to identify transcription factors that interacted with Fli-1 and were potential regulators of megakaryocyte development. Here we report the physical interaction of Fli-1 with GATA-1, a well-characterized, zinc finger transcription factor critical for both erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We map the minimal domains required for the interaction and show that the zinc fingers of GATA-1 interact with the Ets domain of Fli-1. GATA-1 has previously been shown to interact with the Ets domain of the Fli-1-related protein PU.1, and the two proteins appear to inhibit each other's activity. In contrast, we demonstrate that GATA-1 and Fli-1 synergistically activate the megakaryocyte-specific promoters GPIX and GPIbalpha in transient transfections. Quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides derived from the GPIX promoter containing Ets and GATA binding motifs reveal that Fli-1 and GATA-1 exhibit cooperative DNA binding in which the binding of GATA-1 to DNA is increased approximately 26-fold in the presence of Fli-1 (from 4.2 to 0.16 nM), providing a mechanism for the observed transcriptional synergy. To test the effect on endogenous genes, we stably overexpressed Fli-1 in K562 cells, a line rich in GATA-1. Overexpression of Fli-1 induced the expression of the endogenous GPIX and GPIbalpha genes as measured by Northern blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. This work suggests that Fli-1 and GATA-1 work together to activate the expression of genes associated with the terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes.","['Eisbacher, Michael', 'Holmes, Melissa L', 'Newton, Anthea', 'Hogg, Philip J', 'Khachigian, Levon M', 'Crossley, Merlin', 'Chong, Beng H']","['Eisbacher M', 'Holmes ML', 'Newton A', 'Hogg PJ', 'Khachigian LM', 'Crossley M', 'Chong BH']","['Centre for Thrombosis and Vascular Research, School of Medical Sciences and Department of Medicine, St. George Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales 2052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.10.3427-3441.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 May;23(10):3427-41. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.10.3427-3441.2003.,,,,,,,['Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jun;24(11):5088'],,PMC154245,,,,,,,

Although Tax has been previously shown to interact with the KIX domain of CBP/p300 in vitro, the precise functional relevance of this interaction remains unclear. Using two distinct approaches to interrupt the physical interaction between Tax and KIX, we find that Tax transactivation from chromatin templates is strongly dependent on CBP/p300 recruitment via the KIX domain. Additionally, we find that the primary functional contribution of CBP/p300 to Tax transactivation resides in the intrinsic acetyltransferase activity of the coactivators. These studies unexpectedly uncover a specific requirement for CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity on chromatin templates assembled with nucleosomes lacking their amino-terminal tails. Together, these data indicate that the KIX domain of CBP/p300 is essential for targeting the acetyltransferase activity of the coactivator to the Tax-CREB (Tax/CREB) complex. Significantly, these observations reveal the presence of one or more CBP/p300 acetyltransferase targets that function specifically on chromatin templates, are independent of the histone tails, and are critical to Tax transactivation.","['Georges, Sara A', 'Giebler, Holli A', 'Cole, Philip A', 'Luger, Karolin', 'Laybourn, Paul J', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Georges SA', 'Giebler HA', 'Cole PA', 'Luger K', 'Laybourn PJ', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biotin/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Streptavidin/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Xenopus laevis/metabolism']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.10.3392-3404.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 May;23(10):3392-404. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.10.3392-3404.2003.,,,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-10A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM062437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 87540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 62437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC164760,,,,,,,

After chromatin immunoprecipitation using an H3-Lys9 methylated antibody, we cloned the recovered DNA and sequenced 47 independent clones. Of these, 38 clones (81%) contained repetitive elements, either short interspersed transposable element (SINE or Alu elements), long terminal repeat (LTR), long interspersed transposable element (LINE), or satellite region (ALR/Alpha) DNA, and three additional clones were near Alu elements. Further characterization of these repetitive elements revealed that 32 clones (68%) were Alu repeats, corresponding to both old Alu (23 clones) and young Alu (9 clones) subfamilies. Association of H3-Lys9 methylation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR using conserved Alu primers. In addition, we randomly selected 5 Alu repeats from the recovered clones and confirmed association with H3-Lys9 by PCR using primer sets flanking the Alu elements. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine rapidly decreased the level of H3-Lys9 methylation in the Alu elements, suggesting that H3-Lys9 methylation may be related to the suppression of Alu elements through DNA methylation. Thus H3-Lys9 methylation is enriched at human repetitive elements, particularly Alu elements, and may play a role in the suppression of recombination by these elements.","['Kondo, Yutaka', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Kondo Y', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), OnM transiently elevates mRNA encoding for suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). By 1 h of OnM treatment, HUVEC become refractory to the restimulation by OnM, measured as failure to reinduce SOCS-3 mRNA. OnM-induced desensitization also prevents responses to other gp130-signaling cytokines (e.g. leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin 11). OnM treatment does not affect gp130 expression levels and desensitizes signaling mediated by a transduced chimeric receptor containing extracellular domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRbeta) and the cytoplasmic region of gp130. Interestingly, a chimeric PDGFRbeta-gp130 mutant receptor, in which intracellular Tyr residue 759 of gp130 is replaced by a Phe residue, mediates prolonged signaling and is not cross-desensitized by OnM. Phospho-Tyr759 is the binding site for both SOCS-3 and for Src homology domain 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2). In human aortic smooth muscle cells, neither prevention of SOCS-3 protein induction, using STAT3 or SOCS-3 antisense, nor prevention of SHP-2 expression, also with antisense, ablates desensitization. These data suggest that desensitization of vascular cells to OnM is mediated in trans and involves Tyr residue 759 in gp130 but is not mediated by either SOCS-3 or SHP-2, the only two proteins currently known to bind to gp130 at this site.","['Mahboubi, Keyvan', 'Kirkiles-Smith, Nancy C', 'Karras, Jim', 'Pober, Jordan S']","['Mahboubi K', 'Kirkiles-Smith NC', 'Karras J', 'Pober JS']","['Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tyrosine', 'src Homology Domains']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/08/19 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M211867200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86965-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jul 4;278(27):25014-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M211867200.

Many statistical methods for feature (gene) selection such as stepwise optimization and Monte Carlo simulation have been developed for tissue sample classification. In contrast to class prediction, few statistical and computational methods for feature selection have been applied to clustering algorithms for pattern discovery. RESULTS: An integrated scheme and corresponding program SamCluster for automatic discovery of sample classes based on gene expression profile is presented in this report. The scheme incorporates the feature selection algorithms based on the calculation of CV (coefficient of variation) and t-test into hierarchical clustering and proceeds as follows. At first, the genes with their CV greater than the pre-specified threshold are selected for cluster analysis, which results in two putative sample classes. Then, significantly differentially expressed genes in the two putative sample classes with p-values < or = 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 from t-test are selected for further cluster analysis. The above processes were iterated until the two stable sample classes were found. Finally, the consensus sample classes are constructed from the putative classes that are derived from the different CV thresholds, and the best putative sample classes that have the minimum distance between the consensus classes and the putative classes are identified. To evaluate the performance of the feature selection for cluster analysis, the proposed scheme was applied to four expression datasets COLON, LEUKEMIA72, LEUKEMIA38, and OVARIAN. The results show that there are only 5, 1, 0, and 0 samples that have been misclassified, respectively. We conclude that the proposed scheme, SamCluster, is an efficient method for discovery of sample classes using gene expression profile.

Localization of donor-derived cells (""chimerism"") has recently been shown to occur in the lungs of mice after either hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or infusion of cultured marrow. To determine whether tissues of the human lung might be similarly derived from extrapulmonary sources, we examined lung specimens from a retrospective cohort of female allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who received stem cells from male donors. Tissue samples from three such patients who had undergone diagnostic lung biopsy or autopsy were examined. Slides were stained by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin (epithelium) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, CD31 (PECAM) (endothelium) and were imaged and then examined by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis to identify male cells. The resulting overlapping in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry images were examined for the presence and, if present, cell type of donor cells in the lung. We found significant rates of epithelial (2.5-8.0%) and endothelial (37.5-42.3%) chimerism.

Studies were conducted on a series of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Results showed that water soluble compounds (aucubin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and vanillic acid) exhibited a weak antileukemic activity (IC50: 26-56 microg/ml, SI: 2-11). On the other hand, water insoluble compounds such as triterpenoids (oleanolic acid and ursolic acid), monoterpene (linalool) and flavonoid (luteolin) possessed strong activity against human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Among them, linalool showed the strongest activity against histiocytic lymphoma cells U937 (IC50: 3.51 microg/ml, SI: 592.6) and Burkitt lymphoma cells P3HR1 (IC50: 4.21 microg/ml, SI: 494.1).

Its curative potential is based on two very different mechanisms, involving the conditioning regimen and the graft-versus-host reactions, respectively. The high-dose chemo-radiotherapy conditioning regimen is aimed at destroying tumor cells, ablating the host immune system (to prevent rejection) and eliminating the host bone marrow (to ""make space"" for donor stem cells). However, the definitive eradication of tumor cells is also largely mediated by an immune-mediated destruction of malignant cells by donor lymphocytes termed graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) or graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect. However, because of its toxicity, conventional allogeneic HSCT is restricted to younger (< 55 years) and fitter patients. These observations led several groups to set up new (less toxic) transplant protocols based on a two step approach: first the use of immunosuppressive (but nonmyeloablative) conditioning regimens providing sufficient immunosuppression to achieve engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells and, in a second step, destruction of malignant cells by the GVL effect. These transplants are called nonmyeloablative HSCT or reduced-conditioning HSCT or minitransplants. Preliminary results show that minitransplants are feasible with a relatively low transplant-related mortality (TRM) even in patients up to 70 years. In addition, strong anti-tumor responses are observed in several hematological malignancies as well as in some patients with renal cell carcinoma. As the benefits of minitransplants over alternative forms of treatment remain to be demonstrated, this strategy should be restricted to patients included in clinical trials.","['Beguin, Y', 'Baron, F']","['Beguin Y', 'Baron F']","['University of Liege, Department of Hematology, CHU Sart-Tilman, Belgium. yves.beguin@chu.ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",39,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/acb.2003.58.1.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 2003 Jan-Feb;58(1):37-45. doi: 10.1179/acb.2003.58.1.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the application of scrape cytology in the diagnosis of ovarian lesions occurring during a 16-mo period at one institution. The cytologic diagnosis was primarily based on findings in air-dried, Diff-Quik-stained smears in correlation with clinical and intraoperative findings. In total, 131 histologically proven ovarian lesions, including 13 nonneoplastic lesions, 47 benign tumors, 17 epithelial tumors of low malignant potential (LMP), and 54 malignant tumors (35 primary, 1 leukemia, and 18 metastases), were cytologically examined. The accuracy of scrape cytology was 95% in the benign, 47% in the LMP, and 98% in the malignant group. In the LMP group, the false-negative rate was 12%, while the deferred rate and false-positive rate were 24% and 18%, respectively. There was no misdiagnosis between the benign and malignant categories. The histologic subtypes were correctly predicted in 78% of cases. There were limitations of scrape cytology in the diagnosis of LMP and mucinous tumors, which require histologic architectural evaluation and adequate histologic sampling. Scrape cytology is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive adjunctive technique that should be used in intraoperative consultation for ovarian lesions.","['Khunamornpong, Surapan', 'Siriaunkgul, Sumalee']","['Khunamornpong S', 'Siriaunkgul S']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. skhunamo@mail.med.cmu.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,IM,"['*Cytodiagnosis/methods', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Ovarian Diseases/*pathology/*surgery', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/12/25 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dc.10273 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2003 May;28(5):250-7. doi: 10.1002/dc.10273.,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we expressed the KSHV vMIP-I and vMIP-II proteins and analyzed their biological functions. Both vMIP-I and vMIP-II had an apparent molecular mass of 7.8 kDa and were localized to the cytoplasm in a body cavity-based lymphoma cell line BC-3, stimulated with phorbol ester. We next treated a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, with purified recombinant vMIP-I and vMIP-II, or vMIP-I and vMIP-II fused with alkaline phosphatase to study Ca(2+) signalling and in vitro chemotaxis in response to these proteins. Calcium mobilization was induced by both vMIP-I and vMIP-II. Furthermore, vMIP-I and vMIP-II induced Ca(2+) mobilization in K562 cells expressing the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), suggesting that both may be agonistic for CCR5. Additionally, vMIP-I induced Ca(2+) mobilization through the intermediary of CCR8. These viral MIPs were also capable of chemotactically activating the THP-1 cells. These results imply that vMIP-I and vMIP-II may play important roles in the propagation of KS and primary effusion lymphoma by inducing the chemotaxis of CCR5-expressing monocytes.","['Nakano, K', 'Isegawa, Y', 'Zou, P', 'Tadagaki, K', 'Inagi, R', 'Yamanishi, K']","['Nakano K', 'Isegawa Y', 'Zou P', 'Tadagaki K', 'Inagi R', 'Yamanishi K']","['Department of Microbiology C1, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (CCL1 protein, human)', '0 (CCL11 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL1)', '0 (Chemokine CCL11)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL1', 'Chemokine CCL11', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines, CC/pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Monokines/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/virology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00705-002-0971-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 2003 May;148(5):871-90. doi: 10.1007/s00705-002-0971-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These concentrations have been shown to saturate the intracellular accumulation of the active triphosphate metabolite. We designed this pharmacokinetic study to assess the ability of a fixed dose rate of gemcitabine to achieve the desired steady-state concentration in the absence and presence of paclitaxel in patients with solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 14 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer received paclitaxel 110 mg/m(2) over 3 h on days 1 and 8 and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) over 80 min on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Patients received gemcitabine alone on cycle (C) 1, day (D) 1. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 80 min during infusion and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after infusion on C1D1, C1D8, C2D1, C4D1 and C6D1. RESULTS: Of 13 patients included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, 61% achieved the desired steady-state concentration (C(ss)) with gemcitabine alone (C1D1), whereas only 0 to 45% of patients achieved the desired C(ss) with paclitaxel and gemcitabine, depending on the treatment cycle. Paclitaxel significantly decreased systemic clearance (Cl(T); P=0.012) and volume of distribution (V(d); P=0.050) and significantly increased C(ss) ( P=0.009). Gemcitabine plasma pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated great interpatient variability in the absence of paclitaxel (C(ss) 30%, Cl(T) 30%, V(d) 55%). Interpatient and intrapatient variability in gemcitabine pharmacokinetics were not observed when gemcitabine was administered in combination with paclitaxel (P>0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The majority of the 264 children were being treated for ALL. According to the NOPHO-92 protocol, 5 or 8 g MTX/m(2) was administered over 24 h. Serum creatinine was assessed daily. In 11 patients from one centre, renal function was studied in more detail using serum cystatin C, iohexol clearance, and urinary albumin, IgG and protein HC. RESULTS: Increased serum creatinine correlated significantly with the elimination time of MTX, whereas no indications were found of tubular or barrier function damage. Of the 1164 courses, 44 had delayed elimination of MTX (>/=120 h). Serum MTX >150 microM at the end of infusion had a sensitivity of 0.27 and a specificity of 0.94 to predict delayed MTX elimination, and >/=50% increase in serum creatinine during the first treatment day (creatinine ratio) had a sensitivity of 0.32 and a specificity of 0.99. The corresponding risk ratios were 5 and 19 for MTX >150 micro M and creatinine ratio, respectively. In courses with a normal elimination time (<72 h), 99% of the courses had a rise in serum creatinine of less than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of serum creatinine by more than 50% is a better predictor of delayed elimination than the level of serum MTX at the end of MTX infusion, especially if information on previous creatinine measurements is used to reduce the impact of an occasionally low serum creatinine value before the start of the MTX infusion.","['Skarby, T', 'Jonsson, P', 'Hjorth, L', 'Behrentz, M', 'Bjork, O', 'Forestier, E', 'Jarfelt, M', 'Lonnerholm, G', 'Hoglund, P']","['Skarby T', 'Jonsson P', 'Hjorth L', 'Behrentz M', 'Bjork O', 'Forestier E', 'Jarfelt M', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Hoglund P']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Lund University Hospital, 221 85 Lund, Sweden. tor.skarby@klinfarm.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/*drug effects', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', '*Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Time Factors', 'Urinalysis']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2002/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0552-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Apr;51(4):311-20. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0552-1.

The in vitro activity of etoposide (0-10 microM) was investigated in a panel of leukaemic cell lines. METHODS: Cells were cultured with etoposide in drug schedules of equal exposure duration (ED, durationxconcentration), and the effects of drug exposure on cell parameters, including cell cycle distribution, were assessed over an 8-day period. RESULTS: Proliferation assays indicated a concentration- and duration-dependent induction of cell death by etoposide in CEM and HL60 cells, and flow cytometric analysis indicated that this cell kill was by apoptosis. Efficacy was also dependent upon schedule, with more cell kill seen in schedules of longer duration. As an example, accumulative percent cell kill resulting from a continuous exposure to 0.05 microM etoposide was significantly greater than that in cultures involving either a 4-day exposure to 0.1 microM or a single-day exposure to 0.4 microM etoposide (193.4+/-15.9% vs 125.2+/-5.4% vs 42.3+/-5.9%, respectively; P<0.001 in all cases; equi-ED 0.4 microM.days). Efficacy was also dependent upon the ED of the schedule. At very low concentrations, the initial enhancement of cytotoxicity mediated by increasing duration would gradually and paradoxically be lost in the more protracted schedules (e.g. accumulative percent cell kill 66.4+/-7.4%, 158.3+/-12.0% and 40.1+/-6.0% with 100 n M for 2 days, 33 n M for 6 days and 25 n M for 8 days, respectively; P<0.001 in all cases; equi-ED 0.2 microM x days). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the schedule-dependency of etoposide in vitro, highlighting the importance of total duration of drug exposure in determining cytotoxicity, and emphasizing the requirement to achieve a cytotoxic concentration in longer exposures. It is therefore crucial to ensure that etoposide regimens used clinically involve doses that are effectively cytotoxic.","['Liu, Wai M', 'Joel, Simon P']","['Liu WM', 'Joel SP']","[""New Drug Study Group, Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 38 Little Britain, West Smithfield, London, EC1A 7BE, UK. w.a.i.liu@qmul.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2002/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0579-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Apr;51(4):291-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0579-y.

In the current study, we investigated whether TAM induces apoptosis in tumor cells by altering the expression of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL). METHODS: Several tumor cell lines were used to test the ability of TAM to induce apoptosis, which was studied using the TUNEL assay. The effect of TAM on the expression of Fas and FasL was analyzed using a flow cytometer. RESULTS: TAM was found to suppress the growth of an estrogen receptor-positive human mammary tumor cell line (T-47D) by inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, TAM also induced apoptosis in an estrogen receptor-negative murine T cell lymphoma cell line, EL-4. The ability of TAM to induce apoptosis in T-47D and EL-4 tumor cells correlated with the increased expression of FasL but not Fas on the tumor cells. Similar to TAM, a metalloproteinase (MP) inhibitor, which is known to increase the expression of membrane-bound FasL, was found to induce apoptosis in both T-47D and EL-4 tumor cells by increasing the expression of FasL but not Fas. Furthermore, both TAM and the MP inhibitor failed to induce apoptosis in L1210 tumor cell lines that failed to express FasL. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that TAM can induce apoptosis in Fas(+) tumor cells by upregulating FasL.","['Nagarkatti, Nisha', 'Davis, Barbara A']","['Nagarkatti N', 'Davis BA']","['Molecular Nutrition Laboratory, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Faslg protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (N-(2(R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl)-L-tryptophan', 'methylamide)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Metalloendopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*biosynthesis']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2002/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0581-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Apr;51(4):284-90. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0581-4.

The recent availability of an increasing number of active monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, and radioimmunoconjugates (RICs) has stimulated considerable interest in clinical research in CLL. Alemtuzumab was the first antibody approved for CLL on the basis of responses in one third of patients with advanced disease. However, infusion reactions and immunosuppression with opportunistic infections present a challenge that may be overcome with altered schedules and routes of administration. Rituximab has limited activity as a single agent in patients relapsed or refractory after prior chemotherapy; however, response rates seem to be higher in previously untreated patients. More importantly, combinations with chemotherapy drugs such as fludarabine are showing promise in early trials. Newer antibodies in development as single agents and in combinations include apolizumab (Hu1D10), a humanized antibody against an epitope of HLA-DR, and IDEC-152, a primatized anti-CD23 antibody. BL22, an immunotoxin with impressive activity in hairy cell leukemia, is in phase II trials in CLL as well. The safe use of RICs is complicated by the elevated peripheral blood B-cell count, and the extent of bone marrow involvement in CLL; studies will explore the use of agents to eliminate malignant cells from the bone marrow before RIC therapy. It is hoped that the rational development of combinations of the various promising antibodies with chemotherapy and each other will lead to more effective approaches for patients with CLL.","['Mavromatis, Blanche', 'Cheson, Bruce D']","['Mavromatis B', 'Cheson BD']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University Hospital, 3800 Reservoir Rd., N.W., Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy']",92,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.09.113 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.09.113 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 May 1;21(9):1874-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.09.113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status < or = 2 and refractory solid tumors. Initially, patients received ZD9331 daily for 2 weeks, with the duration of treatment escalated to a maximum of 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. Once the maximum-tolerated duration of treatment was determined, the dose of ZD9331 was increased until DLT occurred. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled at eight dose levels. The DLTs were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. At 3 mg/d, two of 19 patients developed DLT; one patient had grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 4 neutropenia, and the other patient had grade 3 thrombocytopenia only. Anemia was common, with a median hemoglobin nadir of 75% of baseline, before recovery or transfusion. The apparent oral clearance of ZD9931 was 11.6 +/- 6.3 mL/min. Dose-limiting myelosuppression was associated with both an increased 24-hour ZD9931 concentration and blood urea nitrogen. CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose on this schedule is 3 mg/d for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. ZD9331 seems to have a manageable toxicity profile, although it should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.","['Sawyer, Michael B', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Bertucci, Donna', 'Smith, Robert P', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Shulman, Keith', 'Douglass, Edwin C', 'Fleming, Gini F']","['Sawyer MB', 'Ratain MJ', 'Bertucci D', 'Smith RP', 'Schilsky RL', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Shulman K', 'Douglass EC', 'Fleming GF']","['Committe on Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Center and Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, IL USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (ZD 9331)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.01.148 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.01.148 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 May 1;21(9):1859-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.01.148.,,,['CA 14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy differences for three regimens that are based on adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) are presented in this article, but cancer recurrence sites, time of relapse, subsequent primary cancers, and causes of death in the natural history of node-positive breast cancer are emphasized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Beginning in 1975, 905 patients with node-positive cancer were randomly assigned to receive CMF or two regimens of CMF plus other agents. Median follow-up is 22.6 years. The natural-history analysis was performed on a subset of 814 patients. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the 599 women known to have died, died of metastatic breast cancer. Only 8.5% of the deceased women died of a cause other than breast cancer, a second or third cancer, or adjuvant chemotherapy toxicity. One hundred five women (12.8%) developed other primary cancers, with 49 (46.6%) occurring in the contralateral breast. Therapeutic efficacy differences of the CMF regimens reported earlier have been maintained more than 20 years later. For certain subsets, the five-drug regimen had advantages over CMF. Bone was the most common recurrence site. The longest interval to relapse has been 23.5 years, and 18% of those who relapsed did so more than 10 years later. CONCLUSION: Despite adjuvant chemotherapy, a large majority (80%) of women with node-positive breast cancer die of the disease, and many recurrences develop more than 10 years later. CMF plus vincristine and prednisone provides a benefit compared with CMF, but the magnitude varies with the number of involved nodes. Outcome trends in earlier analyses of this study were maintained even years later.","['Weiss, Raymond B', 'Woolf, Susan H', 'Demakos, Erin', 'Holland, James F', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Falkson, Geoffrey', 'Cirrincione, Constance T', 'Robbins, Alice', 'Bothun, Sandra', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry']","['Weiss RB', 'Woolf SH', 'Demakos E', 'Holland JF', 'Berry DA', 'Falkson G', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Robbins A', 'Bothun S', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L']","['Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with histologically confirmed stage IV breast cancer, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance status 0 to 2, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive CAF (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 day 1, and fluorouracil [FU] 200 mg/m2 intravenous bolus days 1 to 5) with or without LV (LV 200 mg/m2 over 30 minutes days 1 to 5 given 1 hour before FU). RESULTS: Two hundred forty-two patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 124 patients had visceral crisis and 40 patients had a CALGB performance status score of 2. The median follow-up was 6 years. The two study arms were similar with regard to serious adverse events; four patients died from treatment-related causes, two patients on each study arm. Predictive variables for time to treatment failure and survival were visceral disease and performance status. The overall response rate was 29% for CAF versus 28% for CAF plus LV. The median time to treatment failure (9 months) and median survival (1.7 years) did not differ by treatment arm. CONCLUSION: Modulation of CAF with LV improved neither response rates nor survival among women with metastatic breast cancer, compared with CAF alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were sought for each individual patient in all trials started in or before 1993 that included unconfounded randomized comparisons of such treatments. Log-rank survival analyses were performed for each trial, and overall results for groups of trials addressing similar questions were obtained from the totals of the observed minus expected number of events and their variances. RESULTS: Radiotherapy and long-term intrathecal therapy gave similar outcomes, with no significant difference in event-free survival despite random assignment of treatment to 2,848 patients, 1,001 of whom suffered relapse or death. Intravenous methotrexate reduced non-CNS rather than CNS relapses, and hence, the addition of intravenous methotrexate to a treatment regimen including radiotherapy or long-term intrathecal therapy improved event-free survival, with a 17% reduction in the event rate (95% confidence interval, 6% to 27%; P =.003). The event-free survival at 10 years in these trials was 61.9% without intravenous methotrexate and 68.1% with intravenous methotrexate. There was no significant difference in survival (14% death rate reduction; P =.09). There were insufficient randomly assigned patients to adequately address other questions, such as effect of different doses. No evidence was found of differences, between trials or between subgroups of different types of patients, in the relative effects of treatment. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy can be replaced by long-term intrathecal therapy. Intravenous methotrexate gives some additional benefit by reducing non-CNS relapses.","['Clarke, M', 'Gaynon, P', 'Hann, I', 'Harrison, G', 'Masera, G', 'Peto, R', 'Richards, S']","['Clarke M', 'Gaynon P', 'Hann I', 'Harrison G', 'Masera G', 'Peto R', 'Richards S']","['Clinical Trial Service Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford OX2 6HE, United Kingdom. all.overview@ctsu.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.08.047 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.08.047 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 May 1;21(9):1798-809. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.08.047.,,,,,['Childhood ALL Collaborative Group'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 778) with newly diagnosed ALL, 2 to 9 years of age at diagnosis with an initial WBC count less than 10,000/microL, were eligible for this protocol. All patients received induction, consolidation, and interim maintenance phases of therapy over the first 16 weeks. At week 16, patients remaining in remission were randomly assigned to receive or not receive a single 7-week delayed intensification (DI) phase of therapy. Maintenance therapy was given in lieu of or after DI, with total duration of therapy approximately 3 years for boys and 2 years for girls. RESULTS: Patients randomized to receive DI experienced fewer relapse events in all categories. Kaplan-Meier life-table estimates for continuous complete remission (CCR) at 7 years for the randomized regimens were 77% (SE, 2.4%) for the standard regimen and 83% (SE, 2.7%) for the DI regimen (P =.072). The only prognostic factor of significance post-randomization in this selected low-risk population was the day 14 marrow response (P =.0001).

All patients were required to have one or more indications for treatment. Patients with objective response or stable disease continued to receive identical 4-week rituximab courses at 6-month intervals, for a total of four courses. RESULTS: The objective response rate after the first course of rituximab was 51% (4% complete responses). Twenty-eight patients received one or more additional courses of rituximab. At present, the overall response rate is 58%, with 9% complete responses. After a median follow-up of 20 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 18.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 62% and 49%, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated, with only two episodes of grade 3 to 4 infusion-related toxicity. No cumulative toxicity or opportunistic infections occurred. CONCLUSION: Single-agent rituximab, used at a standard dose and schedule, is active in the first-line treatment of patients with CLL/SLL, producing substantially higher response rates than previously reported in relapsed or refractory patients (51% v 13%, respectively). Re-treatment with rituximab at 6-month intervals is well tolerated. The PFS time of 18.6 months in patients with CLL/SLL seems shorter than the 36- to 40-month median PFSs previously reported with first-line plus maintenance rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma. Additional follow-up is required to fully assess the impact of this treatment strategy.","['Hainsworth, John D', 'Litchy, Sharlene', 'Barton, John H', 'Houston, Gerry Ann', 'Hermann, Robert C', 'Bradof, James E', 'Greco, F Anthony']","['Hainsworth JD', 'Litchy S', 'Barton JH', 'Houston GA', 'Hermann RC', 'Bradof JE', 'Greco FA']","['Sarah Cannon Cancer Center and Tennessee Oncology, Professional Limited Liability Corporation, Nashville, TN 37203, USA. jhainsworth@tnonc.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.09.027 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.09.027 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 May 1;21(9):1746-51. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.09.027.,,,,,['Minnie Pearl Cancer Research Network'],,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective, randomized study was conducted in patients aged 50 years or older with untreated, adverse karyotype, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to assess troxacitabine-based regimes as induction therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive idarubicin and ara-C (IA) versus troxacitabine and ara-C (TA) versus troxacitabine and idarubicin (TI). A Bayesian design was used to adaptively randomly assign patients to treatment. Thus, although there was initially an equal chance for randomization to IA, TA, or TI, treatment arms with a higher success rate progressively received a greater proportion of patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were treated. Randomization to TI stopped after five patients and randomization to TA stopped after 11 patients. Defining success as complete remission (CR) that occurred within 49 days of starting treatment, success rates were 55% (10 of 18 patients) with IA, 27% (three of 11 patients) with TA, and 0% (zero of five patients) with TI. Because three CRs occurred after day 49, final CR rates were 55% (10 of 18 patients) with IA, 45% (five of 11 patients) with TA, and 20% (one of five patients) with TI. The probability that TA was inferior to IA was 70%, with a 5% probability that TA would have a 20% higher CR rate than IA. Survival was equivalent with all three regimens. CONCLUSION: Neither troxacitabine combination was superior to IA in elderly patients with previously untreated adverse karyotype AML.","['Giles, Francis J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wathen, Jay K', 'Xiao, Lian-Chun', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes JE', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Verstovsek S', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas DA', 'Ferrajoli A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wathen JK', 'Xiao LC', 'Berry DA', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Leukemia, Box 428, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Dioxolanes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.11.016 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.11.016 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 May 1;21(9):1722-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.11.016.,,,,,,,,,,['Curr Oncol Rep. 2003 Sep;5(5):390.

Application to publicly available yeast and human lymphoma data demonstrates the reliability of the method in spite of its simplicity, especially with respect to the small number of parameters involved.

Although the precise cellular mechanisms underlying these morphometric changes remain to be fully elucidated, the data suggest that severe mood disorders are associated with impairments of structural plasticity and cellular resilience. It is thus noteworthy that lithium and valproate have recently been demonstrated to robustly increase the expression of the cytoprotective protein bcl-2 (an abbreviation for the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene) in the CNS in vivo and in cells of human neuronal origin. Lithium and valproate also robustly activate a signaling cascade utilized by endogenous growth factors-the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Complementary human studies have shown that chronic lithium administration significantly increases gray matter content in a regionally selective manner, suggesting a reversal of illness-related atrophy and an increase in the volume of the neuropil. These unique and unexpected properties of lithium and valproate suggest that they may have broader utility as adjunctive agents in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with cell atrophy or loss. The adjunctive use of these agents-at low doses-may provide the trophic support necessary to restore, enhance, and maintain normal synaptic connectivity, thereby allowing the chemical signal to reinstate the optimal functioning of critical circuits necessary for normal functioning.","['Gray, Neil A', 'Zhou, Rulun', 'Du, Jing', 'Moore, Gregory J', 'Manji, Husseini K']","['Gray NA', 'Zhou R', 'Du J', 'Moore GJ', 'Manji HK']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Psychiatry,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,7801243,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)']",IM,"['Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Atrophy', 'Brain/*drug effects/*physiology/physiopathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, bcl-2/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lithium/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Mood Disorders/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neurons/drug effects/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",139,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Psychiatry. 2003;64 Suppl 5:3-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Column chromatography combined with cytotoxic bioassay-guided fractionation was performed to isolate the antitumor principles from fresh leaves of M. rubravar. acuminata. The 20% MeOH eluate fraction of M. rubra var. acuminata inhibited the viability of HeLa and P-388 cells in an in vitro assay and an in vivo P-388 tumor-bearing CDF(1) mouse model. The percent increase in life span (%ILS) of 20% MeOH eluate fraction was greater than 125%. (-)-Epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (1) and prodelphinidin A-2,3'-O-gallate (2) were isolated from D-20 as the antitumor principle components. Both compounds can inhibit the growth of HeLa cells, but 1 had lower cytotoxic effects in normal cervical fibroblasts than did 2. Moreover, pretreatment with a caspase-3 specific inhibitor prevented 1- and 2-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In view of these results, we suggest that 1 and 2 can induce apoptosis in HeLa cells and that activation of caspase-3 may provide a mechanistic explanation for their cytotoxic effects. Therefore, we suggest that the 20% MeOH eluate fraction extract is good for health and that M. rubra var. acuminata is an economically valuable plant.","['Yang, Ling-Ling', 'Chang, Chia-Chen', 'Chen, Lih-Geeng', 'Wang, Ching-Chiung']","['Yang LL', 'Chang CC', 'Chen LG', 'Wang CC']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy, Taipei Medical University, 250 Wu-Hsing Street, Taipei 110, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', ""0 (prodelphinidin B-2 3'-O-gallate)"", '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthocyanins/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cervix Uteri/cytology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Methanol', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Middle Aged', 'Myrica/*chemistry', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry']",,2003/05/02 05:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/05/02 05:00'],"['2003/05/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf026188i [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2003 May 7;51(10):2974-9. doi: 10.1021/jf026188i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some rodent models, lytic CD45 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) induce complete marrow aplasia. In others, only transient myelolymphodepletion are observed, which are nonetheless sufficient to permit engraftment with fully allogeneic stem cells after otherwise ineffective doses of radiation. The in vivo effects of unconjugated cytolytic CD45 MAbs on myeloid and lymphoid cells in humans are unknown, so it is unclear if they could contribute in a similar way to conventional ablative or to nonmyeloablative preparative regimens used for stem cell transplantation (SCT). We therefore assessed the safety, myeloreductive activities, and lymphoreductive activities of the unconjugated rat anti-human CD45 MAbs, YTH25.4 and YTH54.12, in subjects who were to undergo SCT for advanced hematologic malignancy. The MAb pair bind to contiguous but nonoverlapping epitopes on CD45 and work synergistically to fix complement and recruit cellular lytic mechanisms. The MAbs were given in increasing doses up to 1600 microg/kg during 4 days, after which the patients began their conventional transplantation preparative regimen. The maximum tolerated dose of these MAbs, 400 microg/kg/d, produced marked reduction in circulating lymphoid and myeloid cells while largely sparing marrow progenitors. In 2 of 3 patients who had active leukemia at the time of study, the MAbs reduced the percentage of leukemic blast cells in bone marrow. Seven of 14 patients are disease free 610 to 1555 days post-SCT. The in vivo myeloreductive and lymphoreductive properties of lytic CD45 MAb in humans, therefore, closely parallel the activity seen in a murine model and, therefore, may be of similar value.","['Krance, Robert A', 'Kuehnle, Ingrid', 'Rill, Donna R', 'Mei, Zhuyong', 'Pinetta, Carl', 'Evans, William', 'Brown, Michael P', 'Pule, Martin', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Brenner, Malcolm K']","['Krance RA', 'Kuehnle I', 'Rill DR', 'Mei Z', 'Pinetta C', 'Evans W', 'Brown MP', 'Pule M', 'Heslop HE', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. rakrance@txccc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/immunology/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2004/01/15 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/bbmt.2003.50024 [doi]', 'S1083879103000351 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Apr;9(4):273-81. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2003.50024.,['Copyright 2003 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation'],,"['R21 CA82101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00188/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine whether donor CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells could control ongoing GVHD, thereby providing an initial window of time in which the alloreactive anti-host response is permitted to begin, with the intent of most effectively eliminating residual leukemia cells. Prevention of lethal GVHD by infusion of donor CD4(+)CD25(+) cells early after HCT (day 2) was achieved across a major histocompatibility complex barrier in the haploidentical C3H-->(B6xC3H)F(1) model. However, in vitro expansion of donor CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, stimulated by recipient cells in the presence of high-dose interleukin-2, was required for successful regulation. In contrast, in the major histocompatibility complex-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen-disparate, CD8-mediated B10.BR-->CBA GVHD model, lethal disease could be completely prevented by a single infusion of freshly isolated donor CD4(+)CD25(+) cells administered as late as 10 days after HCT. Of importance, this late regulatory effect required only a 3:1 ratio of effector CD8:CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, indicating a strong potential for the delayed infusion of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells to control GVHD across minor histocompatibility antigen barriers. Furthermore, this regulation did not interfere with complete and lasting donor engraftment of the hematopoietic compartment. Of most significance, the day 10 infusion of donor CD4(+)CD25(+) cells into CBA HCT recipients that had been challenged with the MMCBA6 myeloid leukemia cell line did not block an effective GVL response, despite reducing lethal GVHD. These results suggest that donor CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells infused soon after transplantation can ameliorate the development of GVHD without sacrificing a sufficient GVL effect.","['Jones, Stephen C', 'Murphy, George F', 'Korngold, Robert']","['Jones SC', 'Murphy GF', 'Korngold R']","['Department of Pathology, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Animal', '*Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2004/01/15 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/bbmt.2003.50027 [doi]', 'S1083879103000636 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Apr;9(4):243-56. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2003.50027.,['Copyright 2003 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation'],,"['CA40358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55593/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report aims to assess whether this strategy stands the passage of time. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the charts of 17 patients aged 5.3 +/- 0.9 years (mean +/- SD) treated at our institution for EP between 1991 and 2001. RESULTS: Nineteen episodes of EP were caused by stricture dilation in 9 cases, foreign body extraction in 3, and blunt trauma and sclerosis of varices in 2 cases each. The remaining child had multiple gastrointestinal perforations in the course of chemotherapy for leukemia. Vigorous treatment, consisting of nasopharyngeal aspiration, wide spectrum antibiotics, prompt drainage of effusions and either parenteral or infraesophageal nutritition, was implemented immediately after diagnosis. Perforations were closed without direct surgery in 18 of 19 episodes (16 of 17 children). One or more pleural drains were inserted in 12 cases, and pericardial drainage was required once. Seven gastrostomies, 2 jejunostomies, and one esophagostomy were performed. Several major abdominal operations were necessary to repair concomitant lesions in a child who sustained severe blunt abdominal trauma and in the patient with leukemic perforations. All patients survived, and all recovered esophageal function. However, 2 with intractable lye strictures ultimately required esophageal replacement. The only patient in whom a direct approach for esophageal necrosis due to variceal endosclerosis was unavoidable, lost her organ and had a retrosternal colonic interposition after a successful portosystemic shunt. Excluding patients with other concomitant lesions and the patient who underwent surgery, median length of stay was 11 days (range, 6 to 47). CONCLUSIONS: Prompt and aggressive nonoperative treatment of esophageal perforations in children allows survival with conservation of the organ in most cases and remains, in the authors' hands, the first therapeutic choice at this age.","['Martinez, L', 'Rivas, S', 'Hernandez, F', 'Avila, L F', 'Lassaletta, L', 'Murcia, J', 'Olivares, P', 'Queizan, A', 'Fernandez, A', 'Lopez-Santamaria, M', 'Tovar, J A']","['Martinez L', 'Rivas S', 'Hernandez F', 'Avila LF', 'Lassaletta L', 'Murcia J', 'Olivares P', 'Queizan A', 'Fernandez A', 'Lopez-Santamaria M', 'Tovar JA']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Abdominal Injuries/complications/surgery', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Esophageal Perforation/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*therapy', 'Esophagoscopes/adverse effects', 'Esophagus/diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/jpsu.2003.50183 [doi]', 'S0022346803000277 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2003 May;38(5):685-9. doi: 10.1016/jpsu.2003.50183.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Bcl-2 protein inhibits apoptosis and confers resistance to treatment with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies. Oblimersen sodium (G3139, Genasense, Genta Inc, Berkeley Heights, NJ) is an antisense oligonucleotide compound designed to specifically bind to the first six codons of the human bcl-2 mRNA sequence, resulting in degradation of bcl-2 mRNA and subsequent decrease in Bcl-2 protein translation. Oblimersen is the first oligonucleotide to demonstrate proof of principle of an antisense effect in human tumors by the documented downregulation of the target Bcl-2 protein. A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that oblimersen synergizes with many cytotoxic and biologic/immunotherapeutic agents against a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Randomized clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oblimersen in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), malignant melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, nonrandomized trials are underway to evaluate oblimersen in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Preclinical data support the clinical evaluation of oblimersen in additional tumor types, including chronic myelogenous leukemia, and breast, small cell lung, gastric, colon, bladder (CML), and Merkel cell cancers. Enhancement of the efficacy of anticancer treatments with oblimersen Bcl-2 antisense therapy represents a promising new apoptosis-modulating strategy, and ongoing clinical trials will test this therapeutic approach.","['Frankel, Stanley R']",['Frankel SR'],"['Department of Medicine, Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland at Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Thionucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism']",45,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/sonc.2003.50041 [doi]', 'S0093775403000083 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2003 Apr;30(2):300-4. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2003.50041.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Although its molecular mechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated, thalidomide and the IMiDs affect a variety of cytokines and inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, interferon gamma (IFNgamma), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and COX-2 and angiogenesis factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor. The IMiDs also affect adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and L-CAM, in addition to preferentially stimulating CD8 cells and expanding natural killer (NK) cell populations. Since most IMiDs share these properties, it would be expected that the second-generation IMiDs (REVIMID, ACTIMID) would have activity similar to thalidomide in WM with an improved safety profile. TNFalpha and angiogenesis most likely play a role in promoting the growth and development of WM. The selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelCIDs) are potent phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitors that inhibit TNFalpha production and are highly antiangiogenic. In addition, inhibition of PDE-4 induces apoptosis in human CLL lymphocytes. It is therefore expected that the SelCIDs might have activity in Waldenstrom's tumors. Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a component of signaling cascades that modulate apoptosis, the induction of an inflammatory response via the AP-1 pathway, and modulation of cellular proliferation. In a variety of tumors, including multiple myeloma, JNK is induced as part of a protective mechanism. It is hypothesized that inhibition of JNK activity might allow other chemotherapeutic agents to be more effective in a similar manner to corticosteroids. Work is in progress to evaluate this. Inhibitors of the E3 subunit of ubiquitin ligase may also selectively modulate the expression of receptors, growth factors, and transcription factors essential to the growth, survival, and spread of tumors. We hypothesize that the IMiDs, SelCIDs, JNK inhibitors, and ligase inhibitors will be the basis for a new nonchemotherapeutic approach to the treatment of WM and other related diseases.","['Zeldis, Jerome B', 'Schafer, Peter H', 'Bennett, Brydon L', 'Mercurio, Frank', 'Stirling, David I']","['Zeldis JB', 'Schafer PH', 'Bennett BL', 'Mercurio F', 'Stirling DI']","['Celgen Corp, Warren, NJ 07059, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Lenalidomide', 'Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*drug therapy']",25,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/sonc.2003.50078 [doi]', 'S0093775403000459 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2003 Apr;30(2):275-81. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2003.50078.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

By contrast, for diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) immunophenotyping is used only occasionally. From 150 patients with a IgM monoclonal gammopathy we have selected 60 cases with (1) morphological lymphoplasmocytoid bone marrow (BM) infiltration (>20%); (2) IgM paraprotein (>10g/L); and (3) absence of features of other lymphoma types. Immunophenotypic analysis was based on the use of the triple or quadruple monoclonal antibody (MoAb) combinations. To increase the sensitivity of the analysis of antigen expression, selected CD19(+)CD20(+) B cells were targeted. We have also explored the antigenic characteristics of both the plasma cell (PC) and mast cell (MC) compartments present in the BM from 15 WM patients. Clonal WM lymphocytes were characterized by the constant expression of pan-B markers (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD24) together with sIg, predominantly kappa (5:1, kappa:lambda ratio). A high proportion of cases (75%) were positive for FMC7 and CD25, but in contrast to hairy cell leukemia (HCL), these lymphocytes were always negative for CD103 and CD11c. CD10 antigen was also absent in all WM patients and less than one fifth of patients were positive for CD5 and CD23, while CD27, CD45RA, and BCL-2 were present in most malignant cells. In two cases, the coexistence of two different clones of B lymphocytes was identified, and in eight additional cases, intraclonal phenotypic heterogeneity was observed. As far as PCs are concerned, in most patients (85%) the number of PCs was within the normal range (median, 0.36%). The antigenic profile of these PCs differed from that observed in normal and myelomatous PC (CD38(++)CD19(++/-)CD56(-)CD45(++)CD20(+)). In three cases, PCs showed aberrant expression for CD5, CD22, or FMC7. Finally, the number of mast cells was significantly higher (0.058 +/- 0.13) as compared to normal BM (0.019 +/- 0.02) (P <.01), although they were immunophenotypically normal (CD117(+)CD2(-)CD25(-)).","['San Miguel, J F', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Ocio, E', 'Mateo, G', 'Sanchez-Guijo, F', 'Sanchez, M L', 'Escribano, L', 'Barez, A', 'Moro, M J', 'Hernandez, J', 'Aguilera, C', 'Cuello, R', 'Garcia-Frade, J', 'Lopez, R', 'Portero, J', 'Orfao, A']","['San Miguel JF', 'Vidriales MB', 'Ocio E', 'Mateo G', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Sanchez ML', 'Escribano L', 'Barez A', 'Moro MJ', 'Hernandez J', 'Aguilera C', 'Cuello R', 'Garcia-Frade J', 'Lopez R', 'Portero J', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Lymphocytes', 'Mast Cells', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma Cells', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*immunology/*pathology']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/sonc.2003.50074 [doi]', 'S0093775403000411 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2003 Apr;30(2):187-95. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2003.50074.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We have recently found that the genetic makeup of WM cells is different from that commonly reported for multiple myeloma (MM), follicular lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) translocations could not be detected in any case, and a molecular analysis showed that the IgH locus switch mu retained its germline configuration. Aneuploidy was not detected using chromosome enumeration probes. The only recurrent chromosome abnormality found was deletion of 6q21. The lack of legitimate of illegitimate rearrangements at the IgH locus suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Given the clear evidence of a familial form of WM and the currently presumed genomic stability of the clonal cells, it is likely that a single gene defect may be responsible for disease pathogenesis. Having found deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 as the only recurrent aberration, we speculate that a gene involved in B-cell maturation or survival at this locus may be inactivated as a cause of WM.","['Schop, Roelandt F J', 'Fonseca, Rafael']","['Schop RF', 'Fonseca R']","['Mayo Clinic, Department of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*Immunoglobulin Switch Region', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Mutation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*genetics/pathology']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/sonc.2003.50075 [doi]', 'S0093775403000423 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2003 Apr;30(2):142-5. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2003.50075.,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Since the original description by Jan Waldenstrom of three patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity due to circulating monoclonal IgM, the definition of WM has been controversial. Standardized criteria for diagnosis have now been proposed, including the presence of any IgM monoclonal protein and marrow and/or nodal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Although previous response criteria have generally incorporated parameters for monoclonal protein reduction and/or improvement of marrow/nodal involvement, specific and uniform response criteria are needed to facilitate comparisons of response, remission duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival in clinical trials similar to those previously established for other diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. This is of particular importance as new agents are developed and evaluated.

In 97 patients with hematological malignancies, 181 random leukodepleted platelet transfusions were studied for immunological causes of poor platelet transfusion results by calculating the odds ratio of four different screening tests for a low platelet recovery. Nonimmune causes were also studied by calculating the odds ratio of the most prevalent nonimmune causes for a low platelet recovery. No single screening test showed an association with recovery after 1 and 16 h following a platelet transfusion. The combination of a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and platelet immunofluorescence test (PIFT) or a combination of a positive lymphocyte immunofluorescence test (LIFT) and PIFT, demonstrating an association with a low platelet recovery after 16 h, was present in 2% of all platelet transfusions.

In contrast, no such effect was observed for vincristine, anthracyclines and glucocorticoids. Thus, these latter compounds induce cell death at least in part by p53-independent pathways. Interestingly, p53 mutations clustered in patients who had received prior chemotherapy. In fact, we show for the first time that treatment with DNA-damaging alkylating agents correlates with occurrence of p53 mutations in a clinical setting.

This binding triggers conformational changes in the transmembrane portion of Env, leading to membrane fusion and cell entry, and is thus a major determinant of retrovirus tissue and species tropism. The M813 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is a highly fusogenic gammaretrovirus, isolated from Mus cervicolor, whose host range is limited to mouse cells. To delineate the molecular mechanisms of its restricted host range and its high fusogenic potential, we initiated studies to characterize the cell surface protein that mediates M813 infection. Screening of the T31 mouse-hamster radiation hybrid panel for M813 infectivity localized the receptor gene to the distal end of mouse chromosome 16. Expression of one of the likely candidate genes (slc5a3) within this region in human cells conferred susceptibility to both M813 infection and M813-induced fusogenicity. slc5a3 encodes sodium myo-inositol transporter 1 (SMIT1), thus adding another sodium-dependent transporter to the growing list of proteins used by MuLVs for cell entry. Characterization of SMIT1 orthologues in different species identified several amino acid variations within two extracellular loops that may restrict susceptibility to M813 infection.","['Hein, Sibyll', 'Prassolov, Vladimir', 'Zhang, Yuanming', 'Ivanov, Dmitry', 'Lohler, Jurgen', 'Ross, Susan R', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Hein S', 'Prassolov V', 'Zhang Y', 'Ivanov D', 'Lohler J', 'Ross SR', 'Stocking C']","['Department of Cell and Virus Genetics, Heinrich-Pette-Institute for Experimental ImmunologyVirology, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Symporters)', '146890-04-2 (SLC5A3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Cricetinae', 'Giant Cells/physiology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity/physiology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae/*virology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Symporters/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.10.5926-5932.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 May;77(10):5926-32. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.10.5926-5932.2003.,,,"['R01 CA073746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA73746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['GENBANK/AY231162'],PMC154034,,,,,,,

However, titer varies with target cell type and number, transduction time, and concentration of polycation (e.g., Polybrene). Moreover, because most of the viruses cannot encounter target cells due to Brownian motion, their short half-lives, and the requirement for target cell division for activity, the actual infectious retrovirus concentration in the collected supernatant is higher than the viral titer. Here we correlate the physical viral particle concentration with the infectious virus concentration and colony formation titer with the help of a mathematical model. Ecotropic murine leukemia retrovirus supernatant, collected from the GP+E86/LNCX retroviral vector producer cell line, was concentrated by centrifugation and further purified by a sucrose density gradient. The physical concentration of purified viral vectors was determined by direct particle counting with an electron microscope. The concentrations of fresh and concentrated supernatant were determined by a quantitative reverse transcriptase activity assay. Titration of all supernatants by neomycin-resistant colony formation assay was also performed. There were 767 +/- 517 physical viral particles per infectious CFU in the crude viral supernatant. However, the infectious viral concentration determined by mathematical simulation was 143 viral particles per infectious unit, which is more consistent with the concentration determined by particle counting in purified viral solution. Our results suggest that the mathematical model can be used to extract a more accurate and reliable concentration of infectious retrovirus.","['Kwon, Young Jik', 'Hung, Gene', 'Anderson, W French', 'Peng, Ching-An', 'Yu, Hong']","['Kwon YJ', 'Hung G', 'Anderson WF', 'Peng CA', 'Yu H']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Freezing', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Models, Biological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*isolation & purification/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virology/*methods']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.10.5712-5720.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 May;77(10):5712-20. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.10.5712-5720.2003.,,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC154030,,,,,,,

Exposure of the fetus to diagnostic x rays is reported to increase the risk of childhood leukaemia, and may do so by generating leukaemic fusion genes. Advances in neonatal medicine in the past decade that have extended the limits of viability of preterm babies down to 23 weeks of gestation have resulted in the increased use of diagnostic x rays to monitor neonatal progress. AIM: To investigate whether exposure of very preterm infants to diagnostic x rays in the neonatal period leads to the development of leukaemic fusion genes. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected at birth from very preterm infants (23-30 weeks gestation) and following exposure to diagnostic x rays at intervals of two weeks, until discharge. Cord blood samples from normal full term infants served as controls. Total RNA was extracted from the blood and the expression of the fusion genes TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, and BCR-ABL, characteristic of three subtypes of childhood leukaemia, was investigated in the preterm and full term infant samples using a nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. Serial pre- and post-x ray samples from 42 preterm babies, pre-x ray samples from an additional 46 preterm infants, and cord blood samples from 100 normal full term infants were screened for fusion gene transcripts. RESULTS: No leukaemic fusion gene transcripts were detected in preterm infants following exposure to diagnostic x rays. A BCR-ABL transcript was identified in a single preterm infant prior to x ray exposure. TEL-AML1 transcripts were detected in cord blood samples from two full term infants. MLL-AF4 transcripts were not detected in any of the pre- or full term infants tested. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of the preterm infants to x rays in this small series and at the doses used for diagnostic purposes did not induce leukaemic fusion gene expression, but we cannot exclude the possibility that a small proportion of preterm infants may be unusually sensitive to x rays.","['Ravetto, P F', 'Agarwal, R', 'Chiswick, M L', ""D'Souza, S W"", 'Eden, O B', 'Taylor, G M']","['Ravetto PF', 'Agarwal R', 'Chiswick ML', ""D'Souza SW"", 'Eden OB', 'Taylor GM']","[""University of Manchester, Immunogenetics Laboratory, St Mary's Hospital, Hathersage Road, Manchester M13 0JH, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,Archives of disease in childhood.

Annual surveys including all dairy herds and samples from beef animals were conducted in 1990-2001. Bulk-tank milk samples represented the dairy herds in the surveys; the beef animals were sampled individually at slaughter. The maximum positive herd-level percentage in the surveys was 0.03%. EBL/BLV infection was evenly dispersed in the southern part of the country and nonexistent in the northern part. We conclude that herd-level prevalence of EBL/BLV infection never exceeded 5%. It nevertheless took 30 years to eradicate the disease and the infection. EBL was eradicated from mainland Finland in 1996 and from the island district of Ahvenanmaa in 1999. Annual monitoring of the EBL situation continues.","['Nuotio, L', 'Rusanen, H', 'Sihvonen, L', 'Neuvonen, E']","['Nuotio L', 'Rusanen H', 'Sihvonen L', 'Neuvonen E']","['National Veterinary and Food Research Institute EELA, P.O.

However, there is a scarcity of information on clinical and therapeutic problems associated with pneumococcal infections in other immuno-compromised patients. The objective of this study was to assess the most relevant epidemiologic aspects, clinical features and prognostic factors of pneumococcal bacteremia in immunocompromised hosts without AIDS. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with pneumococcemia, carried out in a 600-bed, university-affiliated hospital in Madrid, Spain. Two-hundred and sixty patients were evaluated retrospectively; 69 (26.5%) immunocompromised patients based on strict case definitions were compared with a group composed of 191 non-immunocompromised hosts with a variety of chronic conditions. Conventional management of pneumococcal bacteremia according to clinical standards was assessed. The MICs of penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, and related mortality and hospital mortality at 30 days, were measured. RESULTS: A comparison of clinical manifestations of pneumococcemia between immunocompromised patients and non-immunocompromised patients did not show differences in the presence of fever, obtundation, type of lung involvement, frequency of primary bacteremia, or meningitis. Hospital-acquired pneumococcemia was significantly more frequent in immunocompromised patients (34.7% versus 6.8%, P<0.0001), and resistance to penicillin was also more common in pneumococcal strains isolated from these patients (37.5% versus 20%, P=0.0009). Septic shock occurred more frequently in immunocompromised patients, although the overall and related mortality were not significantly different from those found in non-immunocompromised patients (33.3% versus 22.5%, P=0.07, and 28.9% versus 20.9%, P=0.7 respectively). In the multivariate analysis, multilobar pneumonia (odds ratio (OR) 15.7; 95% CI 6.00-41.30; P<0.001), inadequate treatment (OR 12.20; 95% CI 4.10-37.20; P<0.001), obtundation (OR 5.80; 95% CI 2.20-15.00; P<0.001) and hospital-acquired bacteremia (OR 4.80; 95% CI 1.00-14.60; P<0.006) were associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with pneumococcemia. Only multilobar pneumonia (OR 7.90; 95% CI 4.10-15.35; P<0.001) was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in immunocompromised patients. Patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma had a greater mortality rate than non-immunocompromised patients (53.8% related mortality, P=0.05). Analysis of these patients showed frequent inadequate empirical therapy with ceftazidime plus amikacin in the presence of beta-lactam resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the burden of pneumococcal bacteremia was attributable to immunosuppressive diseases. In immunocompromised patients, pneumococcemia was frequently acquired within the hospital during the treatment of the underlying condition, and resistance to penicillin was common. Patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma who develop fever and pneumonia should be treated with drugs active against beta-lactam-resistant pneumococci, irrespective of the setting in which the infection develops.","['Fernandez Guerrero, Manuel L', 'Ramos, Jose M', 'Marrero, Jorge', 'Cuenca, Manuel', 'Fernandez Roblas, Ricardo', 'de Gorgolas, Miguel']","['Fernandez Guerrero ML', 'Ramos JM', 'Marrero J', 'Cuenca M', 'Fernandez Roblas R', 'de Gorgolas M']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical Microbiology, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Universidad Autonoma, Avda.

Most patients are diagnosed with advanced stage III/IV disease. Although clinical studies did not prove a clear superiority of anthracyclin-containing combinations, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)-like regimens represent the standard therapeutic approach in MCL. Recent randomized studies have shown a benefit of a combined immunochemotherapy strategy (chemotherapy plus rituximab) increasing the complete and overall response rates, whereas further follow-up is pending for evaluation of the progression-free and overall survival. In patients younger than 65 years, a dose-intensive consolidation comprising high-dose radiochemotherapy and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation after a CHOP-like induction results in an improved progression-free survival. However, despite the benefits of this multimodal approach, most patients relapse even after high-dose therapy. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which may be adapted to the elderly MCL patient cohort by modified dose-reduced conditioning regimens. Prospective randomized trials remain critical to further improve the clinical course of MCL with the addition of newer treatment modalities, such as radioactively labeled antibodies and targeted therapies (eg, flavopiridol and PS-341).","['Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Dreyling, Martin']","['Hiddemann W', 'Dreyling M']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern/LMU, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods']",46,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-003-0023-x [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2003 Jun;4(3):219-26. doi: 10.1007/s11864-003-0023-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
