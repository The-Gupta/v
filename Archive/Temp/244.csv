We assessed the reactivity of 17 CD34 McAbs from the 5th International Workshop on Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens with a variety of cells types: normal bone marrow hemopoietic progenitors, 10 AML, 6 ALL, 11 CML. The reactivity for these McAbs was compared with that of reference CD34 McAbs (Q-Bend 10 and 8G12). For each cell population the % of McAb binding cells, the peak channel and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the positive cells was evaluated. The peak channel, the MFI and the number of positive cells varied significantly from case to case, depending on the McAb and the type of leukemia. According to the spectrum of reactivity three groups of McAbs were defined; however, 7 McAbs do not belong to any of these subgroups. These groups were not entirely in accordance with McAb classification based on enzyme cleavage that identified three epitopes of the CD34 molecule. Some reagents were found to be more specific for AML, other for ALL, CML or normal CD34+ cells. Normal bone marrow light density cells showed a significantly higher percentage of positive cells for 43A1 and MD34.2 McAbs compared to that documented for the remaining McAbs. AML cells showed the most variable pattern of expression for the CD34 McAbs. In leukemic samples, MESF (molecular equivalents of soluble fluorochrome) values ranged from 18,200 to 322,000 and the number of binding sites per cells was 5,000-81,000.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lanza, F', 'Moretti, S', 'Castagnari, B', 'Latorraca, A', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Bardi, A', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Moretti S', 'Castagnari B', 'Latorraca A', 'Rigolin GM', 'Bardi A', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509075299 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:25-30. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classical t(15;17), and inv(16) as well as abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 5 and/or 7 are preferentially associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with T-cell features; the t(8;21)(q22;q22), the Ph chromosome, and 11q23 rearrangements are more frequently found in AML with B-cell features; the Ph chromosome, t11q23 and 14q32 breaks without rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene may be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with myeloid markers. In addition, some chromosome aberrations may be encountered more frequently in acute leukemia with major phenotype deviations than in unselected cases of acute leukemia: namely the Ph chromosome, 11q23 rearrangements, and +13. These chromosome changes appear to be associated with a low complete remission (CR) rate. An association has been documented in some patients with ALL between the presence of the t(9;22) and a minor myeloid component consisting of 5-15% blast cells with myelomonocytic features, raising the possibility that a diagnosis of bilineal acute leukemia would be more appropriate in such cases.

Indeed the use of a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to B and T cells, and myeloid cells, as well as non lineage restricted antigens, permits allocation of more than 98% of acute leukemia to their respective lineage. In ALL, immunophenotyping has established a basis for precise and biologically oriented classification of the disease which may be of prognostic importance. In AML immunological markers are particularly important for identification of acute leukemia with minimal myeloid, erythroblastic or megakaryoblastic differentiation. Immunological markers also allow the identification of acute leukemias with minimal or aberrant marker expression, acute biphenotypic leukemia in which single cells coexpress different lineage associated markers and acute bilineage leukemia where there are two separate blast cell populations (usually lymphoid and myeloid). There is sometimes confusion in the literature about the definition of acute unclassifiable and acute undifferentiated leukemia. This is mainly due to misinterpretation of phenotypic data or to the lack of relevant lineage specific markers in these studies, especially for the detection of cytoplasmic antigens. Indeed, it is important to stress that in hematopoietic precursors, antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies first appear in the cytoplasm during early differentiation and are only expressed on the membrane later. This has been demonstrated not only for the T lineage (Cy CD3), the B lineage (CyCD22) but also for the myeloid lineage (CyCD13).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bernier, M', 'Massy, M', 'Deleeuw, N', 'Bron, D', 'Debusscher, L', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Bernier M', 'Massy M', 'Deleeuw N', 'Bron D', 'Debusscher L', 'Stryckmans P']","[""Service de Medecine et Laboratoire D'Investigation Clinique H.J.

Difficulties are frequently encountered however in reaching an acceptable degree of diagnostic concordance between different laboratories because of variations in the techniques used (in terms of methodologies, reagents and equipment) and diagnostic interpretation. The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) convened an expert panel to consider currently available diagnostic techniques with the aim of defining a minimum cytochemical and immunological diagnostic panel that could be used as core components for the classification of acute leukaemia. The proposed ICSH scheme, which attempts to balance the basic requirement for providing precise and informative diagnostic information without limiting its use to only those laboratories with sophisticated facilities, is based on three sequential levels of investigation; primary cytochemistry, intracellular phenotyping and membrane immunophenotyping. The minimum ICSH recommended cytochemistries comprise myeloperoxidase (MPO), chloroacetate esterase (ChlorE) and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), and standardised methods for these cytochemistries are detailed in this communication. For cases of acute leukaemia that remain unclassified by primary cytochemistry, subsequent immunological analyses for cytoplasmic CD3, CD22, MPO and nuclear TdT are recommended. The ICSH panel considers that the use of these minimum primary cytochemical and intracellular phenotyping procedures will lead to the consistent classification of most acute leukaemias, and that the third level of investigation (membrane immunophenotyping) should be used for the purposes of confirmation, diagnostic clarification of atypical leukaemias, and the subtyping of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). The ICSH panel also recognised that there are a number of additional technologies which can provide definitive diagnostic information, such as cytogenetics and DNA genotyping, but these were excluded from the minimum panel because of their restricted availability. While many specialised laboratories, particularly in the areas of diagnostic research, will continue to use individual investigatory protocols, it is considered that the inclusion of the ICSH scheme as core components would lead to greater consistency when comparing independent studies of acute leukaemia.","['Scott, C S', 'Den Ottolander, G J', 'Swirsky, D', 'Pangalis, G A', 'Vives Corrons, J L', 'De Pasquale, A', 'Van Hove, L', 'Bennett, J M', 'Namba, K', 'Flandrin, G']","['Scott CS', 'Den Ottolander GJ', 'Swirsky D', 'Pangalis GA', 'Vives Corrons JL', 'De Pasquale A', 'Van Hove L', 'Bennett JM', 'Namba K', 'Flandrin G', 'et al.']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds General Infirmary, England, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*classification/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509075296 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:1-12. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075296.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show 30% lower SOD activity in the sera from children with cancer compared with the sera from children with JCA. LSA levels 102% and 166% higher than in children with JCA were observed in the sera from children with blood and solid cancers, respectively. The relation LSA/SOD is about fivefold higher in children with cancers. A negative correlation (r = 0.720, P < 0.001) exists between LSA and SOD in sera from children with cancers. No such correlation was established in the group of children with JCA. We suppose that such differentiation disappears in the beginning of neoplastic process during prolonged therapy of autoimmune diseases.

Genetic linkage studies have also mapped a melanoma-susceptibility locus to chromosome 1p. The gene TAL1 is present on chromosome 1p32, and deletions within it are the commonest chromosomal abnormality in T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). A melanoma cell line harbouring a 1p32 deletion involving the TAL1 gene and the presence of TAL1 protein in developing mouse melanocytes led us to investigate whether TAL1 deletions and/or TAL1 protein expression occur in sporadic melanomas. DNA extracted from 32 fresh melanomas was amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction for the four common deletions of the TAL1 gene that occur in T-ALL. In addition, frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of these melanomas were stained with monoclonal antibodies that detect full-length and truncated TAL1 protein. The results of the study show that deletions of TAL1 do not occur in melanoma. Indeed, full and truncated TAL1 protein also could not be detected immunohistochemically in the paraffin-embedded and frozen sections of the melanomas.

An increase in this activity has been associated with cellular transformation, metastasis and differentiation.

All compounds with the minimum structure GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6Glc/Man beta-R were good substrates for GlcNAc-T V. The presence of structural elements other than the minimum trisaccharide structure affected GlcNAc-T V activity without being an absolute requirement for activity.

Depending upon the content of biantennary structure on AGP, up to four glycoforms of AGP are present in serum. These glycoforms can be easily estimated in body fluids by means of crossed affinity-immunoelectrophoresis (CAIE) with the lectin, Concanavalin A (Con A). Con A selectively binds biantennary structures; the more biantennary structures on AGP, the stronger the binding. In acute inflammation, a relative increase of AGP glycoforms with biantennary units is observed-a type I glycosylation change. In some chronic inflammatory states there is an relative decrease of AGP glycoforms with biantennary heteroglycans-a type II glycosylation change. Moreover, in certain other states such as pregnancy, estrogen administration or liver damage, type II glycosylation changes are also seen. A detailed analysis of the clinical applications of the assessment of AGP glycoforms in sera of patients with rheumatic diseases, AIDS and various types of cancers is presented. Accumulated data shows that AGP glycoforms may be very useful in the detection of intercurrent infections in the course of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or myeloblastic leukaemia, and in the detection of secondary infections in human immunodeficiency virus infected individuals. AGP glycoforms are also very useful in differentiation between various forms of trophoblastic disease and are helpful in monitoring the treatment of these patients. Finally, AGP glycoforms provide valuable information for differentiation between primary and secondary liver cancer.","['Mackiewicz, A', 'Mackiewicz, K']","['Mackiewicz A', 'Mackiewicz K']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, University School of Medical Sciences, Great Poland Cancer Center, Poznan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Orosomucoid)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood', 'Biomarkers/chemistry', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*blood', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/blood/chemistry', 'Orosomucoid/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Rheumatic Diseases/blood']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00731326 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 1995 Jun;12(3):241-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00731326.,43,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ratio of GnT-III activity per normalized transcript in CML-BC was considerably higher than in the other conditions, which provided the possibility that in CML-BC the transcript or the enzyme protein might be more stable, or that a post-translational modification of the enzyme might enhance its activity. Furthermore, a lectin blot analysis of patient specimens and a lectin fluorescence study of CML cell lines revealed that E4-PHA binding to surface glycoproteins correlated with GnT-III activity, indicating that more bisecting GlcNAc was added to these glycoproteins, catalysed by elevated GnT-III in CML-BC.","['Yoshimura, M', 'Ihara, Y', 'Taniguchi, N']","['Yoshimura M', 'Ihara Y', 'Taniguchi N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.144 (beta-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein', 'beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00731325 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 1995 Jun;12(3):234-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00731325.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptional activation of the 'germline' human C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 genes is triggered by TGF-beta 1 and is controlled by proximal positive and distal negative regulatory elements residing upstream of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 switch regions respectively. In this report we characterize the positive proximal regulatory elements and analyse their interaction with DNA binding proteins. Our data demonstrate that a 100 bp fragment that contains a cAMP responsive element (CRE)/activating transcription factor (ATF) motif, a putative Ets binding site and an element that is created by two previously described neighbouring direct repeats (DRE), can increase the basal level of transcription and confer TGF-beta 1 inducibility to a heterologous promoter in an orientation- and position-independent manner. Ubiquitously expressed DNA binding proteins interact specifically with the CRE/ATF, the Ets site and the DRE element. Additionally, nuclear proteins interact with sequences which are located downstream of this enhancer are not essential for transcription in the transient expression assays utilized; however, they contain motifs that have been previously implicated in regulating DNA recombination events. These motifs include a Chi motif and a Chi-like element previously found in the recombination hotspot region of the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene and close to chromosomal breakpoints in T-ALL lines. Our findings raise the possibility that the intervening region associated regulatory elements in addition to regulating the transcriptional activation of the Ig heavy chain genes could also facilitate the physical interaction of transcription and recombination controlling molecular mechanisms.","['Nilsson, L', 'Grant, P', 'Larsson, I', 'Pettersson, S', 'Sideras, P']","['Nilsson L', 'Grant P', 'Larsson I', 'Pettersson S', 'Sideras P']","['Department of Applied Cell and Molecular Biology, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Switch Region/genetics', 'Introns/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Recombination, Genetic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/7.8.1191 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1995 Aug;7(8):1191-204. doi: 10.1093/intimm/7.8.1191.,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nine published studies on this topic were analyzed, with a focus on the selection of subjects, assessment of exposure, and control of confounding. Consistency of a positive association and dose-response relationship are evident for assessment of past exposure: among the five recent studies, relative risk estimates vary from 1.5 to 2.7 for past exposure assessment, and a significant dose-response relation was found in three studies. These observations cannot be explained by misclassification of exposure or consistent selection bias, and a confounder effect could hardly explain such results. Even if there is no currently understood biological plausibility for such an association, its possible causal nature cannot be dismissed.

The rate of cell membrane transport and folylpolyglutamate synthetase substrate activity influence compound polyglutamation. A series of intact-cell assays has been used to determine how specific modifications of 2-desamino-2-methyl-N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (ICI 198583) affect compound polyglutamation. Those containing the 'classical' glutamate structure were usually, but not always, well polyglutamated intracellularly. Replacement of N10 propargyl with smaller aliphatic substituents, particularly when combined with replacement of the benzene ring with thiophene or thiazole heterocycles, was beneficial for antitumour activity through polyglutamate formation. Fluorination of the benzene, particularly if a F was adjacent to the 'bridge region' (3'F or 2',5'diF), also gave compounds with a high dependence on polyglutamation for activity. Those analogues with 2-CH2OH or NH2 substituents were poor substrates for the reduced-folate cell membrane carrier which can account for their reduced polyglutamation rate and hence growth-inhibitory activity. A large decrease or prevention of polyglutamation was achieved by the introduction of CH3, CH2CH3, Br or C1 on C7. The concomitant enhancement in TS inhibition by these modifications gave compounds active under continuous-exposure cell culture conditions. Some ICI 198583 analogues had the glutamate moiety replaced with unnatural amino acids or dipeptides. Only the L-gamma-L-glu analogue (a polyglutamate metabolite of ICI 198583) gave activity entirely attributable to polyglutamate formation.","['Jackman, A L', 'Kimbell, R', 'Brown, M', 'Brunton, L', 'Bisset, G M', 'Bavetsias, V', 'Marsham, P', 'Hughes, L R', 'Boyle, F T']","['Jackman AL', 'Kimbell R', 'Brown M', 'Brunton L', 'Bisset GM', 'Bavetsias V', 'Marsham P', 'Hughes LR', 'Boyle FT']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Glutamates/chemistry', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1995 Oct;10(7):573-89.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a series of quinazolines was tested for inhibitory activity towards TS (IC50 0.001-2 microM) and the growth of L1210 cells (IC50 0.005-10 microM), no direct correlation was observed. However, a very good correlation was apparent if a L1210 variant cell line (L1210: RD1694) was used. This line is deficient in its ability to form antifolate polyglutamates. A number of other intact cell methods have also been developed which estimate the contribution that intracellular polyglutamation makes to a compound's activity. These assays were validated using a series of quinazoline-based TS inhibitors with well-defined activity for TS, folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) and the reduced-folate cell membrane carrier (RFC). Short-exposure growth-inhibition assays or the measurement of TS activity in situ after various incubation times, followed by different lengths of time in drug-free medium, can indicate both the speed and extent of appearance of retentive forms (usually polyglutamates). Continuous-exposure growth-inhibition assays, in the presence of leucovorin (LV), are also useful, since only the growth-inhibitory potency of polyglutamated analogues is significantly decreased by LV. Highly polyglutamated compounds, e.g. ZD1694, are virtually inactive in the presence of a high concentration of LV. It is proposed that these methods, when considered together, provide a greater degree of information concerning the rate and extent of polyglutamation of a particular compound than isolated FPGS assays alone.","['Jackman, A L', 'Kimbell, R', 'Brown, M', 'Brunton, L', 'Boyle, F T']","['Jackman AL', 'Kimbell R', 'Brown M', 'Brunton L', 'Boyle FT']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1995 Oct;10(7):555-72.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the basic mutational processes involved during retroviral replication is important for comprehending the ability of retroviruses to escape immunosurveillance and antiviral drug treatment. Moreover, since retroviral vectors are important vehicles for somatic cell gene therapy, knowledge of the mechanism of retroviral variation is critical for anticipating untoward mutational events occurring during retrovirus-medicated gene transfer. The focus of this report is to examine the spectrum of genomic rearrangements arising during a single cycle of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) vector virus replication. An MoMLV vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene was constructed. MoMLV vector virus was produced in packaging lines, and target cells were infected. From a total of 224 mutant proviruses analyzed, 114 had gross rearrangements readily detectable by Southern blotting. The remaining proviruses were of parental size. PCR and DNA sequence analysis of 73 of the grossly rearranged mutant proviruses indicated they resulted from deletions, combined with insertions, duplications, and complex mutations that were a result of multiple genomic alterations in the same provirus. Complex hypermutations distinct from those previously described for spleen necrosis virus and human immunodeficiency virus were detected. There was a correlation between the mutation breakpoints and single-stranded regions in the predicted viral RNA secondary structure. The results also confirmed that the tk gene is inactivated at an average rate of about 8.8% per cycle of retroviral replication, which corresponds to a rate of mutation of 3%/kbp.","['Parthasarathi, S', 'Varela-Echavarria, A', 'Ron, Y', 'Preston, B D', 'Dougherty, J P']","['Parthasarathi S', 'Varela-Echavarria A', 'Ron Y', 'Preston BD', 'Dougherty JP']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway 08854-5635, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/genetics', 'Humans', 'L Cells', 'Mice', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.12.7991-8000.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Dec;69(12):7991-8000. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.12.7991-8000.1995.,,12,,"['5RO1 AI3483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA50777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC189744,,"['GENBANK/J02255', 'GENBANK/J02256', 'GENBANK/J02257']",,,,,,,,,,

The F-SFFV env gene has three characteristic structures compared with that of ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs): substitution by the polytropic MuLV env sequence, a 585-bp deletion, and a 1-bp insertion. All of these characteristic structures are essential for the leukemogenic potential of gp55 of polycythemia-inducing isolates of F-SFFV (F-SFFVp). The 1-bp insertion causes changes of six amino acids and truncation by 34 amino acids at the C terminus. In this study, we constructed 12 mutant F-SFFV genomes starting from the wild-type F-SFFVp and examined the effect of the C-terminal truncation and the six altered amino acids on the pathogenic activity of gp55. The results indicated that at least 18 to 24 amino acids must be deleted from the C terminus for the env product to be pathogenically active. We also found that the six altered amino acids contributed significantly to the pathogenic activity of gp55.

However, it is uncertain which RNA sequences and structures contribute to Rex recognition. A portion of the viral genome that spanned the XBE was partially randomized, and functional Rex-binding variants were selected. Alignment of selected Rex-binding sequences revealed positions that were functionally conserved between different molecules. A model is presented in which a subset of the selected residues are in direct contact with Rex. Positions that covaried with one another were also found. These covariations support a secondary-structural model in which a central paired stem is symmetrically flanked by two bulge loops. On the basis of this model, site-directed mutations of the XBE were constructed and each half molecule was found to bind independently to Rex. The functional residues and secondary structures in the XBE half molecules bear a remarkable resemblance to the transactivation response region element of HIV-1. Since the transactivation response region element is known to interact specifically with arginine residues in the Tat protein, these results suggest that the XBE binds to the arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of Rex in a similar manner.

Transient transfection experiments revealed that both the viral enhancer region in the U3 region of the long terminal repeat as well as a repressor element coincident with the primer binding site of Moloney leukemia viruses are limiting for expression in hematopoietic cells in a differentiation-dependent manner. Within the group of Moloney leukemia virus-related viruses, only the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus showed high enhancer activity in myeloid (including erythroid) cells. In contrast, enhancer regions related to the Friend mink cell focus-forming viruses mediate much higher gene expression levels in both multipotent and lineage-committed myeloid cells. In addition, transcriptional repression related to sequences in the primer binding site of Moloney leukemia virus-derived vectors is also found in early hematopoietic cells and can be overcome by using the corresponding sequences of the murine embryonic stem cell virus. On the basis of these results, two types of novel retroviral hybrid vectors were developed; they combine the U3 regions of either the Friend mink cell focus-forming virus family or the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus with the primer binding site of the murine embryonic stem cell virus.

In primary neutrophils from patients with CML, the major novel tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 linker protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene product. Anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates from CML cells, but not normal cells, were found to contain p210BCR/ABL and c-ABL. Several other phosphoproteins were also detected in anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates, one of which has been identified as paxillin, a 68-kDa focal adhesion protein which we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by p210BCR/ABL. Using GST-CRKL fusion proteins, the SH3 domains of CRKL were found to bind c-ABL and p210BCR/ABL, while the SH2 domain of CRKL bound to paxillin, suggesting that CRKL could physically link p210BCR/ABL to paxillin. Paxillin contains three tyrosines in Tyr-X-X-Pro (Y-X-X-P) motifs consistent with amino acid sequences predicted to be optimal for binding to the CRKL-SH2 domain (at positions Tyr-31, Tyr-118, and Tyr-181). Each of these tyrosine residues was mutated to a phenylalanine residue, and in vitro binding assays indicated that paxillin tyrosines at positions 31 and 118, but not 181, are likely to be involved in CRKL-SH2 binding. These results suggest that the p210BCR/ABL oncogene may be physically linked to the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin in hematopoietic cells by CRKL.

It was recently suggested that L-asparaginase derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi alters the coagulation system less severely than does Escherichia coli asparaginase. In a series of 11 adult patients with ALL, we investigated some parameters of the coagulation system during treatment with Erwinia asparaginase. The doses employed were rather high; all patients below the age of 60 years received 15,000 U/m2 daily over 14 days. In accordance with what is known from treatment with E. coli asparaginase, we observed significant lowering of antithrombin as well as of fibrinogen. However, as to fibrinogen indeed a significant decrease had occurred prior to the institution of Erwinia asparaginase treatment. The most striking observation in the present study was that the levels of prothrombin complex, reflecting the function of K-vitamin dependent coagulation factors II, VII and X, remained within normal ranges during treatment. This indicates that these coagulation factors were not affected by Erwinia asparaginase, an observation at variance with several reports where E. coli asparaginase was investigated. This latter observation was the only finding which could lend support to the view that Erwinia asparaginase affects the coagulation system less than E. coli asparaginase.

In the absence of infection, we observed that both are components, not only of nuclear bodies, but also of interchromatin granule-associated zones, which suggests a potential role for PML and Sp100 in splicing events. Prolonged HSV-1 infection induced dramatic changes in nuclear organization which consisted of the morphological disappearance of some nuclear structures (nuclear bodies, interchromatin granule-associated zones, coiled bodies) and of the development of a centrally located electron-translucent viral region which pushed the cellular clusters of interchromatin granules to the nuclear border. Concomitantly, dense bodies, concentric arrays of reduplicated inner nuclear membrane, and translucent patches containing a few viral capsids occurred at the nuclear border. PML and Sp100 were exclusively detected over the finely granular material of the viral translucent patches which also contains small amounts of p80-coilin and U1 and U2 snRNAs. An antiserum raised against capsid proteins intensely labeled the viral translucent patches at the level of their finely granular material and enclosed viral capsids. Our data, therefore, suggest that these viral structures, in addition to being the site of accumulation of viral capsid proteins and, possibly, a capsidworks, are also a site of sequestration of cell factors including PML and Sp100. Viral capsid proteins could interfere with and inactivate PML and Sp100 and be implicated in the shutoff of host cell metabolism induced by HSV-1 infection.","['Puvion-Dutilleul, F', 'Venturini, L', 'Guillemin, M C', 'de The, H', 'Puvion, E']","['Puvion-Dutilleul F', 'Venturini L', 'Guillemin MC', 'de The H', 'Puvion E']","[""Laboratoire, Organisation fonctionnelle du Noyau de l'UPR 9044 CNRS, Villejuif, Franc.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '136882-81-0 (p80-coilin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Autoantigens/*analysis', 'Capsid/analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/ultrastructure/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/*chemistry/ultrastructure', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Envelope/chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(85)71396-1 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1995.1396 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1995 Dec;221(2):448-61. doi: 10.1006/excr.1995.1396.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such foci could be detected in cells of many mammalian species. These nuclear foci were not associated with nuclear membrane, nucleoli, or mitotic chromosomes. In isolated rat liver nuclei, HeLa cells, and normal human and rat lymph nodes, staining of HIS55 colocalized with that of 5E10. 5E10 recognizes PML nuclear domains, multimolecular complexes of unknown function containing the product of PML gene and at least two other components. HIS55 foci were expressed widely in many tissues but the expression level varied in a cell type-specific manner, with the number of HIS55 nuclear foci ranging from 0 (as in neurons) to over 100 (as in megakaryocytes) and the size ranging from fine (as in cortical thymocytes) to very large (as in urethra epithelium). HIS55 ag expression level also varied among cells of the same lineage, as observed in embryonic development of rat and in the hemopoietic system of adult rat. The expression level of HIS55 foci roughly correlated with the overall rate of protein synthesis of cells, supporting a role of PML domains as transcription regulatory units.

We now show that most breakpoints on chromosome 8 fall within a region between two alternative 5' MTG8 exons.

A complementarity-determining region-grafted, humanized version (HuM195) has demonstrated similar targeting of leukemia cells without immunogenicity. We have studied two applications of therapy with 131I-M195. First, to intensify therapy prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we combined 131I-M195 with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Fifteen patients received first BMT for relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or accelerated or blastic chronic myelogenous leukemia; four received second BMT for relapsed chronic or accelerated chronic myelogenous leukemia. Doses of 131I-M195 ranged from 120 to 230 mCi/m2. Few toxicities could be attributed to 131I-M195 therapy, and all patients engrafted. Eighteen patients achieved complete remission. Among those patients receiving first BMT, three have remained in unmaintained remission for 18+ to 29+ months. Six patients relapsed, including one with isolated central nervous system disease 32 months after BMT. Ten patients died in complete remission of transplant-related complications. Second, we studied whether 131I-M195 could reduce minimal residual disease and prolong remission and survival durations safely in patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia after they attained remission with all-trans-retinoic acid. Seven patients were treated with either 50 or 70 mCi/m2 131I-M195. Toxicity was limited to myelosuppression. As a measure of minimal residual disease, we monitored PML/RAR-alpha mRNA by reverse transcription PCR. Six patients had positive reverse transcription PCR assays prior to receiving 131I-M195; two converted transiently to negative. Median disease-free survival and overall survival of the seven patients were 8 (range, 3-14.5) months and 28 (range, 5.5-43+) months, respectively. This regimen compares favorably with others for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia. In an effort to avoid nonspecific cytotoxicity associated with 131I in future trials for minimal residual disease, we have conjugated short-range, alpha particle-emitting radioisotopes to HuM195 using a bifunctional chelate, 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-cyclohexyldiethyl-enetriaminep entaacetic acid, with high efficiency and specific activities. 212Bi-HuM195 has demonstrated dose- and specific activity-dependent killing of HL60 cells in vitro.

Conversely, acute leukemias that express only myeloid antigens are also considered to be acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), even in the absence of MPO. These MPO-negative AMLs, designated AML-M0 in the FAB classification, currently require either immunophenotypic or electron microscopic studies for identification. To examine the association of MPO and myeloid antigen expression in AML, particularly at the early stages of myeloid cell differentiation, we have used in situ hybridization (ISH) to evaluate MPO gene expression in myeloid leukemia cell lines and a variety of well-characterized acute leukemias, including six cases of AML-M0. Strong positivity for MPO mRNA was detected in the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 and in 22 of 27 AMLs (three AML-M0, four AML-M1, eight AML-M2, five AML-M4, two AML-M5a). No MPO gene expression was detected in three AML-M0, one AML-M5a, one AML-M7, 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the lymphoid cell lines Molt-4 and Namalwa, or in the early myeloid cell lines KG-1 and KG-1a. Ultrastructural studies for MPO activity were performed on four AML-M0; one leukemia showed both gene expression and cytochemical activity, whereas two others contained neither MPO transcripts nor enzyme. Weak MPO gene expression was evident in one AML-M0 that was negative for enzymatic activity by electron microscopy. These studies show MPO gene expression can be detected by ISH in about half of AML-M0, supporting their presumed myelocytic derivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Traweek, S T', 'Liu, J', 'Braziel, R M', 'Johnson, R M', 'Byrnes, R K']","['Traweek ST', 'Liu J', 'Braziel RM', 'Johnson RM', 'Byrnes RK']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Peroxidase/analysis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199509000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1995 Sep;4(3):212-9. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199509000-00009.,,3,,['CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such infusions are associated with a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and marrow aplasia. BMT using selective depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes from donor cells reduces the incidence of GVHD without an increase in leukemia relapse. We hypothesized that infusion of CD8-depleted donor peripheral blood lymphocytes could also reinduce complete remissions with a lesser potential to produce symptomatic GVHD in patients with CML who relapsed after allogeneic BMT. Ten patients with Ph(+) CML who relapsed a median of 353 days after BMT (range, 82 to 1,096 days) received donor lymphocyte infusions depleted of CD8+ cells. Nine patients received a single infusion and 1 received two infusions. Four patients were treated while in chronic phase with clonal evolution, 2 during accelerated phase, 3 during blast crisis, and 1 in a cytogenetic relapse. A mean of 0.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg were infused, containing 0.6 +/- 0.4 x 10(6) CD3+CD8+ cells/kg. Six patients achieved hematologic and cytogenetic remission at 4, 8, 11, 15, 39, and 54 weeks after lymphocyte infusion. Two patients developed > or = grade II acute GVHD, and 1 patient developed mild chronic GVHD. We conclude that donor lymphocyte infusions depleted of CD8+ cells can induce remissions with a low rate of severe acute GVHD in patients with CML who relapse after allogeneic BMT, supporting the hypothesis that CD8+ lymphocytes are important effectors of GVHD, but may not be essential for the graft-versus-leukemia effect against this disease.

After treatment with anti-B4-bR, the Namalwa/mdr-1 population expressed lower levels of P-glycoprotein, and this decrease may account for the synergistic action of the drug combinations. These results suggest that anti-B4-bR could be used to good effect in combination with current treatment regimens and further hint at a promising role for this immunotoxin in treatment of disease at the minimal residual disease stage, where cells may be resistant to chemotherapy.","[""O'Connor, R"", 'Liu, C', 'Ferris, C A', 'Guild, B C', 'Teicher, B A', 'Corvi, C', 'Liu, Y', 'Arceci, R J', 'Goldmacher, V S', 'Lambert, J M', 'Blattler, W A']","[""O'Connor R"", 'Liu C', 'Ferris CA', 'Guild BC', 'Teicher BA', 'Corvi C', 'Liu Y', 'Arceci RJ', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Lambert JM', 'Blattler WA']","['ImmunoGen, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63489-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 1;86(11):4286-94.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With modern therapy, response rates are 70% to 80%, but cure rates only average 25% to 30%. Improved in vivo models are needed to investigate the biology of adult ALL and to test new treatment concepts. Fresh leukemia samples from children with ALL have been successfully transplanted into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), but no experience exists for adult ALL. We treated SCID mice with 2 mg cyclophosphamide 24 hours before intravenously injecting 20 x 10(6) viable leukemia cells obtained from 13 patients with newly diagnosed adult ALL within five defined phenotype/karyotype subcategories. Ten (76%) of 13 injected leukemia specimens representing all five categories engrafted. The median survival duration of mice was 20 weeks from the time of leukemia cell injection. The rate of engraftment by ALL subset was as follows: two of two T-cell, two of three t(11q23), two of two hyperdiploid, two of three t(9;22), and two of three diploid ALL. The pattern of organ involvement by leukemia in the mice was similar to that of the human disease. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry documented the stability of each leukemic phenotype after passage through SCID mice. Cells transplanted from the spleen and bone marrow of mice engrafted with ALL into recipient mice resulted in consistent engraftment. The survival duration in passage groups was similar to that in groups injected with primary cells. The high frequency of engraftment, availability of frozen original specimens, and successful passages in SCID mice provide an in vivo model of adult ALL suitable for further studies of the disease biology and for design of drug studies for the different subtypes of previously untreated adult ALL.","['Jeha, S', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Huh, Y', 'Pisa, P', 'Ordonez, N', 'Beran, M']","['Jeha S', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Huh Y', 'Pisa P', 'Ordonez N', 'Beran M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63488-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 1;86(11):4278-85.,,11,,"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56887-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In tritiated thymidine incorporation assays, stem cell factor plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulated thymidine incorporation in normal CD34+ cells was reduced to 72% of control values in the presence of MIP-1 alpha, whereas incorporation by CML CD34+ cells exposed to the same factors was not altered. In clonogenic assays, the presence of MIP-1 alpha gave a level of colony formation that was 71% of control values for normal progenitor cells, whereas for CML CD34+ cells colony formation was enhanced by 25%. These results suggest that, in vitro, CML progenitor cells are relatively refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of MIP-1 alpha. Using flow cytometry, the specific binding of a biotinylated human MIP-1 alpha/avidin fluorescein (FITC) conjugate to normal and CML mononuclear and CD34+ cell populations was quantified. The data indicate that (for both normal and CML CD34+ cells) there was a single population of cells that express cell surface receptors for MIP-1 alpha and this receptor expression was independent of cell cycle status.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of FL on the proliferation and differentiation of normal and leukemic myeloid progenitor cells. We demonstrate that FL is a potent stimulator of the in vitro growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), or G-CSF-dependent granulocyte-macrophage committed precursors from Lin- CD34+ bone marrow cells of normal donors. By contrast, FL does not affect the growth of erythroid-committed progenitors even in the presence of erythropoietin. The effect of FL on the proliferation and on the in vitro growth of clonogenic leukemic precursor cells was studied in 54 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. Fresh leukemia blasts from 36 of 45 patients with AML significantly responded to FL without any relation to the French-American-British (FAB) subtype. FL stimulated the proliferation of leukemic blasts in a dose-dependent fashion. Synergistic activities were seen when FL was combined with G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, or stem cell factor (SCF). FL as a single factor induced or increased significantly colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells from 21 of 24 patients with AML. In the presence of suboptimal and optimal concentrations of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL3, SCF, or a combination of all factors, FL strongly enhanced the number of leukemic colonies (up to 18-fold). We also evaluated the induction of tyrosine phosphorylated protein on FL stimulation in fresh AML cells. We demonstrate that, on FL stimulation, a band of phosphorylated protein(s) of about 90 kD can be detected in FL-responsive, but not in FL-unresponsive cases. This study suggests that FL may be an important factor for the growth of myeloid leukemia cells, either as a direct stimulus or as a synergistic factor with other cytokines.","['Piacibello, W', 'Fubini, L', 'Sanavio, F', 'Brizzi, M F', 'Severino, A', 'Garetto, L', 'Stacchini, A', 'Pegoraro, L', 'Aglietta, M']","['Piacibello W', 'Fubini L', 'Sanavio F', 'Brizzi MF', 'Severino A', 'Garetto L', 'Stacchini A', 'Pegoraro L', 'Aglietta M']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Medical School of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63466-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Dec 1;86(11):4105-14.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an aggressive leukemia with a median survival time of 9 months; no chemotherapy regimen appears successful in inducing long-term disease-free survival. The scientific basis of the present study is that ATL cells express high-affinity interleukin-2 receptors identified by the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, whereas normal resting cells do not. To exploit this difference, we administered anti-Tac armed with Yttrium-90 (90Y) to 18 patients with ATL initially (first 9 patients) in a phase I dose-escalation trial and subsequently (second group of 9 patients) in a phase II trial involving a uniform 10-mCi dose of 90Y-labeled anti-Tac. Patients undergoing a remission were permitted to receive up to eight additional doses. At the 5- to 15-mCi doses used, 9 of 16 evaluable patients responded to 90Y anti-Tac with a partial (7 patients) or complete (2 patients) remission. The responses observed represent improved efficacy in terms of length of remission when compared with previous results with unmodified anti-Tac. Clinically meaningful (> or = grade 3) toxicity was largely limited to the hematopoietic system.

Identification was done by FAB-MS, 1H NMR, and UV spectroscopy. The reaction of p-BQ with dC and dA at pH 4.5 produced the exocyclic compounds 3-hydroxy-1,N4-benzetheno-2'-deoxycytidine (p-BQ-dC), and 9-hydroxy-1,N6-benzetheno-2'-deoxyadenosine (p-BQ-dA), respectively, in a large scale and high yield.

The exocyclic hydroxyl on the base has been successfully protected by acylation after protecting the 5'- and the 3'-hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety with a 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl group and a cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite group, respectively. For the first time, to our knowledge, the fully protected phosphoramidites of p-BQ-dC and p-BQ-dA were prepared and incorporated site-specifically into a series of oligonucleotides. The coupling efficiency was very high (> 98%). However, deprotection of the DNA oligomers with ammonia produced only 50% of the desired oligomers containing the adduct. In contrast, when 10% of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in methanol at room temperature was used, only the desired oligomers were detected by HPLC. Thus, by deprotecting the oligomers with methoxide ions (DBU/methanol) and avoiding the use of ammonia, a high yield of modified DNA was obtained. After purification of these oligomers by HPLC, they were hydrolyzed enzymatically and analyzed by HPLC, which confirmed the base composition and the incorporation of the adducts. The mass spectroscopic analysis of the DNA oligomers was confirmed by electrospray MS. These oligomers are now under investigation for their biochemical properties.","['Chenna, A', 'Singer, B']","['Chenna A', 'Singer B']","['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"[""0 (3-hydroxy-1,N(4)-benzetheno-2'-deoxycytidine)"", ""0 (9-hydroxy-1,N(6)-benzetheno-2'-deoxyadenosine)"", '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Benzimidazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/*chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Adducts/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/*metabolism']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx00048a007 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 1995 Sep;8(6):865-74. doi: 10.1021/tx00048a007.,,6,,['CA47723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cytokines significantly stimulated mPL-I secretion by cells from Day 9, but not Day 7, of pregnancy. An antibody to LIF completely blocked the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of LIF on mPL-I and mPL-II secretion, respectively. LIF and OM decreased the abundance of mPL-II mRNA in placental cells. Double immunocytochemistry for mPL-I and mPL-II indicated that LIF, OM, and IL-11 significantly increased the number of giant cells containing only mPL-I or both mPL-I and mPL-II but decreased the number of giant cells containing only mPL-II. IL-6, which also uses gp130 as a signal transducer, inhibits mPL-II secretion only after midpregnancy; however, addition of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) together with IL-6 resulted in a significant inhibition of mPL-II secretion before midpregnancy.

Case 2, a 1-year-old neutered female cat, which had close contact with Case 1, also developed erythroleukemia (M6Er). In both cases, marked proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells with disproportionally large numbers of immature forms was observed in the bone marrow. In Case 1, neoplastic proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow was also noted at the terminal stage. Combination chemotherapy with daunomycin was partially effective for treatment of these erythroid neoplasias, but did not induce complete remission. Southern blot analysis using exogenous FeLV-specific probes indicated the clonal origin of these hematopoietic tumor cells. Furthermore, the erythroid and myeloid tumor cells in Case 1 were shown to be derived from independent transformed clones. A variant FeLV was shown to be integrated into the tumor cells in Case 1, while a full-length FeLV was found in both cases. Because these erythroid neoplastic diseases occurred in two unrelated cats kept in the same household and these diseases are rare, they may both have been associated with the same FeLV strain.","['Shimada, T', 'Matsumoto, Y', 'Okuda, M', 'Momoi, Y', 'Bonkobara, M', 'Watari, T', 'Goitsuka, R', 'Ono, K', 'Goto, N', 'Tsujimoto, H']","['Shimada T', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Okuda M', 'Momoi Y', 'Bonkobara M', 'Watari T', 'Goitsuka R', 'Ono K', 'Goto N', 'Tsujimoto H', 'et al.']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Pathobiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious/veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Leukemia, Feline/blood/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Orchiectomy', 'Ovariectomy']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.57.199 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 1995 Apr;57(2):199-204. doi: 10.1292/jvms.57.199.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was considered as differential diagnosis. Plasma levels of soluble adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin regulating leukocyte transendothelial migration were in the normal range. Systemic glucocorticoids were avoided because of the high risk of infection during prolonged bone marrow aplasia. The lesions were treated with topical steroids and resolved without scarring within 1-5 weeks. AFND has been reported in association with acute leukemia at normal or elevated white blood cell counts.

Initially, the disease was staged as Rai II and the patient suffered from secondary immunoglobulin deficiency. Nevertheless, no treatment was necessary at that time. Because of disease progression a single course of chemotherapy was given in 1984. During the following year there was a constant decline of the WBC, accompanied by normalization of the immunoglobulins; both have remained stable ever since that time. However, there was still residual bone marrow infiltration, indicating persisting CLL. In 1993 cervical lymphadenopathy occurred with acute onset. A diagnostic lymphadenectomy revealed Hodgkin's disease of the nodular-sclerosing subtype. The patient was staged as II-III according to the Ann Arbor Classification and underwent radiation therapy. Cytogenetic examination of the bone marrow revealed a normal karyotype with an inversion of chromosome 9.

Preincubation of human MIP-1 alpha, MIP-2 alpha, interleukin (IL)-8, platelet factor (PF) 4, monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF), and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in an acetonitrile (ACN) solution significantly enhanced the specific activity of these chemokines for in vitro suppression of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells stimulated to proliferate with a colony stimulating factor plus steel factor (SLF). Combinations of any two of these ACN-treated chemokines synergized to suppress colony formation of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM at chemokine concentrations below that at which combinations of non-ACN treated chemokines are active. Cord blood progenitors, as previously reported, were in a slow or noncycling state and nonresponsive to inhibition by chemokines. However, after suspension culture with GM-CSF, IL-3, and SLF, they were placed into rapid cell cycle and were responsive to inhibition by ACN-treated chemokines. Low doses of these ACN-pretreated chemokines were active in vivo in suppressing absolute numbers and cycling status of femoral marrow CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM in C3H/HeJ mice. Other chemokines, alone and in combination, including MIP-1 beta, MIP-2 beta, GRO-alpha NAP-2, and RANTES, were inactive in vitro and in vivo whether or not they were pretreated with ACN. While heterogeneity in responsiveness of CFU-GM from different patients with leukemia to suppression by ACN-treated chemokines was apparent, if the patients had CFU-GM responsive to one of the active chemokines these cells were responsive to the other active chemokines; if patient CFU-GM were not responsive to one of the chemokines, they were not responsive to the other active chemokines. M07e colony-forming cells were responsive to the growth-inhibiting effects of the active ACN-treated chemokines, alone and in combination, but these effects were rapidly reversible and sustained only by multiple daily additions of chemokines. These results should be of value in considering these chemokines for potential clinical use and for assessment of their mechanisms of action, alone and in combination.","['Broxmeyer, H E', 'Cooper, S', 'Hague, N', 'Benninger, L', 'Sarris, A', 'Cornetta, K', 'Vadhan-Raj, S', 'Hendrie, P', 'Mantel, C']","['Broxmeyer HE', 'Cooper S', 'Hague N', 'Benninger L', 'Sarris A', 'Cornetta K', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Hendrie P', 'Mantel C']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CXCL10', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines/*pharmacology', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Monokines', 'Platelet Factor 4/pharmacology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01744373 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1995 Nov;71(5):235-46. doi: 10.1007/BF01744373.,,5,,"['IT32 DK07519/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL46549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received the same induction and early consolidation therapy with daunorubicin (DNR), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and etoposide (DAV). High-dose Ara-C/DNR therapy included Ara-C at 3 g/m2, in 12 doses (HD-Ara-C/DNR I) and eight doses (HD-Ara-C/DNR II), followed by DNR 30 mg/m2 for 3 days. A complete remission (CR) was achieved in 104 (70%) patients; 61 complete responders received at least one cycle with HD-Ara-C/DNR. If those patients who were transplanted in first CR (n = 26), were not considered, the median relapse-free-survival (MRFS) of the remaining 78 patients was 15 months, with a probability of relapse-free survival (RFS) at 116 months of 30% (95% CI, 20-40%) after a median follow-up of 95 months. The MRFS of the HD-Ara-C/DNR consolidated patients was 25 months, with a probability of RFS at 116 months of 37% (95% CI, 24-50%). If all patients who were transplanted (n = 44) were not considered, the median survival time (MST) was 18 months with a probability of being alive at 118 months of 24% (95% CI, 16-33%). MST of the HD-Ara-C/DNR consolidated patients was 58 months with a survival probability of 46% (95% CI, 31-60%) at 118 months. Prognostic factor analysis did not reveal any significant influence of age, sex, FAB subtype, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, thrombocyte count, LDH, or response to the first induction course on RFS of the HD-Ara-C/DNR consolidated patients. In summary, HD-Ara-C/DNR consolidation can improve the long-term outcome of a subgroup of de novo AML patients.

Furthermore, the activity of the cytosolic acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT), which was calculated from the rate of 14C-oleate incorporation into the cellular cholesteryl esters, increased with the degree of LDL hydrolysis. The incubation of macrophages with native HDL led to decreased labeling of cellular cholesteryl esters. However, after PLA2-treatment of HDL the esterification rate increased with the degree of hydrolysis analogous to PLA2-modified LDL.

The report shows both successes and failures, confirms some earlier published results and presents some new findings worth further analysis. Survival has increased for female breast cancer, malignant melanoma, cancers of the testis and thyroid gland, acute leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease. No improvements are found for multiple myeloma or cancers of the liver, gall bladder, and pancreas. Small increases are shown for colorectal cancer and cancers of the stomach, oesophagus, and kidney. Increases in postoperative survival are shown for sites dominated by histologically benign tumors, i.e., intracranial neurinoma, meningioma, and cancers of the endocrine glands such as parathyroid tumors. From 1970-1972 to 1980-1982 the 10-year relative survival rate (RSR) increased from 30% to 38% for males and from 44% to 51% for females. Hence, cancer survival for all cases combined has approached the survival of the general population somewhat. Most of the increases took place in the 1970's. Changes in the distribution of incidence towards cancer sites with better prognoses account for some 10-20% of the observed increases in RSR, whereas the aging of the cancer population reduces the upward trend in RSR for all cases combined by some 1-2%. Cancer patients have poorer survival than the population long after 5 years of follow-up. They reach the survival of the population after about 8-12 years for colorectal cancer, 10 years for cervical cancer, 7-10 years for malignant melanoma, 13-18 years for kidney cancer, and more than 19 years for female breast and prostate cancer. For patients diagnosed in 1970-1972 this occurred 16 years after diagnosis at 29% for males and 43% for females when all cancer cases were combined. The extended time until 'statistical cure' for most cancer forms clearly indicates the need to augment the commonly used 5-year RSR with other outcome measures. If cancers on average are discovered earlier today, the 5-year RSR gives an exaggerated impression of the improvement over time. In this case the change in the 10-year RSR is a less biased criterion.","['Stenbeck, M', 'Rosen, M', 'Holm, L E']","['Stenbeck M', 'Rosen M', 'Holm LE']","['Centre for Epidemiology, National Board of Health and Welfare, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02841869509127200 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 1995;34(7):881-91. doi: 10.3109/02841869509127200.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that activation of proliferation leads to an increase in the production of nuclear diacylglycerol (DAG). Here we demonstrate that differentiation leads to a decrease in the levels of nuclear DAG and the activity of the nuclear-associated phosphoinositidase C (PIC). The change in activity appears to be due to a decrease in the mass levels of the beta 1 isoform, as demonstrated by the use of isoform-specific antibodies. Moreover, the changes correlate with the cessation of proliferation and an increase in the number of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle, rather than with the number of cells which have differentiated. Indeed, although treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibits the differentiation programme as assessed by haemoglobin staining, it does not inhibit the number of cells blocking in G1 of the cell cycle or the changes in nuclear DAG or PIC activity.

In these cells, thrombin and U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F2 alpha), a thromboxane A2 analogue, increased intracellular Ca2+ in a rapid and concentration-dependent manner. The peak transient observed with both thrombin and U46619 was preserved upon stimulation in the absence of extracellular calcium and blunted with phorbol myristate acetate, suggestive of activation of phospholipase C. Short-term treatment with leupeptin abolished the calcium response to thrombin, but did not alter that to U46619. Both pertussis toxin (PT) and DMSO pretreatment inhibited thrombin- but not U46619-stimulated intracellular calcium elevation, indicating that these agonists signal through different G-proteins. Western blot analysis of crude membranes from K562 cells revealed the presence of G12 alpha and G13 alpha; the other known PT-substrates, Gi1 alpha and G0 alpha, were not detected. Consistent with this observation, ADP-ribosylation experiments revealed the presence of two PT substrates which co-migrated with human erythrocyte G12 alpha and G13 alpha. An antibody raised against Gq/11 alpha, a subfamily of G-protein alpha subunits unmodified by PT, specifically recognized 42 kDa protein(s) in K562 cells. PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed K562 RNA followed by DNA sequencing showed that these cells express messages for both Gq alpha and G11 alpha. Treatment of K562 cells with DMSO reduced the levels of thrombin receptor mRNA, without simultaneous changes in the expression of G12 alpha and G13 alpha. We have thus identified Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists and related G-proteins in K562 cells, together with changes induced by DMSO in this signalling pathway.","['Thomas, C P', 'Dunn, M J', 'Mattera, R']","['Thomas CP', 'Dunn MJ', 'Mattera R']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)', '76898-47-0 (15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'DNA Probes', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lanthanum/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nickel/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Thromboxane A2/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3120151 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Nov 15;312 ( Pt 1):151-8. doi: 10.1042/bj3120151.,,,,"['GM 46552/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-22563/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1136238,,"['GENBANK/L40629', 'GENBANK/L40630']",,,,,,,,,,

Although P13-kinase is an acknowledged regulator of intracellular trafficking and secretion, wortmannin has proved to be a difficult drug to use in assessing the role of P13-kinase because it inhibits another important enzyme, myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK; IC50 = 200 nM). In the present study we synthesized a unique derivative of wortmannin, O-acetyl-delta 16-wortmannin-17-ol (KT7692), that has an inhibitory potency against PI3-kinase one-hundredth that of wortmannin, but retains a similar potency to wortmannin against MLCK. Histamine secretion was influenced 100-fold more by wortmannin than by KT7692.2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), a structurally different PI3-kinase inhibitor from wortmannin, inhibited PI3-kinase with an IC50 of 2 microM but had little effect on MLCK activity in this concentration range. LY294002 also inhibited histamine secretion in RBL-2H3 cells with an IC50 of 5 microM. These results provide further evidence that PI3-kinase is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for histamine secretion after stimulation of Fc epsilon RI. Furthermore KT7692 in combination with wortmannin and LY294002 would be a powerful tool for clarifying the involvement of PI3-kinase as distinct from that of MLCK in signal transduction systems of various cellular responses.","['Yano, H', 'Agatsuma, T', 'Nakanishi, S', 'Saitoh, Y', 'Fukui, Y', 'Nonomura, Y', 'Matsuda, Y']","['Yano H', 'Agatsuma T', 'Nakanishi S', 'Saitoh Y', 'Fukui Y', 'Nonomura Y', 'Matsuda Y']","['Tokyo Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.11.18 (Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aorta/drug effects/enzymology', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histamine Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Myosin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3120145 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Nov 15;312 ( Pt 1):145-50. doi: 10.1042/bj3120145.,,,,,PMC1136237,,,,,,,,,,,,

This compound exerts a delayed cytotoxicity due to inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) synthesis. Long-term exposure of U937 human monoblastoid cells to ddC resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in mDNA content and Rhodamine 123 fluorescence. However, after 2 months on 0.1 microM ddC, a drug-resistant cell line (U937-R) with 66% of the normal amount of mDNA was isolated. ddC transport in U937 and U937-R cell lines was similar. In contrast, U937-R accumulated ddC phosphorylated derivatives at a much lower rate and to a reduced concentration into acid-soluble material. The rate of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP) formation in U937-R cells was almost one-third of that measured in normal cells, although the rate of ddCTP catabolism was similar in both cell lines. Dideoxyliponucleotide (ddCDP-choline and ddCDP-ethanolamine) formation was also much slower (between one-half and one-third as fast) in U937-R than in control cells, although catabolism occurred at similar rates. ddC was phosphorylated by a cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase in both cell lines. This enzyme showed Km values for ddC of 80 +/- 7 and 140 +/- 9 microM in U937 and U937-R cells respectively. Furthermore, Vmax was 12 +/- 1.1 and 7.8 +/- 0.5 pmol/min per mg of protein in U937 and U937-R. Thus resistance to ddC toxicity may be due to cells' decreased ability to accumulate intracellular ddC anabolites, which may depend on cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase.","['Magnani, M', 'Brandi, G', 'Casabianca, A', 'Fraternale, A', 'Schiavano, G F', 'Rossi, L', 'Chiarantini, L']","['Magnani M', 'Brandi G', 'Casabianca A', 'Fraternale A', 'Schiavano GF', 'Rossi L', 'Chiarantini L']","['Istituto di Chimica Biologica G.

Mutant Rev proteins, displaying a transdominant phenotype (TDRev), were shown to inhibit Rev function. To investigate the underlying mechanism of this inhibition, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aequorea victoria was fused to Rev and TDRev, which allowed the study of their trafficking and interactions in living human cells. Both Rev-GFP and TDRev-GFP were shown to retain appropriate nucleolar localization and function. Upon actinomycin D treatment, Rev-GFP was transported to the cytoplasm within 1.5 hr, while TDRev, although partially dissociated from the nucleolus, was retained in the nucleus. Coexpression of Rev-GFP and TDRev in the same cell demonstrated that TDRev inhibited the transport of Rev-GFP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This inhibition was specific for Rev, since the export of the functionally analogous Rex protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I was not inhibited by TDRev. These results indicate that Rev and TDRev form heteromultimers in the nucleolus and that this interaction prevents Rev's export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In addition to providing a model for the function of TDRev, these results also demonstrate the successful application of protein fusions to GFP to study localization and trafficking of proteins in living mammalian cells.","['Stauber, R', 'Gaitanaris, G A', 'Pavlakis, G N']","['Stauber R', 'Gaitanaris GA', 'Pavlakis GN']","['Human Retrovirus Section, NCI-FCRDC, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV Core Protein p24/biosynthesis', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1995/11/10 00:00,1995/11/10 00:01,['1995/11/10 00:00'],"['1995/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682285700165 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.0016 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Nov 10;213(2):439-49. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0016.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike doxorubicin, moflomycin displayed no mutagenic activity in strains TA98 and TA100. Low mutagenicity was only observed in TA102 strain and was not enhanced after metabolic activation. This result indicates that moflomycin induce mutagenicity by reverting base-pair substitution. The structural changes in the sugar moiety may be involved in the reduced mutagenicity of moflomycin.

Micromononuclear megakaryocytes were detected in MDS, while in MPD, large over-mature magakaryocytes were observed to increase in number. In AA, the megakaryocytes decreased dramatically in number without showing any morphological abnormality. In CML, the megakaryocytes also increased without any remarkable morphological abnormality.

The most remarkable late effects of radiation are the functional and quantitative abnormalities of T and B cells in survivors exposed to high doses (> or = 1.0 Gy). Abnormalities of T-cell immunity include (1) a decreased proportion of CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes, particularly the proportion of CD4+ CD45RA+ naive T cells (study period 1987-91); (2) an increased frequency of CD4- and CD8- (double negative) alpha beta + T cells (1987-91); and (3) functional defects in T-cell responses to mitogens and alloantigens (1974-85). B-cell abnormalities include: (1) a significant increase in the proportion of B cells among peripheral lymphocytes (1987-91); (2) an increase in serum immunoglobulin A levels in females and immunoglobulin M and the incidence of rheumatoid factor in both sexes (1987-89); and (3) an increased level of anti-Epstein-Barr virus antibody titer (1987-90).

In addition, studies initiated sooner after the bombing such as the incidence of autoimmune diseases (1958-87), systemic bacterial infections (1954-67), and granulocyte functions (1947-79) also show little dose-effects.

Furthermore, specific enrichment of P-gp-expressing cells in magnetic cell sorting assays was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and functional assay for P-gp with Rhodamine 123.

The University of California Academic Geriatric Resource Program Student Survey Research Group.,1430-6,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the attitudes of beginning medical students toward older persons and their medical care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Five University of California medical schools. PARTICIPANTS: Beginning medical school students from the Class of 1994. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics, personal contacts with older persons, and previous coursework or research experience with older persons were assessed. Knowledge with regard to aging was measured with a group of 10 questions, which were modified from the Facts on Aging Quiz. The attitudes of students toward older persons were assessed using the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD), the Maxwell-Sullivan Attitude Scale (MSAS), and two case scenarios. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of the participants (554 of 603) responded; 93% of these responses were usable. Students were much less likely to admit an acutely ill 85-year-old woman to an intensive care unit, intubate her, and treat her aggressively than they were to treat an acutely ill 10-year-old girl with underlying chronic leukemia. In multivariate models, male gender and younger student age were both independently predictive of less favorable attitudes regarding a 70-year-old person on the ASD Instrumental-Ineffective subscale. Asian-Americans and males had less favorable attitudes on the Autonomous-Dependent and the Personal Acceptability-Unacceptability subscales. More knowledge with regard to aging was predictive of more favorable attitudes on the Autonomous-Dependent and Personal Acceptability-Unacceptability subscales. Male gender and Asian-American ethnicity were significantly associated with less favorable attitudes on the two scales derived from the MSASs. Students who had previously visited a long-term care facility were more likely to disagree that it takes too much time to care for older persons. CONCLUSION: Beginning medical students have already formed some unfavorable attitudes about older persons. Few independent predictors (either sociodemographic or students' previous experiences) of student attitudes could be identified that would help in the selection of students who had more favorable attitudes toward older persons. Hence, attempts to generate physicians with good attitudes must rely on curricular efforts during medical school and residency training.","['Reuben, D B', 'Fullerton, J T', 'Tschann, J M', 'Croughan-Minihane, M']","['Reuben DB', 'Fullerton JT', 'Tschann JM', 'Croughan-Minihane M']","['UCLA Multicampus Program in Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology 90095-1687, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Geriatr Soc,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,7503062,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Aged', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Geriatrics/education', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prejudice', 'Semantic Differential', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Students, Medical/*psychology', 'Withholding Treatment']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1532-5415.1995.tb06626.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Geriatr Soc. 1995 Dec;43(12):1430-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.1995.tb06626.x.,,12,,,,,,,,['KIE: 50634'],['KIE'],"['Empirical Approach', 'Professional Patient Relationship', 'University of California']","['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: patient care/aged', 'KIE: Full author name: Reuben, David B', 'KIE: Full author name: Fullerton, Judith T', 'KIE: Full author name: Tschann, Jeanne M']",,,,

This review has examined the immunohistochemical and molecular biologic tools used to evaluate soft tissue sarcomas of children and adults, in order to determine whether P-glycoprotein can limit the efficacy of chemotherapy. DESIGN: Because soft tissue sarcomas are successfully treated by cytotoxic substrates of P-glycoprotein in many, but not all children, these tumors may be useful models for determining whether this drug efflux transporter is a clinically relevant cause of chemoresistance. RESULTS: Certain studies of acute myelogenous leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma in adults and rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children have provided the best current evidence for a strong corelation between the expression of P-glycoprotein and outcome of chemotherapy. Based on these observations, several clinical trials have been initiated to determine whether pharmacologic chemosensitization improves chemotherapy responses and cure rates in P-glycoprotein-expressing malignancies. Thus, early identification of lower levels of P-glycoprotein in tumors that still might respond to chemosensitizer-modulated chemotherapy may be highly pertinent to conducting more informative multidrug resistance reversal trials. CONCLUSION: The question of whether the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein is a clinically relevant cause of chemoresistance may ultimately be answered by the successful prevention of chemotherapy failure by chemosensitizers that specifically reverse this drug efflux mechanism.","['Chan, H S', 'DeBoer, G', 'Haddad, G', 'Ling, V']","['Chan HS', 'DeBoer G', 'Haddad G', 'Ling V']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and Immunology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1995 Aug;9(4):889-908.,118,4,,['CA-37130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A prospective series of cross-sectional surveys of sexual behaviour reported by a standardised self-administered questionnaire in new patients who presented for screening and diagnosis. SETTING: A genitourinary medicine clinic in West London. SUBJECTS: 4089 consecutive newly attending patients who completed sexual behaviour questionnaires during 1982, 1987, 1989 and 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in socio-demographic status, sexual behaviour, condom-use, sexually transmitted diseases and other genital infections diagnosed by routine clinical and laboratory methods. RESULTS: Women reported significantly increasing condom use (from 3.6% to 20.7%) and decreasing oral contraception (from 51.2% to 40.1%), but the proportion who used no contraception (23.6% to 24.7%) and the proportion who had never been pregnant (58.3% to 59.9%) remained similar. Numbers of sexual partners in the preceding year decreased (p < 0.001) and an increasing proportion of women practised oral intercourse (p < 0.001). During the same period, there was a progressive decline (p < 0.001) in the incidence of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis by approximately two-thirds. However, the incidence of vaginal candidosis (p < 0.001), bacterial vaginosis (p < 0.001) and genital warts (p < 0.01) increased. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing use of condoms for vaginal intercourse with both regular and non-regular partners has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis. There was also an increase in the practice of fellatio and a change in the spectrum of STD and other genital infections with little net reduction in morbidity.

The analysis of class II gene regulation benefits greatly from the existence of mutants with defects in regulatory factors. We report the establishment of a subclone of the human monocytic cell line U937, termed C119/9, with unusual cytokine regulation of MHC class II expression. In contrast to the parental U937 cell line, only tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and not interferon (IFN)-gamma induces the expression of MHC class II antigens on C119/9 cells, and paradoxically, this induction was inhibited almost completely by IFN-gamma. The HLA-DR induction is controlled at the transcriptional level by the first 150 bp of the class II promoter which contains all the class II consensus elements. Both HLA-DR and -DQ mRNA are induced by TNF-alpha treatment, and both are diminished upon co-treatment with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.

Using a spontaneous transplantable murine model of B cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL1), we have demonstrated the expression of the B7 costimulatory molecules in addition to the previously described Id determinant and class II major histocompatibility antigens. Intact irradiated BCL1 cells bearing these distinct determinants induced long lasting antitumor immunity in naive syngeneic mice. Induction was dose-dependent and most effective when three doses of 30 x 10(6) intact irradiated BCL1 cells were given at intervals of 7-10 days. The induced immunity protected 96% of 28 mice inoculated with a lethal dose of 10(5)-10(6) nonirradiated BCL1 cells and 85% of 27 mice given a second challenge, whereas control mice died on day 20 after inoculation with 10(6) BCL1 cells. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes derived from immune mice did not induce leukemia in syngeneic recipients. Such splenocytes, harvested more than 365 days following immunization and administered together with fresh BCL1 cells to adoptive recipients, were able to confer protection for 90 days, even following a second challenge given 104 days after the first one. BCL1 immune splenocytes transferred into BCL1-bearing mice exerted a therapeutic effect, preventing leukemia onset for at least 180 days. Our results demonstrate the ability of tumor cells to trigger effective anti-tumor immunity. These findings could ultimately be applied to the prevention of tumor relapse in treatment of hematological and other malignancies expressing TAA, class II MHC antigen and costimulatory molecules.","['Morecki, S', 'Levi, S', 'Puyesky, Y', 'Slavin, S']","['Morecki S', 'Levi S', 'Puyesky Y', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Vaccines)', '372T2944C0 (roquinimex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Hydroxyquinolines/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01516998 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1995 Oct;41(4):236-42. doi: 10.1007/BF01516998.,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human MCP-1 (JE) is a potent chemoattractant and activator of monocytes and T lymphocytes and thus a good candidate gene for a tumor vaccine. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of vaccines consisting of irradiated tumor cells transduced with the murine MCP-1 gene in the syngeneic 9L gliosarcoma brain tumor model. 9L cell lines stably expressing murine MCP-1 (9L-JE) and control cell lines expressing neomycin 3' phosphotransferase (9L-Neo) were generated by infection with a Moloney murine leukemia retroviral vector. Fisher 344 rats were immunized with intradermal injections of 5 x 10(5) or 2 x 10(6) irradiated (5000 cGy) 9L-JE, 9L-Neo, and wild-type 9L (9L-WT) cells. Two weeks later immunized and non-immunized animals were challenged with various doses of intradermal (5 x 10(6)-5 x 10(7) or intracerebral (2 x 10(4)-5 x 10(5) 9L-WT cells. Intradermal tumors grew in all non-immunized animals. No tumors grew in animals immunized with irradiated 9L-JE or 9L-Neo cells and challenged with inocula of fewer than 5 x 10(5) 9L-WT cells. With higher inocula up to 10(7) cells, tumors appeared in all the animals, but subsequently regressed in the immunized animals. Tumors in animals immunized with 9L-JE were always smaller than tumors in the other groups. In addition, only the 9L-JE vaccine protected against tumor inocula of 5 x 10(7) cells. Thus vaccination with MCP-1-expressing cells was able to protect animals against at least a 100-fold larger number of challenge tumor cells than vaccination with control cells. In contrast to studies with intradermal tumors, immunization with 9L-JE and 9L-Neo produced only minimal protection against intracerebral tumors. There was no significant difference between the 9L-JE and 9L-Neo vaccines in intracerebral challenge. This study suggests that tumor vaccines expressing cytokine genes such as MCP-1 can increase the antitumor response. However, the protective effect of these vaccines appears to be largely limited to intradermal tumors rather than intracerebral tumors.","['Manome, Y', 'Wen, P Y', 'Hershowitz, A', 'Tanaka, T', 'Rollins, B J', 'Kufe, D W', 'Fine, H A']","['Manome Y', 'Wen PY', 'Hershowitz A', 'Tanaka T', 'Rollins BJ', 'Kufe DW', 'Fine HA']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Gliosarcoma/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Skin/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Vaccines, Synthetic/immunology']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01516997 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1995 Oct;41(4):227-35. doi: 10.1007/BF01516997.,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to develop reagents that could also be used to study protein:protein interactions, we have used in vitro selection to search for RNA aptamers that could interact with the transactivating protein Tax from human T-cell leukemia virus. Tax does not normally bind to nucleic acids, but instead stimulates transcription by interacting with a variety of cellular transcription factors, including the cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), NF-kappa B, and the serum response factor (SRF). Starting from a pool of greater than 10(13) different RNAs with a core of 120 random sequence positions, RNAs were selected for their ability to be co-retained on nitrocellulose filters with Tax. After five cycles of selection and amplification, a single nucleic acid species remained. This aptamer was found to bind Tax with high affinity and specificity, and could disrupt complex formation between Tax and NF-kappa B, but not with SRF. The differential effects of our aptamer probe on protein:protein interactions suggest a model for how the transcription factor binding sites on the surface of the Tax protein are organized.

In patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, this major obstacle can be overcome by rigorous T-cell depletion before transplantation. In leukaemia patients, however, the benefit of preventing GVHD is offset by graft rejection or graft failure. Very recently, this problem was overcome by supplementing T cell-depleted bone marrow transplants with megadoses of peripheral blood stem cells collected by leukapheresis after mobilization of the donor stem cells with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In the present study, we further demonstrate in a mouse model (C57BL/6-->C3H/Hej) that escalation of bone marrow doses by four- to fivefold leads to full donor-type chimerism in sublethally irradiated (6.5 Gy) recipients.

Men who were employed for at least one year between 1977 and 1989 were eligible for inclusion in the cohort; follow up was up to the end of 1991. Three cases of leukaemia (index cases) had been reported among these workers before the inception of this study. This research was undertaken to estimate the relative risk of haematological cancer among mechanics working for the District of Columbia. RESULTS: Among the 335 male fleet maintenance workers, the all cause standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was 0.50 (33 observed deaths, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.35-0.70), and the all cancer SMR was 0.55 (nine deaths, 95% CI 0.25-1.05). Three deaths from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer were observed; the SMR was 3.63 (95% CI 0.75-10.63). In the subgroup with highest potential for exposure to fuels and solvents, the SMR for leukaemia and aleukaemia was 9.26 (two deaths, 95% CI 1.12-33.43), and the SMR for other lymphatic and haematopoietic neoplasms was 2.57 (one death from malignant lymphoma, 95% CI 0.06-14.27). All three lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer deaths were among car and mobile equipment mechanics (one was an index case). The two additional index cases were a fourth mechanic who died of leukaemia in 1992, after mortality follow up ended, and a fifth mechanic who was diagnosed with leukaemia in 1988 and is still alive. CONCLUSION: Many garage mechanics in this cohort regularly used petrol to clean parts and to wash their hands; some workers would occasionally siphon petrol by mouth. Benzene, a recognised cause of haematological cancer, is a component of petrol. Previous research indicates that garage mechanics may be at risk of leukaemia and other haematological cancers, presumably due to exposure to petrol; this study supports those findings.","['Hunting, K L', 'Longbottom, H', 'Kalavar, S S', 'Stern, F', 'Schwartz, E', 'Welch, L S']","['Hunting KL', 'Longbottom H', 'Kalavar SS', 'Stern F', 'Schwartz E', 'Welch LS']","['Department of Medicine, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Gasoline)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'District of Columbia/epidemiology', 'Gasoline', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Occupations', 'Risk Factors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.52.10.673 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1995 Oct;52(10):673-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.52.10.673.,,10,,,PMC1128333,,,,,,,,,,,,

The population residing on the contaminated territory was exposed to chronic combined irradiation (external gamma-irradiation and internal irradiation due to Sr-90 and Cs-137). The red bone marrow (RBM) was the critical organ affected as a result of radiation events in the Urals. In the early period, after the discharges of radioactive wastes into the river Techa (about 3 M Ci) started, cases of chronic radiation sickness (CRS; 940 cases, in total), postirradiation reactions manifested by changes in blood parameters (e.g., leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia), nervous system disorders, immunity changes and ostealgic syndrome were registered in a portion of those riverside village residents who had received the highest doses. Increased leukemia and cancer mortality and morbidity rates were noted among this population in later periods. No late effects were observed in residents exposed to an explosion in a radioactive waste depot in September, 1957 when radioactive wastes with about 20 M Ci of activity were released into the environment. Similarly, the offspring of the residents exposed on the Techa also did not display any late effects.

Within a few weeks, hematopoietic recovery was substantial but slight depression of blood counts was maintained for several years. One case of fatal acute myeloblastic leukemia developed in a boy receiving 1.9 Gy as an infant. Cretinism developed in two boys exposed as infants with estimated thyroidal dose in excess of 50 Gy.

The role of stable chromosomal aberrations as indicators of radiation effects is not yet known. Stable chromosome aberrations persist longer in radiation-exposed individuals because cells with monocentric aberrations (= stable) have a higher probability of survival after cell division than multicentric or acentric aberrations (= unstable). Aberrations were investigated in 89 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia undergoing total body irradiation (TBI) for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Serial follow-up investigations were performed in 31 patients by analyzing lymphocytes of the peripheral blood. Patients had TBI of 10 to 12 Gy as conditioning therapy for BMT. Stable anomalies were investigated by Giemsa-banding and karyotyping in addition to standard analysis. A very high number of cells with stable aberrations was found up to five years after TBI. Investigations of the blood showed that a considerable number of cells with stable aberrations derive from radiation-damaged and clonally expanded hemopoietic precursor cells. We conclude that stable aberrations are useful as indicators of radiation effects in human beings. Clonal stable aberrations represent cellular radiation effects conserved at the stem cell level. Stable aberrations should be analyzed not only by the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome painting probes, but also by karyotyping. The latter is necessary to detect stem cell effects by proving the clonal expansion of chromosomal aberrations, and should be performed with the assistance of an automatic chromosome analysis system.","['Heinze, B', 'Arnold, R', 'Rutzen-Loesevitz, L', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Heinze B', 'Arnold R', 'Rutzen-Loesevitz L', 'Fliedner TM']","['Department of Clinical Physiology, Occupational and Social Medicine, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Blood Cells/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Radiobiology', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Stem Cells. 1995 May;13 Suppl 1:191-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is probable that the core proteins and lipids differ on the different cell types since there is marked variability in the binding of the mAb within and among the different cell types. Previously, there had only been a single mAb of the IgG class directed to CD15. The present study demonstrates the existence of one more IgG mAb (an IgG3). Unfortunately, a third mAb submitted as an IgG1, MA14, did not appear to be an IgG in our studies and a fourth mAb, MA9, submitted as an IgG1 did not have significant binding activity and also could not be confirmed as anti-CD15. An interesting finding was that all of the mAb could mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity with rabbit serum. However, the two IgG3 mAb, MA63 (MCS-1) and MA88 (7C3), could not mediate lysis with human complement, while all of the IgM mAb could do so. It is not clear why this difference exists. CD15 is known to be expressed on mature myeloid cells in the hematopoietic lineage. The expression of CD15 on progenitor cells has been mapped by the indirect method of C'-dependent lysis and measurement of colony-forming cells. These studies have estimated that about 50% of normal CFU-GM express CD15. In the present workshop, we examined the expression of CD15 on a quantifiable cell population, the CD34 positive population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ball, E D']",['Ball ED'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Morphol,European journal of morphology,9011462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/analysis/*immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Morphol. 1995 Apr;33(2):95-100.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An expression is derived for the component of the total GMF that is parallel, at an elevation beta, to the circuital magnetic field that surrounds the line. This component is a function of the angles alpha and beta, the total geomagnetic intensity BT, and the angle theta between the axis of the power line and magnetic north. Plotting these geomagnetic parameters for known leukemia residences allows one to test for possible ion cyclotron resonance or other GMF interactions. This approach, in principle, is an easy addition to existing or planned studies, because residential access is not required to obtain local values for alpha, beta, theta, and BT.

This cell line was used to characterize methotrexate (MTX) influx mediated by folate receptor-beta and to compare this with influx mediated by the reduced folate carrier in L1210 parental cells. Influx of 0.2 microM MTX in F2-MTXrA cells was one-third that of L1210 cells and was abolished by very low concentrations of folic acid. Kinetic analysis revealed that MTX transport mediated by folate receptor-beta exhibited an influx kappa t one-third, and an influx Vmax one-fourth, that of the reduced folate carrier. Metabolic inhibitors markedly suppressed influx in F2-MTXrA cells but had no effect on MTX influx in L1210 cells. MTX influx in both cell lines was inhibited by the organic anions probenecid, sulfobromophthalein, and CI-920, but to a lesser extent in F2-MTXrA cells. The inhibitory effects of these anions on transport in F2-MTXrA cells could be attributed to their inhibition of MTX binding to the folate receptor. Although MTX influx in both cell lines was not sodium dependent, removal of extracellular chloride increased influx 2-fold in L1210 cells while markedly inhibiting influx in F2-MTXrA cells. Substitution of Cl- with isethionate or NO3- partially restored influx in the latter cells, whereas SO4(2-) was inhibitory. Anions enhanced MTX binding to folate receptor-beta with isethionate > SO4(2-) > Cl-. Decreasing the buffer pH to 6.2 produced a 69% reduction, and a 260% increase, in MTX influx in L1210 cells and F2-MTXrA cells, respectively. The data indicate that folate receptor-beta-mediated MTX influx has properties fundamentally different from transport mediated by the reduced folate carrier in terms of energy, ion, and pH dependence. There was no evidence indicating that these processes are functionally linked.","['Sierra, E E', 'Brigle, K E', 'Spinella, M J', 'Goldman, I D']","['Sierra EE', 'Brigle KE', 'Spinella MJ', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/12 00:00,1995/10/12 00:01,['1995/10/12 00:00'],"['1995/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(95)94097-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)94097-y [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Oct 12;50(8):1287-94. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)94097-y.,,8,,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increases in activities of both protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) have been reported to be associated with the TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells. In the present study, a 2-fold increase in PTP activity was observed in SW620 human colon cancer cells after 30 min of TPA treatment; a maximal level (4- to 5-fold) was reached at 60 min and continued for more than 6 hr. In addition, two TPA-induced differentiated characteristics, morphological alteration and release of cellular surface proteoglycan, were effectively blocked by PTP inhibitors, such as sodium orthovanadate (50 microM), zinc chloride (100 microM), and iodoacetate (250 microM), but not by the protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (20 nM). On the other hand, although TPA induced a transient slight increase in PTK activity (1.4-fold) at 60 min, four PTK inhibitors (genistein, herbimycin A, tyrphostin-23 and quercetin) had different effects on the TPA-induced release of cell surface proteoglycan. Genistein (60 microM) potentiated this process, but in contrast, quercetin (45 microM) could partially inhibit the TPA effect. Taken together, these observations suggest that both PTP and PTK activities were increased in SW620 cells in response to TPA; however, the activation of PTP seems to be preferentially required for the TPA-induced differentiation of SW620 human colon cancer cells.","['Kuo, M L', 'Huang, T S', 'Lin, J K']","['Kuo ML', 'Huang TS', 'Lin JK']","['Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Proteoglycans/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",1995/10/12 00:00,1995/10/12 00:01,['1995/10/12 00:00'],"['1995/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['000629529500261W [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)00261-w [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Oct 12;50(8):1217-22. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00261-w.,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its mechanism of action was unclear, and we were interested in determining its mechanism of cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. We found chromosome breaks, gaps, and exchanges in P388 ascites cells from BD2F1 mice treated with 200 mg/kg PEN. Maximal observed damage occurred 24 hr after drug administration. Alkaline elution indicated only limited DNA strand breaks and interstrand cross-linking. In vitro, PEN (75 micrograms/mL) inhibited RNA and DNA syntheses almost completely. In addition, incubation of [14C]PEN with rat liver S-9 fraction in the presence of calf thymus DNA resulted in the stable transfer of radioactivity to DNA. Addition of butylated hydroxytoluene, a free radical scavenger, to the incubation mixture inhibited the binding of drug to DNA, implicating free radicals as the ultimate reactive species. These data suggest that PEN can be metabolized to free radical, DNA-reactive products, and that its cytotoxicity is due to chromosomal damage produced by monofunctional alkylation. As an alternate mechanism, the ability of PEN to inhibit cellular dihydroorotate dehydrogenase was explored. Although PEN is an inhibitor of this enzyme in cells in vivo, in vitro, and in isolated cell sonicates, HPLC analyses of ribonucleotide triphosphate pools in P388 cells showed that all triphosphates had increased, especially UTP. Addition of uridine to the cell culture failed to prevent PEN-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis was not likely to be an important mechanism of action of this drug. These data suggest that PEN is activated in cells to a free radical that binds DNA.","['Benvenuto, J A', 'Hittelman, W N', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Plunkett, W', 'Pandita, T K', 'Farquhar, D', 'Newman, R A']","['Benvenuto JA', 'Hittelman WN', 'Zwelling LA', 'Plunkett W', 'Pandita TK', 'Farquhar D', 'Newman RA']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Picolines)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '66Q80IL7CW (penclomedine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.3.98.1 (Dihydroorotate Oxidase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Dihydroorotate Oxidase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Malondialdehyde/analysis', 'Picolines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1995/10/12 00:00,1995/10/12 00:01,['1995/10/12 00:00'],"['1995/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(95)00251-T [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)00251-t [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Oct 12;50(8):1157-64. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00251-t.,,8,,['N01-CM-17562/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

UTP as phosphate donor was shown to follow strictly Michaelis kinetics, with Km = 1 microM, in striking contrast to ATP, which exhibits marked negative cooperativity (Hill coef. = 0.7) with a several-fold higher Kmapp = 15 microM. Phosphate transfer was followed directly with use of mixtures of [gamma-32P]ATP and cold UTP as donors, or with 3H-labeled acceptors and cold donors. With equimolar concentrations of ATP and UTP (50 microM or 1 mM each), and dCyd or dAdo as acceptor, only minimal phosphate transfer occurred from ATP (3-10%). With a 6:1 ratio of ATP:UTP, hence exceeding the intracellular ratio, phosphate transfer from ATP increased, but still did not exceed 25-40% with either dCyd or dAdo as acceptor. Moreover, relative ATP transfer is dependent on the dCyd concentration. We conclude that the major intracellular phosphate donor for dCK is not ATP, but UTP. Preliminary data for human thymidine kinases (TK1 and TK2) exhibit quite different behaviour. The foregoing, together with literature data, are highly relevant to in vitro studies on the properties of the nucleoside kinases, and to the design of chemotherapeutically active nucleoside analogues.","['Krawiec, K', 'Kierdaszuk, B', 'Eriksson, S', 'Munch-Petersen, B', 'Shugar, D']","['Krawiec K', 'Kierdaszuk B', 'Eriksson S', 'Munch-Petersen B', 'Shugar D']","['University of Warsaw, Department of Biophysics, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Spleen/enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tritium', 'Uridine Triphosphate/*metabolism']",1995/11/02 00:00,1995/11/02 00:01,['1995/11/02 00:00'],"['1995/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X85725892 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1995.2589 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1995 Nov 2;216(1):42-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1995.2589.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After CTx treatment, the initial inhibition of the oxidative burst induced by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) was followed by a progressive increase over 20 h, resulting in 4-6-fold potentiation of the initial burst. Various cyclic-AMP-elevating agents produced similar potentiation of the FMLP- or C5a-induced oxidative burst, but the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced oxidative burst was not affected by CTx pretreatment of cells. Furthermore, the increase in arachidonate release and intracellular Ca2+ triggered by FMLP were amplified after CTx treatment. ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha subunits catalysed by pertussis toxin was slightly increased after CTx treatment, despite similar immunoreactivity of the alpha subunit of Gi2. FMLP binding sites present in CTx-treated membranes were 3-6 times more abundant than in control membranes. Expression of mRNAs encoding the FMLP receptor and one of its related receptors were enhanced after CTx treatment of both undifferentiated and undifferentiated U937 cells. In parallel, after undifferentiated cells were treated with CTx, they were able to increase intracellular Ca2+, but not the oxidative burst, in response to FMLP. These data demonstrate that CTx, by increasing cyclic AMP, enhances the expression of chemotactic receptors independently of U937 cell differentiation.","['Fischer, T', 'Zumbihl, R', 'Armand, J', 'Casellas, P', 'Rouot, B']","['Fischer T', 'Zumbihl R', 'Armand J', 'Casellas P', 'Rouot B']","['INSERM U-431, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/*metabolism', 'Respiratory Burst/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3110995 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Nov 1;311 ( Pt 3):995-1000. doi: 10.1042/bj3110995.,,,,,PMC1136100,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive indicator, fura 2, and allowed to adhere to either glass or monolayers of human umbilical-vein endothelial cells. Addition of ATP or UTP (1-10 microM) to the superfusate produced a transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the lymphocytes adherent to endothelium (24 of 35 cells). In contrast, ATP or UTP (1-10 microM) had no effect on the cytosolic Ca2+ of lymphocytes attached to glass. As the only lymphocyte receptor for ATP (P2Z class) requires higher ATP concentrations ( > 50 microM) for Ca2+ influx and is unresponsive to UTP, the involvement of a lymphocyte P2Z purinoceptor is unlikely. Various agonists including ATP, UTP, 2-methylthioATP, ADP and histamine all stimulated increases in endothelial cytosolic Ca2+ but only ATP and UTP (both agonists for endothelial P2U purinoceptors) triggered Ca2+ transients in adherent lymphocytes. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ did not abolish the ATP-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in lymphocytes adherent to endothelial cells. These findings show that stimulation of endothelial P2U purinoceptors triggers an endothelial-lymphocyte signalling pathway which releases internal Ca2+ in adherent lymphocytes.","['Wiley, J S', 'Chen, J R', 'Jamieson, G P', 'Thurlow, P J']","['Wiley JS', 'Chen JR', 'Jamieson GP', 'Thurlow PJ']","['Department of Haematology, Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorometry', 'Fura-2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Umbilical Veins', 'Uridine Triphosphate/*pharmacology']",1995/10/15 00:00,1995/10/15 00:01,['1995/10/15 00:00'],"['1995/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3110589 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Oct 15;311 ( Pt 2):589-94. doi: 10.1042/bj3110589.,,,,,PMC1136040,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicate a differential regulation of the two enzymic isoforms by tri-iodothyronine (T3) in K562 cells in culture: an increase in the specific mRNA during T3-stimulation is shown only for the skeletal muscle isoenzyme. A fast and transient T3 induction of the accumulation of the specific mRNA can be observed, reaching a maximum 8 h after hormone treatment and then rapidly decreasing almost to the steady-state level after 24 h. A nuclear run-on assay was performed to explore the mechanisms of this regulation. These studies indicate that T3 induction of skeletal muscle acylphosphatase mRNA is due, at least in part, to a fast and transient increase in the rate of gene transcription, within 4 h after hormone administration. A very rapid decrease is then observed within a further 2 h. T3-dependent accumulation of the mRNA for the skeletal muscle acylphosphatase requires ongoing protein synthesis, as confirmed by inhibition with cycloheximide or puromycin.

After removal of autoantibodies, 85% of the sera still contained alloantibodies whereas in 15% of the sera no alloreactivity was detectable. Absorption of high PRA sera with K562 cells and with autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines derived by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-LCL) gave substantially the same results. As autoantibodies have reportedly no effect on kidney graft survival, the autoabsorption of high PRA sera may increase the chance of patients in whom only autoantibodies were detected to receive the transplant. Application of K562 cells, instead of autologous lymphocytes/lymphoblasts, is recommended whenever high numbers of patient's cells are not available. It may be particularly suitable for routine clinical laboratories, not equipped and prepared for derivation and propagation of EBV-LCL.","['Baldy-Chudzik, K', 'Nowakowska, B', 'Kusnierczyk, P', 'Matej, H']","['Baldy-Chudzik K', 'Nowakowska B', 'Kusnierczyk P', 'Matej H']","['Laboratory of Tissue Immunology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autoantibodies/*blood/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunization', '*Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Isoantibodies/*blood/immunology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*blood/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/immunology', '*Renal Dialysis', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1994;42(3):223-6.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help clarify the physiological function of this protein, particularly in humans, a full-length human liver cDNA clone was isolated, sequenced, and expressed in milligram quantities with the use of a baculovirus expression system. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein contained two thioredoxin-like active site motifs (CGHC) and in its C-terminus a nuclear localization motif (KPKKKKK), and an ER-retention/retrieval motif (QEDL). The mature form of human P58 shared 95% amino acid sequence identity with the deduced amino acid sequences of a bovine liver cDNA, 93% with a murine B lymphocyte cDNA, and 91% with a rat basophilic leukemia cell cDNA. In contrast to reports on the activities of nonhuman forms of P58, the purified expressed human P58 showed no carnitine acyltransferase or protease activities. However, it did have protein disulfide isomerase activity, indicating that the physiological activity of human liver P58 may be attributed, at least in part, to this activity.","['Bourdi, M', 'Demady, D', 'Martin, J L', 'Jabbour, S K', 'Martin, B M', 'George, J W', 'Pohl, L R']","['Bourdi M', 'Demady D', 'Martin JL', 'Jabbour SK', 'Martin BM', 'George JW', 'Pohl LR']","['Molecular and Cellular Toxicology Section, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Carnitine Acyltransferases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'EC 5.- (Isomerases)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Carnitine Acyltransferases/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Isomerases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1995/11/10 00:00,1995/11/10 00:01,['1995/11/10 00:00'],"['1995/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(85)70060-4 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.0060 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Nov 10;323(2):397-403. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.0060.,,2,,,,,['GENBANK/U42068'],,,,,,,,,,

In 1960, Nowell described the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and its relationship to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Subsequent work in molecular genetics and biology has revealed that the Ph is a translocation that causes fusion of gene sites that code for the break cluster region (BCR) and the avian blastic leukemia (ABL) proteins. This so-called fusion protein is present in a large percentage of the patients who have CML. A related fusion protein is seen in about one third of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in increased tyrosine kinase activity. The mechanism of action is thought to be via signal transduction related to guanosine triphosphatase activating protein which interacts with a ras-p21 binding protein. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with the cytogenetic abnormality of t(15;17). This alters the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene sites. Two fusion proteins are the result of this cytogenetic abnormality. They are termed PML-RARA and RARA-PML. Only one, the PML-RARA, is associated with APL. The PML-RARA chimeric protein has two zinc finger-like regions. It retains the ligand binding domain of RARA. The protein called PML has some similarities with a family of proteins which are thought to fuse to proto-oncogenes and to act as transforming proteins. The role of classical cytogenetics and the added capability of molecular biology has helped to elucidate some of the potential mechanisms for the development of cancer and provided additional understanding of neoplasia.

Associated diseases of HTLV-I infection, including a particular kind of leukemia or the development of a specific demyelinating disease, have also been observed. Screening of blood donors for antibodies to HTLV was mandated in November of 1988. This paper examines the biology of HTLV-I and HTLV-II and reviews the testing methods for HTLV-I/II. Data from 39,908 blood donations of volunteer donors at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC), Division of Laboratory Medicine, Section of Transfusion Medicine are presented. Initially reactive specimens for HTLV antibodies were 158 (0.4 percent). Of these 0.26 percent or 105 of 39,908 were repeatedly reactive. Eight hundred and sixty-seven cancer patients were also tested for HTLV antibodies. Eight or 0.9 percent were repeatedly reactive for HTLV antibodies by enzyme immunoassays (EIA), but only one could be confirmed as positive. HTLV-I/II has a very low incidence in the ambulatory population. The relationship of clinical sequelae and the rate of transmission of these viruses remain unclear. A readily applicable confirmatory test is not yet available. Even significant improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of testing will present ongoing problems for identification of true HTLV carriers. The clinical decision-making process related to the meaning of these results continues to be difficult.","['Fischer, H E', 'Lichtiger, B', 'Glassman, A B']","['Fischer HE', 'Lichtiger B', 'Glassman AB']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

To determine the clonal nature of the two malignancies, we microdissected the CLL and DLL cells from a lymph node of Richter's syndrome and analyzed the sequences of the rearranged Ig VH-D-JH genes of the two lymphomas. Using the Ig VH-D-JH sequence as a marker of clonality, we delineated the clonal relationship of the CLL and DLL cells. The microdissected CLL and DLL cells productively rearranged different VH, D, and JH genes, suggesting that these DLL B cells emerge as discrete elements independent of the CLL B-cell population. The productively rearranged Ig V gene sequence of the CLL clone was 100% identical to the VH6 germline gene, but the rearranged Ig VH gene of the DLL clone was somatically point-mutated based on comparison of its sequence with those of reported germline genes. In the DLL clone, the random distribution and nature of the somatic point-mutations suggests a lack of antigen selection; the identity of the somatic point-mutations in multiple independent isolates of the same B-cell clone suggests a lack of intraclonal diversity. Thus, Richter's syndrome DLL B cells are monoclonal and can emerge as discrete elements independent of the preexisting CLL cells; antigen selection and clonal diversification are not necessarily associated with the events leading to this aggressive neoplastic transformation.","['Matolcsy, A', 'Casali, P', 'Knowles, D M']","['Matolcsy A', 'Casali P', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/*pathology', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Syndrome']",1995/09/29 00:00,1995/09/29 00:01,['1995/09/29 00:00'],"['1995/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb55872.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1995 Sep 29;764:496-503. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb55872.x.,,,,"['AR-40809/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-68541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides specific for the leader sequence sense strand of each major Ig VH gene subgroup are used to probe the plate-tethered, alkaline-denatured, and single-stranded antisense cDNA. Bound probes then are detected with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies. Using this method, we assessed the distribution of Ig VH genes used by IgM-expressing blood B cells of normal adults. We found the predominant subgroup is VH3, representing approximately half (range 41-59%) of the expressed IgM repertoire. The next largest subgroups used are VH4 (19-23%), VH1 (15-17%), and VH5 (7-11%). The VH2, VH6, and VH7 subgroups each constitute less than 3% of the expressed IgM repertoire. These results agree with those obtained using traditional and more laborious methods that analyze the distribution of Ig clones in cDNA libraries. In addition, we find that this method compares favorably in sensitivity and specificity to more conventional techniques for assessing the clonality of blood or tissue B-cell populations. This rapid and nonradioactive method should have utility for assessing the Ig repertoires expressed by normal, autoimmune, or neoplastic B-cell populations.","['Rassenti, L Z', 'Kohsaka, H', 'Kipps, T J']","['Rassenti LZ', 'Kohsaka H', 'Kipps TJ']","['Sam & Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'NQ1SX9LNAU (Digoxigenin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology', '*Antibody Diversity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Colorimetry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Digoxigenin', '*Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",1995/09/29 00:00,1995/09/29 00:01,['1995/09/29 00:00'],"['1995/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb55866.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1995 Sep 29;764:463-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb55866.x.,,,,"['AG-04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether alcohol abuse affects the susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus infection or the subsequent development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a matter of extreme importance; however, available information in humans or animal models is limited. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of chronic EtOH feeding in mice on the development of immunodeficiency in the murine model of AIDS (MAIDS). C57BI/6 mice were placed on the Lieber-DeCarli liquid EtOH diet (25% or 31% total caloric intake) or a nutrient-matched isocaloric liquid control diet. Seven days later, mice were infected with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus mixture, and groups of infected and noninfected mice were assayed at defined time points postinfection for antigen-specific and nonspecific immune responses. In the absence of retroviral infection, chronic EtOH feeding (5-8 weeks) led to reductions in spleen weights, compared with isocaloric controls. In spite of reduced spleen size, mitogenic responses of spleen cells to concanavalin A (ConA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were elevated in EtOH-fed mice, as compared with mice fed the control diet. Chronic EtOH feeding also enhanced the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response and increased antigen-specific priming of both B-cells and CD4+ T-cells to the antigen, sheep red blood cells. In MAIDS-infected mice, chronic EtOH feeding delayed but did not prevent the onset of virus-induced immunodeficiency and MAIDS-induced autoantibody synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fitzpatrick, E A', 'Rhoads, C A', 'Espandiari, P', 'Kaplan, A M', 'Cohen, D A']","['Fitzpatrick EA', 'Rhoads CA', 'Espandiari P', 'Kaplan AM', 'Cohen DA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Kentucky, College of Medicine, Lexington 40536-0084, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)']",IM,"['Alcoholism/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Immunocompetence/immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb00967.x [doi]'],ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 1995 Aug;19(4):915-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb00967.x.,,4,,"['AA05341/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AA23497/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, the effects of supernatants derived from various cells on endothelium-dependent relaxation were studied. Cells were obtained from seven sources: human hematopoietic cells including mononuclear leukocytes (MONO), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells; cells of the cardiovascular system including human endothelial cell line ECV304, human smooth muscle cells, and rat myocardial cells; and the tumor cell line HPB. These isolated or cultured cells were incubated for 1 h in Krebs solution to release the factor. The results showed that the supernatants from 10(5) cells/ml of all cells except the tumor cell line HPB produced a potent inhibitory effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat aortic rings in response to acetylcholine and Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin but not on endothelium-independent relaxation to nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate. When the concentration increased to 10(6) cell/ml, the supernatants from the tumor cell line HPB also slightly but significantly inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation. The potency order was PMNs = MONO = CLL cells > cardiac cells > smooth muscle cells > the endothelial cell line ECV304 > the tumor cell line HPB. It seems that the hematopoietic cells and the cardiac cells are more active in release of the factor. The effect of this factor was rapid in onset and hard to wash out.

To clarify this matter, a semi-nested primer polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify the VDJ rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) gene of DNA extracts from 10 (8 sporadic and 2 endemic) BL cases. The resulting amplificates were sequenced for comparison with known germ line VH segments. The control cases comprised six cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and six cases of mantle cell lymphoma known to display naive nonmutated, ie, pre-germinal center VH configurations; and eight cases of follicular center lymphoma known to display mutated VH genes with signs of a still-ongoing mutation reaction, characteristic for germinal center cells and lymphomas that derive therefrom. The results of this approach revealed that both sporadic and endemic BL express mutated VH genes with a mutation frequency considerably lower (4.9% and 5.4%, respectively) than that observed in follicular center lymphoma (11.8%). In addition, after subcloning the amplificates, sequence analysis revealed no signs of ongoing mutations. These results led us to conclude that the derivation of neoplastic B cells in BL is definitely not from naive, nonmutated pre-germinal center B cells. Instead, our findings support the view that BL cells stem either from early centroblasts that are arrested after an initial hypermutation reaction, or from germinal center B cells that have differentiated in terms of surface immunoglobulin profile and mutation pattern but not in terms of morphology and proliferation toward SIgM+ IgD- memory B cells because of the deregulated c-myc gene expression.","['Tamaru, J', 'Hummel, M', 'Marafioti, T', 'Kalvelage, B', 'Leoncini, L', 'Minacci, C', 'Tosi, P', 'Wright, D', 'Stein, H']","['Tamaru J', 'Hummel M', 'Marafioti T', 'Kalvelage B', 'Leoncini L', 'Minacci C', 'Tosi P', 'Wright D', 'Stein H']","['Institute of Pathology, Klinikum Benjamin Franklin, Free University Berlin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Mutation/*immunology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1995 Nov;147(5):1398-407.,,5,,,PMC1869537,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A computerized data bank search, the minutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee published in the Federal Record, and reports of human clinical trials were used as data sources for this review. Clinical trials included in this review were published in the literature or approved by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. STUDY SELECTION: Evaluations of the efficacy of genetic modification strategies in clinical trials in human and in animal models are summarized. The design and outcome of the genetic modification strategies employed are reviewed for 16 marking trials, 16 gene replacement trials for molecular deficiency diseases, 3 chemoprotection and 4 chemotherapy sensitization trials, 11 cancer vaccine trials, 2 antisense oligonucleotide trials, and 3 molecular immunotherapy trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: The marking trials have shown that residual leukemia cells in the infused autologous marrow can contribute to relapse following autologous bone marrow transplants. The use of genetic modification for the replacement of missing or deficient genes in severe combined immunodeficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia, and cystic fibrosis has been associated with encouraging results so far. Clinical genetic therapy trials involving cancer vaccines, antisense oligonucleotides, adoptive immunotherapy with genetically modified T cells, delivery vectors containing interleukin-1 receptor inhibitor for arthritis, replacement strategies for storage diseases, and genetic suppression of human immunodeficiency viral replication are just commencing. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical application of genetic modification techniques has thus far been successful in the beginning phases of this field. These early results suggest that continuation of gene therapy trials designed to correct the molecular changes that lead to disease states in humans is warranted. Evaluation of such clinical trials in the future may be based on the analysis of assays for short-term surrogate endpoints, as well as on the therapeutic outcomes of the trial, such as survival or remission.","['Hanania, E G', 'Kavanagh, J', 'Hortobagyi, G', 'Giles, R E', 'Champlin, R', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Hanania EG', 'Kavanagh J', 'Hortobagyi G', 'Giles RE', 'Champlin R', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Genetic Therapy/methods', 'HIV Infections/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002934399802320 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(99)80232-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1995 Nov;99(5):537-52. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(99)80232-0.,73,5,,"['P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality rates for the cohort were compared to both U.S. and state mortality rates, and analyses were also performed by lagging duration of employment. Based on U.S. rates, mortality among hourly males (n = 3,853) from all cancers was similar to expected [standardized mortality ratio (SMR), 102; 95% confidence interval (CI), 92-114].

Immunophenotyping allows for rapid and reproducible diagnosis in the majority of cases of acute leukemia. It is of particular importance in recognizing the major immunologic subclasses of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and in identifying subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) which cannot be differentiated by morphology and cytochemistry alone, such as FAB M0 or M7. Immune marker analysis has been used to detect minimal residual disease in patients' bone marrow and CSF after treatment. However, the presence of leukemia-associated phenotypes on small numbers of normal cells may reduce the sensitivity of detection in some cases. The prognostic value of immune markers in AML is limited. In ALL, the prognostic significance of the different immunophenotypic subtypes has been lessened by modern treatment protocols. The relationship of mixed-lineage or biphenotypic antigen expression to patient outcome in both AML and ALL is unclear. Therapeutic applications of MoAbs in acute leukemia include immunologic techniques for purging malignant cells from autografts prior to transplantation, T-lymphocyte depletion from allografts as a strategy to reduce graft-versus-host disease, and the use of flow cytometry to monitor the timing and extent of leukapheresis in peripheral stem cell transplantation. MoAbs have also enabled the recent development of transplantation protocols using positively-selected CD34+ stem cells.","['Wang, J C', 'Beauregard, P', 'Soamboonsrup, P', 'Neame, P B']","['Wang JC', 'Beauregard P', 'Soamboonsrup P', 'Neame PB']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hamilton Civic Hospitals, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830500307 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 Nov;50(3):188-99. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830500307.,159,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were assessed at 48 hr intervals for decrease in stool volume from baseline. Complete response (CR) was defined as > or = 50% from baseline stool volume (BSV). Patients receiving octreotide who did not achieve a CR at 48 hr were dose escalated by doubling the dose to a maximum of 2,400 micrograms with evaluations at 48 hr intervals. Patients receiving loperamide who did not achieve a CR at 48 hr had treatment discontinued. A total of 36 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, all were evaluable for intention to treat, and 31 were evaluable for initial response. Based on intent to treat at the initial 48 hr, patients receiving loperamide had a higher complete response rate (86% vs. 45%, P = 0.033) than did those who received octreotide.

The authors sought to quantify the risk in Jamaica of HAM/TSP associated with HTLV-I infection and cofactors associated with this disease among infected individuals. Between 1988 and 1989, prevalent and incident HAM/TSP patients and controls with other neurologic diseases were enrolled in a retrospective study. A second control group was composed of HTLV-I-seropositive, asymptomatic carriers in Jamaica, ascertained in a separate study conducted in 1988. Although HTLV-I seropositivity was not a component of the case definition for HAM/TSP, all 43 HAM/TSP patients were HTLV-I seropositive compared with two (4.0%) of the controls with other neurologic diseases. Given HTLV-I seropositivity, one cofactor associated with the risk of HAM/TSP was young age at initial heterosexual confidence interval 1.29-12.46 for individuals aged < or = 15; odds ratio = 4.26, 95% confidence interval 1.41-12.90 for individuals aged 16-17 years at initial intercourse).

We now report that RA induces a subpopulation of NTera 2/clone D1 (NT2) human embryonal carcinoma cells to differentiate into postmitotic cells with cholinergic properties (NT2-N cells). After growth for 6 days in the presence of RA (10 microM) low levels of the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were detected in NT2 cell cultures. ChAT activity in the NT2 cell cultures continued to increase for at least an additional 22 days to a final activity of 50 pmol ACh synthesized/min/mg protein. Immunohistochemical staining of RA-treated cultures demonstrated that only those cells with a neuronal morphology (NT2-N cells) expressed the human ChAT protein. Since such cells comprised a small proportion (approximately 20%) of the population, the ChAT activity per neuronal cell was estimated to approach 250-300 pmol ACh/min/mg protein. Cultures composed of > 95% NT2-N cells had significantly lower ChAT specific activities and this could be increased by either ciliary neurotrophic factor or leukemia inhibitory factor, but not by nerve growth factor. We conclude that NT2 cells provide a system in which to study the molecular events that underlie neurotransmitter choice during the differentiation of human cholinergic neurons.","['Zeller, M', 'Strauss, W L']","['Zeller M', 'Strauss WL']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL 33101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Dev Neurosci,International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,8401784,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism', 'Parasympathetic Nervous System/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['073657489500025C [pii]', '10.1016/0736-5748(95)00025-c [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Neurosci. 1995 Aug;13(5):437-45. doi: 10.1016/0736-5748(95)00025-c.,,5,,['NS23430/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association of poorer EFS with nephromegaly was confirmed when the comparison was adjusted by white blood cell count and age at diagnosis in a Cox regression model.

Although a few nucleotide substitutions were observed among the clones sequenced, no characteristic sequence variation was found in different disease manifestations, even in one family or different sources of DNA preparation.","['Yamashita, M', 'Achiron, A', 'Miura, T', 'Takehisa, J', 'Ido, E', 'Igarashi, T', 'Ibuki, K', 'Osame, M', 'Sonoda, S', 'Melamed, E']","['Yamashita M', 'Achiron A', 'Miura T', 'Takehisa J', 'Ido E', 'Igarashi T', 'Ibuki K', 'Osame M', 'Sonoda S', 'Melamed E', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Pathogenic Virus, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Africa', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier State', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'India', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Japan', 'Jews', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Melanesia', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'South America']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01724300 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 1995;10(1):85-90. doi: 10.1007/BF01724300.,,1,,,,,"['GENBANK/D38382', 'GENBANK/D38383', 'GENBANK/D38384', 'GENBANK/D38385', 'GENBANK/D38386', 'GENBANK/D38387', 'GENBANK/D38388', 'GENBANK/D38389', 'GENBANK/D38390', 'GENBANK/D38391', 'GENBANK/D38392', 'GENBANK/D38393', 'GENBANK/D38394', 'GENBANK/D38395', 'GENBANK/D38396', 'GENBANK/D38397', 'GENBANK/D38398', 'GENBANK/D38399', 'GENBANK/D38400', 'GENBANK/D38401', 'GENBANK/D38402', 'GENBANK/D38403']",,,,,,,,,,

In this study, three additional K562 cell strains were analyzed for their responses to poliovirus infection and found to be quite variable. K562 cells obtained from the ATCC established a persistent infection, similar to the K562-Mu cell strain, while the majority of cells from two other strains, K562-KI and K562-We, were killed by 4 or 11 days postinfection (p.i.), respectively. Several characteristics of the uninfected and infected cell strains were examined to determine if differences existed which could explain the dramatically different responses to infection. Since K562 cell strains can differentiate toward several cell lineages, the four strains were analyzed for physical and functional likeness to the original K562 cell line using well-established functional criteria to determine whether gross changes in differentiation state had occurred. Based on the lack of MHC class I antigen expression and a dose-dependent increase in globin synthesis in response to hemin, all three laboratory K562 cell strains were indistinguishable from the ATCC reference strain. Surface poliovirus receptor levels were also similar in all K562 cell strains, although four- to fivefold lower than those in HeLa cells. Most biochemical events in virus replication either were very similar among K562 cells or were slightly variable and did not correlate with the degree of cell killing. These included levels of virus production, levels of viral protein produced, and processing and turnover of viral polypeptides. The key difference between the cell strains which consistently correlated with cell killing was the degree of virus-induced host translation shutoff, which was always greatest in the most virus-sensitive K562-KI cells. In addition, levels of 2Apro produced in K562 cell strains did not appear to correlate with the levels of host protein shutoff. A related and novel finding in these studies which also strongly correlated with the outcome of infection was the ability of levels of intact p220 to recover by 24 hr p.i. in virus-resistant K562-Mu and -ATCC cells. These data suggest that the key determinants of outcome of infection in this cell model are cytoplasmic host factors related to cytopathology and not factors which may modulate levels of viral protein synthesis or RNA synthesis.","['Benton, P A', 'Murphy, J W', 'Lloyd, R E']","['Benton PA', 'Murphy JW', 'Lloyd RE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City 73190, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (poliovirus receptor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Poliovirus/*physiology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",1995/10/20 00:00,1995/10/20 00:01,['1995/10/20 00:00'],"['1995/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)71541-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.1541 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Oct 20;213(1):7-18. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.1541.,,1,,['AI-27914/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

TBI and transplantation of the mixture of activated cells were both required to produce the lethal effect. We now report the effect of human IL-2 activated NK, T, or NK+T effector cells on the development of acute and chronic GVHD and GVL in SCID mice bearing human leukemic cells. Ten days after being inoculated i.v. with 2 x 10(7) human U-937 or K-562 leukemic cells, SCID mice, hereafter termed hu-leukemic mice, were radiated with 4 Gy TBI and transplanted i.v. with 5 x 10(7) human IL-2-activated NK, T, or NK+T effector cells. Hu-leukemic control mice received neither TBI nor effector cell transplantation. Acute GVHD-positive control SCID mice were transplanted with 5 x 10(7) H-2-incompatible C57Bl/6 splenocytes following 4 Gy TBI. The mice were observed for signs of GVHD and leukemia for 90 days. Twenty of 20 non-effector cell-transplanted control hu-leukemic mice developed signs related to leukemia and died with leukemic infiltration in the brain, liver, kidney, and lung 50-65 days after inoculation. Flow cytometry (FC) demonstrated 21-89% human leukemic cell infiltration in the bone marrow. Fourteen of 14 hu-leukemic mice transplanted with NK+T effector cells did not develop signs of advanced leukemia but died within 17 days of acute GVHD. FC demonstrated no human leukemic cells in their marrow. Twelve of 15 and 18 of 25 hu-leukemic mice transplanted with either NK or T cells survived 90 days without any evidence of symptomatic leukemia (P < 0.01 compared with non-effector cell-transplanted groups). NK-transplanted hu-leukemic animals experienced mild-to-moderate acute GVHD during the first 10-20 days posttransplantation, but gradually recovered and did not develop chronic GVHD. Hu-leukemic animals transplanted with T effector cells manifested no signs of leukemia or acute GVHD but chronic GVHD skin lesions appeared 80-90 days after transplantation. We conclude that acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and GVL are associated but separable phenomena.","['Xun, C Q', 'Thompson, J S', 'Jennings, C D', 'Brown, S A']","['Xun CQ', 'Thompson JS', 'Jennings CD', 'Brown SA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40536, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation']",1995/10/27 00:00,1995/10/27 00:01,['1995/10/27 00:00'],"['1995/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Transplantation. 1995 Oct 27;60(8):821-7.,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, what role these cytokines may have in the regulation of coagulation inhibitors is poorly understood. While the hepatocyte is a primary site of synthesis for the anticoagulant protein C and S, it is also a major target cell for the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6. We have found that stimulation of HepG-2 hepatoma cells with IL-6 (5 ng/ ml) significantly increased the production of the anticoagulant cofactor, protein S, in both a time and dose dependent fashion. This increase was seen at both the RNA and protein level. A mouse monoclonal neutralizing antibody to human IL-6 suppressed the IL-6 effect in a concentration dependent fashion. IL-6 also increased the release of the C4b-binding protein but had no effect on protein C production. When combined with either dexamethasone or soluble IL-6 receptor, the IL-6 response was significantly enhanced. Oncostatin M, a functionally related cytokine, had a similar effect while other related cytokines, IL-11 and leukemia inhibitory factor, only had a marginal effect. IL-1, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha had no significant effect on protein S production.

We therefore recommend a baseline history and physical examination, with further directed workup only if there are abnormal findings.","['Smith, J B', 'Fenske, N A']","['Smith JB', 'Fenske NA']","['Division of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, University of South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['Child', 'Herpes Zoster/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Risk Factors']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007611-199511000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,South Med J. 1995 Nov;88(11):1089-92. doi: 10.1097/00007611-199511000-00001.,25,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the structure-activity relationship studies of catabolism and anabolism, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyguanosine (dFdG) emerged as a lead candidate among the difluoropurine analogs. The cytotoxicity, metabolism, and actions of dFdG on DNA synthesis were studied in the human leukemia lymphoblastoid line CCRF-CEM. The IC50 values of dFdG after a 72-hour continuous incubation were 0.01, 0.03, and 0.28 mumol/L for CCRF-CEM, K562, and HL-60 cells, respectively. A cell line deficient in dCyd kinase was equally sensitive to dFdG, suggesting that, in contrast to dFdC, dFdG may be activated by other deoxynucleoside kinase(s). Consistent with these data, coincubation with dGuo spared the dFdG-mediated toxicity; however, up to 500 mumol/L dCyd failed to reverse the toxicity of dFdG. These observations indicated that dGuo kinase, which phosphorylates arabinosylguanine, also appears to play a major role in activating dFdG. CCRF-CEM cells incubated with varying concentrations of [3H]dFdG accumulated dFdGTP in a dose-dependent manner; a 3-hour incubation with 1 mmol/L dFdG resulted in more than 600 mumol/L intracellular dFdGTP. This is in contrast to the gemcitabine triphosphate accumulation, which is saturated at 10 to 20 mumol/L of exogenous dFdC. dFdG metabolites affected ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in a lowering of the dCTP pool; this is in agreement with the effect of dFdC on dNTP pools in leukemia cell lines. The major effect of dFdG on macromolecular synthesis was inhibition of DNA synthesis. DNA primer extension over a defined template revealed that dFdGTP was a good substrate for DNA polymerase alpha and incorporated opposite C sites of the template. Unlike arabinosyl analogs, but similar to gemcitabine triphosphate, dFdGTP incorporation caused DNA polymerase to pause after one normal deoxynucleotide was incorporated beyond the analog. The unique activation requirements of dFdG, its novel mode of inhibition of DNA synthesis, and its potent toxicity to human leukemia cells make it a promising new antimetabolite.","['Gandhi, V', 'Mineishi, S', 'Huang, P', 'Yang, Y', 'Chubb, S', 'Chapman, A J', 'Nowak, B J', 'Hertel, L W', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Mineishi S', 'Huang P', 'Yang Y', 'Chubb S', 'Chapman AJ', 'Nowak BJ', 'Hertel LW', 'Plunkett W']","['Section of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '103828-82-6 (LY 223592)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1995 Aug;22(4 Suppl 11):61-7.,,4 Suppl 11,,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although gemcitabine did cause profound inhibition of DNA chain elongation, it was progressively incorporated through nascent DNA replication intermediates of increasing size into genomic DNA. Hence, in the intact cell, it is not a chain terminator, at least not in the absolute sense of the term. In comparison to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), the progression of incorporated gemcitabine from small nascent DNA fragments to genomic-length DNA was less complete. Furthermore, at equitoxic exposures, less gemcitabine was incorporated into DNA than ara-C. Studies of the effects of gemcitabine on ribonucleotide reduction in HL-60 cells revealed that dGTP pools, but not dCTP pools, were reduced by a 3-hour exposure to 40 nmol/L gemcitabine (the concentration that causes 50% lethality). This reduction was transient, and recovery of dGTP pool size was accomplished within 16 hours.

In cells, this drug is converted to its triphosphate (dFdCTP), which is incorporated into DNA and terminates DNA strand elongation. After incorporation of gemcitabine nucleotide into the DNA strand, one more deoxynucleotide is incorporated, and thereafter the DNA polymerases are unable to proceed (""masked chain termination""). Gemcitabine also inhibits DNA synthesis indirectly by decreasing cellular dNTP pools via inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Incubation of human leukemia cells (CEM) with gemcitabine leads to apoptotic cell death. Two types of DNA fragmentation were observed in the gemcitabine-treated cells: (1) large-sized double-stranded DNA fragments range from 5 kb to 500 kb with the majority of the fragments located at 50 kb, and (2) nucleosomal-sized DNA fragments. Both types of drug-induced DNA fragmentation were detected in exponentially growing cells and were much more prominent in cells synchronized at S phase. The gemcitabine-induced DNA fragmentation in either synchronized or nonsynchronized cells was inhibited by the DNA synthesis inhibitor, aphidicolin. Thus, incorporation of gemcitabine into DNA is essential to induce DNA fragmentation. The intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM inhibited the drug-induced nucleosomal DNA fragmentation but did not prevent the large-sized DNA fragmentation, suggesting that the nucleosomal DNA fragmentation is a calcium-dependent event, whereas the large-sized DNA fragmentation is independent of calcium. Furthermore, BAPTA-AM did not prevent the morphologic appearance of apoptotic bodies in cells incubated with gemcitabine, indicating that degradation of DNA to nucleosomal fragments is not an essential element of the apoptotic process. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also inhibited drug-induced nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, but prevented neither large-sized DNA fragmentation nor formation of apoptotic bodies. In contrast, aphidicolin inhibited both types of DNA fragmentation and blocked the formation of apoptotic bodies in the presence of gemcitabine. These data suggest that the generation of large-sized DNA fragments caused by incorporated gemcitabine monophosphate in DNA is critical in gemcitabine-induced apoptosis, whereas nucleosomal DNA fragmentation is not a requirement in this cell death process.","['Huang, P', 'Plunkett, W']","['Huang P', 'Plunkett W']","['Section of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1995 Aug;22(4 Suppl 11):19-25.,,4 Suppl 11,,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biologically appropriate measure of exposure is undefined, there are a multitude of exposure sources, and because the concern is with such rare diseases as leukemia and brain cancer, all studies have retrospective exposure ascertainment. Residential exposure assessment has been based on wire configuration codes of nearby electric power lines or on in-home measurements, both proxies for historical exposures of interest. Each has theoretical and logistical advantages and disadvantages. Appliance exposures are based on self-report, focusing on those used for prolonged periods in close proximity to the user, such as electric blankets. Workplace exposures have been assessed by job title, more recently supplemented with measurements.

In current scientific studies a controlled and stepwise reduction of the treatment intensity in early stage HD is investigated. Overall survival rate 20 years after treatment is approximately 65%. This figure is approximately between 15 and 20% lower than expected according to the rate of tumor control. This discrepancy is due to an increased incidence of certain other diseases, with an increased incidence of secondary solid malignancies as the main problem. We don't know the relative importance of disease-associated factors, hereditary factors or of treatment-associated factors for this increased incidence of secondary solid malignancies. Irradiation of large volumes is considered an important risk factor. Several retrospective analyses show that the incidence of secondary solid malignancies is significantly lower after limited irradiation compared to large field irradiation. The incidence of secondary solid malignancies after combined treatment with limited field irradiation plus chemotherapy is not higher when compared with chemotherapy alone. After chemotherapy alone this risk is comparable or less than after large field irradiation alone. Finally there is only a small risk of leukemia after treatment with ABVD. An influence of diagnostic laparotomy with splenectomy on the survival of these patients has not been observed. Several retrospective analyses and at least one randomized study with limited chemotherapy, combined with limited irradiation, showed a tumor control rate and an overall survival rate comparable to the figures after more intensive treatment. Based on clinical examinations, patients with CS I and II HD are grouped in low, intermediate and high risk levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Glanzmann, C', 'Stahel, R']","['Glanzmann C', 'Stahel R']","['Klinik fur Radio-Onkologie und Abteilung fur Medizinische Onkologie, Universitatsspital Zurich.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Praxis (Bern 1994),Praxis,101468093,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/complications', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1995/10/10 00:00,1995/10/10 00:01,['1995/10/10 00:00'],"['1995/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Praxis (Bern 1994). 1995 Oct 10;84(41):1140-7.,51,41,Neuere Therapiekonzepte bei Erwachsenen mit fruhen und mittleren Stadien des Morbus Hodgkin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LMPCR was more sensitive, allowing detection of a greater number of integrated proviruses. Reconstruction experiments using a cloned integrated HTLV-1 provirus indicated that > 100 copies were necessary to be detected frequently by LMPCR. To circumvent this problem, the LMPCR analysis was performed approximately 20 times per sample. Thus, for the MT4 cell line, the seven major integration sites were accompanied by approximately 20 clones of lesser frequency. For an asymptomatic HTLV-I carrier, nine integration sites were identified in a single amplfication, while a further 9 followed from 14 additional reactions. These findings show that there is a stochastic element to sampling HTLV-I integration sites by LMPCR, which tends to underestimate the actual number of HTLV-I bearing clones. Accordingly, those detected in at least two reactions represent the most abundant clones.","['Cavrois, M', 'Wain-Hobson, S', 'Wattel, E']","['Cavrois M', 'Wain-Hobson S', 'Wattel E']","['Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Res Virol,Research in virology,8907469,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'DNA, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stochastic Processes', '*Virus Integration']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0923251696805784 [pii]', '10.1016/0923-2516(96)80578-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Res Virol. 1995 May-Jun;146(3):179-84. doi: 10.1016/0923-2516(96)80578-4.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, over the next two decades, fluoroscope operators suffered lethal skin carcinomas. Later, case reports appeared concerning leukemia in radiation workers, and infants born with severe mental retardation after their mothers had been given pelvic radiotherapy early in pregnancy. Fluoroscopy and radiotherapy for benign disorders continued to be used with abandon until authoritative reports were published on the adverse effects of ionizing radiation by the U.S. NAS-NRC and the UK MRC in 1956. Meanwhile, exposure to the atomic bombs in Japan had occurred and epidemics of delayed effects began to be recognized among the survivors: cataracts (1949), leukemia (1952) and severe mental retardation among newborn infants after intrauterine exposure (1952). No statistically significant excess of germ-cell genetic effects was detected by six clinical measurements (1956), the F1 mortality (1981), cytogenetic studies (1987) or biochemical genetic studies (1988). Somatic cell effects were revealed by long-lasting chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes (1968), and somatic cell mutations were found at the glycophorin A locus in erythrocytes (1992). Molecular biology is a likely focus of new studies based on the function of the gene for ataxia telangiectasia (1995), a disorder in which children have severe, even lethal acute radiation reactions when given conventional doses of radiotherapy for lymphoma, to which they are prone. Also, obligate heterozygote female relatives can be studied for increased susceptibility to radiation-induced breast cancer, as suggested by clinical studies. The tumor registries in Hiroshima and Nagasaki now provide incidence data that show the extent of increases in eight common cancers and no increase in eight others (1994). The possibility of very late effects of A-bomb exposure is suggested by recent reports of increased frequencies of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid cancers and certain causes of death other than cancer.","['Miller, R W']",['Miller RW'],"['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced', 'Cataract/etiology', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/history', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Injuries/*history', 'Radiation Protection/history', 'Radioactive Fallout/adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1995 Nov;144(2):160-9.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This differential phototoxic effect has been exploited in preclinical models and a phase I clinical trial for the extracorporeal purging of autologous bone marrow grafts. Salicylate is known to potentiate the MC540-mediated photokilling of tumor cells. Assuming that salicylate induces a change in the plasma membrane of tumor cells (but not normal hematopoietic stem cells) that enhances the binding of dye molecules it has been suggested that salicylate may provide a simple and effective means of improving the therapeutic index of MC540-mediated photodynamic therapy. We report here on a direct test of this hypothesis in a murine model of bone marrow transplantation as well as in clonal cultures of normal murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. In both systems, salicylate enhanced the MC540-sensitized photoinactivation of leukemia cells and normal bone marrow cells to a similar extent and thus failed to improve the therapeutic index of MC540 significantly. On the basis of a series of dye-binding studies, we offer an alternative explanation for the potentiating effect of salicylate. Rather than invoking a salicylate-induced change in the plasma membrane of tumor cells, we propose that salicylate displaces dye molecules from serum albumin, thereby enhancing the concentration of free (active) dye available for binding to tumor as well as normal hematopoietic stem cells.","['Traul, D L', 'Anderson, G S', 'Bilitz, J M', 'Krieg, M', 'Sieber, F']","['Traul DL', 'Anderson GS', 'Bilitz JM', 'Krieg M', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Salicylates)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'O414PZ4LPZ (Salicylic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Oxygen/analysis', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylic Acid', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/drug effects/metabolism', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08731.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1995 Oct;62(4):790-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08731.x.,,4,,['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we demonstrate that Grb2 mutant proteins lacking amino- or carboxyl-terminal src homology SH3 domains suppress BCR-ABL-induced Ras activation and reverse the oncogenic phenotype.

Expression of the Grb2 SH3-deletion mutant proteins in BCR-ABL-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts and in the human Ph1-positive leukemic cell line K562 inhibits their ability to grow as foci in soft agar and form tumors in nude mice. Furthermore, expression of the Grb2 SH3-deletion mutants in K562 cells induced their differentiation. Because Ras plays an important role in signaling by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, the use of interfering mutant Grb2 proteins may be applied to block the proliferation of other cancers that depend in part on activated tyrosine kinases for growth.","['Gishizky, M L', 'Cortez, D', 'Pendergast, A M']","['Gishizky ML', 'Cortez D', 'Pendergast AM']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, SUGEN, Inc., Redwood City, CA 94063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Grb2 protein, rat)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",1995/11/21 00:00,1995/11/21 00:01,['1995/11/21 00:00'],"['1995/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.24.10889 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Nov 21;92(24):10889-93. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.24.10889.,,24,,['CA61033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC40536,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in c-kit may enhance or interfere with the ability of c-kit receptor to initiate the intracellular pathways resulting in cell proliferation. These observations suggested to us that mastocytosis might in some patients result from mutations in c-kit. cDNA synthesized from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with indolent mastocytosis, mastocytosis with an associated hematologic disorder, aggressive mastocytosis, solitary mastocytoma, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia unassociated with mastocytosis was thus screened for a mutation of c-kit. This analysis revealed that four of four mastocytosis patients with an associated hematologic disorder with predominantly myelodysplastic features had an A-->T substitution at nt 2468 of c-kit mRNA that causes an Asp-816-->Val substitution. One of one patient examined who had mastocytosis with an associated hematologic disorder had the corresponding mutation in genomic DNA. Identical or similar amino acid substitutions in mast cell lines result in ligand-independent autophosphorylation of the c-kit receptor.

Such immunotherapy probably acts by antibody-mediated neutralization of viral infectivity and is often thought to function independently of T-cell-mediated immune responses. In the present experiments, we studied passive antibody therapy using Friend murine leukemia virus complex as a model for an immunosuppressive retroviral disease in adult mice. The results showed that antibody therapy could induce recovery from a well-established retroviral infection. However, the success of therapy was dependent on the presence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Thus, cell-mediated responses were required for recovery from infection even in the presence of therapeutic levels of antibody. The major histocompatibility type of the mice was also an important factor determining the relative success of antibody therapy in this system, but it was less critical for low-dose than for high-dose infections. Our results imply that limited T-cell responsiveness as dictated by major histocompatibility genes and/or stage of disease may have contributed to previous immunotherapy failures in AIDS patients. Possible strategies to improve the efficacy of future therapies are discussed.","['Hasenkrug, K J', 'Brooks, D M', 'Chesebro, B']","['Hasenkrug KJ', 'Brooks DM', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/therapy', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1995/11/07 00:00,1995/11/07 00:01,['1995/11/07 00:00'],"['1995/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.23.10492 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Nov 7;92(23):10492-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.23.10492.,,23,,,PMC40637,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Abr protein is very similar to Bcr but lacks a structural domain which may influence its biological regulatory capabilities. Both Abr and Bcr have a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain similar to those found in other proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis by members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins, as well as a region of homology with the guanine nucleotide dissociation-stimulating domain of the DBL oncogene product. We purified as recombinant fusion proteins the GAP- and Dbl-homology domains of both Abr and Bcr. The Dbl-homology domains of Bcr and Abr were active in stimulating GTP binding to CDC42Hs, RhoA, Rac1, and Rac2 (rank order, CDC42Hs > RhoA > Rac1 = Rac2) but were inactive toward Rap1A and Ha-Ras. Both Bcr and Abr acted as GAPs for Rac1, Rac2, and CDC42Hs but were inactive toward RhoA, Rap1A, and Ha-Ras. Each individual domain bound in a noncompetitive manner to GTP-binding protein substrates.

A recombinant 14-3-3 fusion protein bound several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from antigen receptor-stimulated T lymphocytes. PI3-K was identified by immunoblotting and enzymatic assays as one of the 14-3-3-binding proteins in resting or activated cells.

Far-Western blots of gel-purified, immunoprecipitated PI3-K with a recombinant 14-3-3 fusion protein revealed direct binding of 14-3-3 to the catalytic subunit (p110) of PI3-K. Finally, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from activated, 14-3-3-overexpressing cells contained lower PI3-K enzymatic activity than similar immunoprecipitates from control cells.

The helicase is maximally active in G1 and early S phases; the ssDNA binding proteins are maximally active in late S and G2/M phases. An inhibitor of helicase binding appears in late S and G2/M.

In cases of pre-eclampsia, very intense staining was detected not only on the surface, but also in the cytoplasm of the villous-associated trophoblast.

Methotrexate transport was inhibited by each of the oligodeoxynucleotide analogs tested. Inhibition was most pronounced (IC50 = 0.21 microM, standard assay) for a 5'-cholesteryl heteropolymer consisting of 15 phosphorothioate deoxynucleotides with alternating deoxycytosine and deoxyadenosine (Chol-PS-d(CA)7C). Homopolymers with 15 deoxycytosine (Chol-PS-dC15) or deoxythymidine (Chol-PS-dT15) residues were approximately 2-fold less inhibitory than Chol-PS-d(CA)7C. The relative potency of transport inhibition by deoxycytosine oligomers of varying length was: Chol-PS-dC5 > Chol-PS-dC15 > Chol-PS-dC28 > Chol-PS-dC3. Substantial inhibition was retained in cells preincubated with inhibitors and washed prior to transport determinations and the inhibitor sensitivity could be increased substantially by reducing the concentration of cells. Mixed competitive and non-competitive inhibition was observed for each analog. In standard high-folate medium, Chol-PS-oligodeoxynucleotides (5.0 microM) had minimal effects on the growth of L1210 cells, but antagonized the cytotoxicity of methotrexate. The response to methotrexate (IC50 = 12 nM) decreased to the greatest extent (20.8-fold) in the presence of Chol-PS-d(CA)7C (IC50 = 250 nM). Under limiting folate conditions, Chol-PS-d(CA)7C alone inhibited cells growth by a process which could be reversed by folic acid. The results show that Chol-PS-oligodeoxynucleotides are among the most potent known inhibitors of the reduced-folate carrier. Direct growth inhibition of folate-deficient cells and antagonism of methotrexate cytotoxicity indicate that Chol-PS-oligodeoxynucleotides retain the ability to inhibit the reduced-folate carrier for several days in cultured cells.","['Henderson, G B', 'Stein, C A']","['Henderson GB', 'Stein CA']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/analogs & derivatives', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Thionucleotides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/25 00:00,1995/09/25 00:01,['1995/09/25 00:00'],"['1995/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['5s0306 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/23.18.3726 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1995 Sep 25;23(18):3726-31. doi: 10.1093/nar/23.18.3726.,,18,,"['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC307272,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the fusion protein the AML-1 runt homology domain, which is responsible for DNA binding and CBF beta interaction, is linked to ETO, a gene of unknown function. The primary sequences of the runt homology domain indicates no known DNA binding motifs, but is predicted to contain six beta-strands, two alpha-helices and a nucleotide binding motif. Mutagenesis of AML-1/ETO was performed to delimit the functional domains of the chimeric protein. Most mutations in the runt homology domain that resulted in reduced CBF beta binding also inhibited DNA binding, indicating that the DNA and CBF beta binding sequences are tightly linked. However, these activities were separated by a point mutation of residue 144, within the putative ATP binding motif, which nearly eliminated DNA binding, but did not affect CBF beta binding. Random mutagenesis identified the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic fifth beta-strand, adjacent to the putative ATP binding motif, as critical for both DNA and CBF beta binding. C-terminal deletion mutants of AML-1/ETO indicated that ETO sequences are essential for interference with AML-1B-mediated transcriptional activation, and that residue 540 defines the C-terminal boundary of a potential repression domain. Thus, these mutational analyses define the regions of AML-1/ETO which regulate its function and that may be important in promoting leukemia.","['Lenny, N', 'Meyers, S', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Lenny N', 'Meyers S', 'Hiebert SW']","[""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/11/02 00:00,1995/11/02 00:01,['1995/11/02 00:00'],"['1995/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Nov 2;11(9):1761-9.,,9,,"['5 P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-64140/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear, however, as to whether this irregularity in a p53-dependent signal transduction pathway controlling the G1/S checkpoint is causally linked to the most consistent molecular hallmark of A-T-namely, marked attenuation in the inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis at early times (< or = 2 h) after irradiation [radioresistant DNA synthesis (RDS)]. We report here that treatment of normal human fibroblast strains with inhibitors of calmodulin (CaM) (i.e. W7 and W13) and CaM-dependent protein kinases II and IV (i.e. KN62) prior to radiation exposure elicits an 'A-T-like' RDS phenotype, whereas treatment with PKC inhibitors (e.g. staurosporine) does not produce this response. Moreover, at 1 h post-gamma irradiation A-T fibroblasts undergo normal induction of p53 protein while exhibiting the RDS trait. At later times (e.g. 4 h) following irradiation, however, these A-T cells contain abnormally low levels of p53 protein, as do their lymphoblastoid cell line counterparts during the entire post-gamma ray incubation period. On the other hand, human cells which either lack the p53 gene completely (i.e. HL60 leukemia cells) or harbor a germline mutation in the gene (i.e. Li-Fraumeni syndrome cells) shut down their DNA replication machinery normally upon sustaining radiation damage. We thus conclude that the transitory delay in DNA synthesis routinely experienced by human cells in the face of radiation injury is mediated through a CaM-dependent regulatory cascade which involves neither PKC nor p53 protein. Accordingly, A-T cells appear to be malfunctional in at least two distinct radiation-responsive signalling pathways, one regulating the G1/S checkpoint and governed by p53 and PKC and another controlling passage through S phase and requiring CaM.","['Mirzayans, R', 'Famulski, K S', 'Enns, L', 'Fraser, M', 'Paterson, M C']","['Mirzayans R', 'Famulski KS', 'Enns L', 'Fraser M', 'Paterson MC']","['Molecular Oncology Program, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Repair/*radiation effects', 'DNA Replication/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1995/10/19 00:00,1995/10/19 00:01,['1995/10/19 00:00'],"['1995/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Oct 19;11(8):1597-605.,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the state of tyrosine-phosphorylation of crkl in normal tissues is unknown. In the current study, we identified mouse crkl by cDNA cloning and examined expression levels and tyrosine-phosphorylation of the mouse crkl protein during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. Tyrosine-phosphorylation of crkl was prominent during early development, but decreased at later embryonic stages and in newborn mice. Expression of both crkl and the related crk was ubiquitous in the adult. However, crkl differed considerably from crk in relative tissue distribution, and was more abundant in hematopoietic tissues. With exception of the lung, crkl was mostly present in a non-tyrosine phosphorylated form. Consistent with our previous findings in human patients, murine crkl was phosphorylated on tyrosine in leukemic tissues of BCR/ABL transgenic animals, but was non-tyrosine phosphorylated in normal mouse bone marrow. We conclude that this crkl tyrosine-phosphorylation by Bcr/Abl in hematopoietic cells is clearly aberrant and is consistently linked to the development of leukemia.

The Bcl-XL protein is a recently discovered member of the bcl-2 family which has been shown to protect cells from some forms of programmed cell death, but has not yet been implicated in the genesis of human carcinomas. In this report we explore the role of Bcl-XL overexpression in protecting cancer cells from p53-mediated apoptosis. Increased levels of Bcl-XL were found in a subset of primary human breast carcinomas, as well as in the breast cancer line, T47D. T47D cells were then transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the tumor suppressor p53 (p53ts). Although many tumor cell lines undergo apoptosis when p53 is expressed, the T47D transfectants remained viable at temperatures permitting wild-type p53 phenotype. This suggested that endogenous Bcl-XL could protect cancer cells from p53-mediated apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, murine erythroleukemia cells were transfected with bcl-XL and p53ts.

The HOX11 gene is located in this chromosomal band and is activated by translocations t(10;14) (q24;q11) and t(7;10) (q35;q24). Ectopic expression of the HOX11 gene appears to be involved in the development of T-cell tumors. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of HOX11 activation in pediatric ALL patients and to correlate gene expression with ALL immunophenotype. None of 53 B-lineage ALLs was positive for HOX11 expression, however, Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis revealed that four of 12 T-ALLs (33%) showed expression of the gene. In order to assess whether HOX11 expression is present in other pediatric malignancies we examined a panel of 20 tumor cell lines established from solid tumors and leukemias, but none of them showed expression of HOX11. Using our RT-PCR method we confirmed that HOX11 expression is not detectable in normal T-cells. These findings indicate that HOX11 expression in pediatric ALL is exclusive to T-ALL and does not occur in B-lineage ALL. The frequency detected by molecular techniques was significantly higher than the frequency reported in the literature based on cytogenetic analysis. These results support the notion that ectopic expression of the HOX11 homeobox gene is a crucial step in T-cell tumorigenesis.","['Salvati, P D', 'Ranford, P R', 'Ford, J', 'Kees, U R']","['Salvati PD', 'Ranford PR', 'Ford J', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, West Perth, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/05 00:00,1995/10/05 00:01,['1995/10/05 00:00'],"['1995/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Oct 5;11(7):1333-8.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If so, it is expected that overexpression of normal RAR alpha may perturb the RAR alpha/RXR heterodimer formation and also the differentiation of myeloid cells. We have described here the morphology and the RA response of human RAR alpha cDNA transduced murine bone marrow cells using a retroviral vector. Most of RAR alpha transduced cells displayed promyelocyte like morphology and their proportion of c-kit expressing population was increased remarkably compared with the control (Neor gene transduced cells). Furthermore, this morphology was observed even after these cells were brought into the semisolid culture containing IL-3 alone. Interestingly, immature RAR alpha transduced cells differentiated into mature granulocytes under the condition of the high concentration of RA(10(-6) M). We did not observe any effect of RAR alpha on monocytes.

There are three members of this family, two have been isolated at the sites of chromosomal translocations in T-cell leukaemia. The function of the LIM motifs is at present unknown. We found that the LMO-2 gene is highly conserved between mammals, Drosophila and yeast. As a first step to obtain a model system for studying the function of the LIM motifs we have isolated the Drosophila homologue Dlmo. In contrast to mammals Drosophila appears to have only one lmo gene. A 2087 bp cDNA clone was isolated from a larval cDNA library, encoding a protein of 266 amino acids. A second transcript with an alternative 5' end was identified in RNA from embryos. The Drosophila lmo protein consists of two tandem copies of the conserved LIM domain characteristic of the human LMO family and an extended amino and carboxy terminus, which is not present in the human proteins. The amino acid sequence similarity with human LMO-1 and LMO-2 in LIM 1 is 79% and 69% and in LIM-2 90% and 60%, respectively. In addition a short stretch of 25 nucleotides with a homology of 83% between LMO-2 and Dlmo is found in the 3' UTR. Dlmo, like LMO-1, has an intron after the second LIM encoding region, which is not present in LMO-2. It is expressed maternally and at a high level in early embryogenesis as well as in adults. Interestingly we observed that the Dlmo protein is immunologically related to LMO-2 and can be detected by immunohistochemistry in early cellular blastoderm embryos. The gene was localised to a genetically well characterized region (17C on the X chromosome) opening the way for identification of mutations.","['Zhu, T H', 'Bodem, J', 'Keppel, E', 'Paro, R', 'Royer-Pokora, B']","['Zhu TH', 'Bodem J', 'Keppel E', 'Paro R', 'Royer-Pokora B']","['Institut of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Bx protein, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Drosophila/embryology/*genetics', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes, Insect', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factors']",1995/10/05 00:00,1995/10/05 00:01,['1995/10/05 00:00'],"['1995/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Oct 5;11(7):1283-90.,,7,,,,,['GENBANK/X83037'],,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that drug-induced differentiation of leukemia cells is associated with genetic and enzymatic activations of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). In this study, to further investigate a relationship between PTPase activation and leukemic differentiation, we established TPA-resistant U937 variant UT16 cells. Unlike known TPA-resistant cells whose resistance is mainly due to lack or down modulation of protein kinase C (PKC), UT16 cells showed TPA-induced activation of PKC, Raf-1, and ERK/MAP kinases similar to the parental U937 cells. Interestingly, however, UT16 cells exhibited altered binding activity of AP-1 complexes, decreased ability to induce c-jun and c-fos gene expressions, and failure to differentiate to a monocytic lineage. Based on these observations, UT16 cells could be considered a novel type of TPA-resistant cell. Among UT16 cells, most of TPA-inducible PTPase genes, PTP-1C, PTP-MEG2, P19-PTP, HPTP epsilon, and PTP-U1, did not respond to TPA. Consistently, TPA increased PTPase enzymatic activity in U937 but not in UT16 cells. Taken together, activation of PTPases is well correlated with TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells. These findings indicate that gene expression and enzymatic activity of some PTPase isozymes described here are regulated by a TPA-mediated signaling event and are likely to be used as biomarkers for the monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells.","['Seimiya, H', 'Sawabe, T', 'Toho, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Seimiya H', 'Sawabe T', 'Toho M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/11/16 00:00,1995/11/16 00:01,['1995/11/16 00:00'],"['1995/11/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Nov 16;11(10):2047-54.,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether CldAdo incorporation into DNA inhibited subsequent transcription in vitro using purified phage RNA polymerases. Control (Ade-containing) and 2-chloroadenine (ClAde)-substituted DNA strands that contained a RNA polymerase promoter sequence were synthesized by a modified asymmetric polymerase chain reaction. Complementary (+) and (-) strands were annealed, incubated with phage RNA polymerase, and analyzed with denaturing PAGE. When ClAde was present in both strands, the yield of full-length transcripts (approximately equal to 100 bases) was reduced by approximately equal to 90% relative to control DNA. Transcription was also reduced to a slightly lesser degree when substitutions occurred in only one of two strands. The observed low transcript levels on ClAde-containing DNA were due in part to the presence of the analogue within the promoter region. With gel shift binding assays, we demonstrated that RNA polymerase did not bind as well to ClAde-containing promoters. Polymerase/DNA complex formation was decreased by approximately equal to 80% compared with that on control unsubstituted promoters. In addition, on binding to the substituted promoter, RNA polymerase had an altered conformation that led to enhanced proteolytic clipping by endoproteinase Glu-C.

Previously, we showed that the murine moloney leukemia virus LTR would drive beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) transcription for extended periods from the latent viral genome in sensory, but not motor neurons. In this communication we further evaluate the utility of the LTR promoter for use in long-term expression vectors. Following stereotactic injection of 8117/43 (an ICP4 minus, non-replicating virus with the LTR driving the beta-gal gene, or KD6 (an ICP4 minus non-replicating virus not expressing beta-gal) into the hippocampus of rats, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of viral DNA after 2 months indicated that latent infections were established. Assaying by both x-gal staining and reverse transcriptase PCR we demonstrate that (1) beta-gal can be detected for at least 6 months in hippocampal neurons, and (2) although the number of beta-gal transcripts in these cells drops considerably by 2 weeks, they can be detected during the period studied.

However, calcium modulators, such as calcium ionophore 4-bromo-calcium ionophore (Br-A23187) and thapsigargin (TG), induce apoptosis in different cells, including HL-60 cells in which the induction of apoptosis seems a calcium-independent process. These observations imply that the disturbance of calcium homeostasis is probably the most important factor in the regulation of apoptosis. In this article, reagents with different potencies of modulating calcium homeostasis were used to study the possible role of [Ca2+]i and the status of intracellular calcium stores in the causation of HL-60 cell apoptosis. We found that an increase in [Ca2+]i alone did not result in apoptosis, while the depletion of TG-sensitive calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum was closely related with the induction of apoptosis. In HL-60 cells, extracellular and intracellular calcium chelators promoted apoptosis. Calmodulin antagonist did not attenuate apoptosis induced by other reagents. Our results suggest that the depletion of Ca2+ stores is an important mean to modulate calcium homeostasis and that the mobilization of calcium (Ca2+) from intracellular stores, rather than an increase in [Ca2+]i, provides the signal for the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Zhu, W H', 'Loh, T T']","['Zhu WH', 'Loh TT']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Terpenes)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['002432059502202T [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(95)02202-t [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1995;57(23):2091-9. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(95)02202-t.,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spanish Group for the Study of HTLV-I/II)].",246-50,"BACKGROUND: HTLV-I is a human retrovirus which has been implicated in the genesis of tropical spastic paraparesia (TSP), adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and some patients with uveitis, subacute arthropathies and lymphocytary alveolitis. The virus is endemic in some zones of the Caribbean countries, Japan, subsaharian Africa, Middle East and Melanesia. Given that HTLV-I is transmitted by similar routes as HIV, anti-HTLV-I antibody screening is carried out in blood donors in some countries. METHODS: The clinical, epidemiologic and virologic characteristics of the patients with HTLV-I infection identified in Spain up to November 1994 are described. RESULTS: Twenty-four Spanish residents have been identified with HTLV-I infection including 16 Spaniards and 8 immigrants from endemic areas. Thirteen (53%) are males and 11 (47%) females. Most of the persons born in Spain (12/16; 75%) have lived in endemic areas or have maintained sexual relations with natives of them. Four patients were diagnosed with TSP, three with ATL and another with lymphomatoid granulomatosis and angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. The remaining patients were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Two HTLV-I carriers were identified on blood donation. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-I infection is present in Spain being found in Spanish natives and, to a lesser degree, in immigrants from endemic areas. It is therefore recommendable to analyze the cost-benefit of anti-HTLV-I screening in blood donors.","['Soriano, V', 'Gutierrez, M', 'Vallejo, A', 'Aguilera, A', 'Calderon, E', 'Franco, E']","['Soriano V', 'Gutierrez M', 'Vallejo A', 'Aguilera A', 'Calderon E', 'Franco E']","['Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/complications/epidemiology', 'Spain/epidemiology']",1995/09/09 00:00,1995/09/09 00:01,['1995/09/09 00:00'],"['1995/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1995 Sep 9;105(7):246-50.,,7,Infeccion por HTLV-I en Espana.

Histopathologically, OvLv diseases may be characterized by lymphoid infiltration, lymphoid hyperplasia with germinal centers and plasmocytosis in the lungs and/or in the CNS, joints and udder. Lymphoid hyperplasia in lymph nodes and spleen, as well as lymphoid infiltration in the kidneys, are almost always seen in advanced cases. In some cases, it shows similarities to lymphoproliferative diseases that are considered malignant. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in the lungs is generally also seen, especially in older goats with caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), and proliferation of these epithelial cells may form acine and papillary structures and in some cases are histopathologically indistinguishable from tumor nodules seen in sheep pulmonary adenomatosis. Because of complexities in the host-lentovirus interaction, cell-associated transmission and extensive antigenic and genomic variation among infecting isolates, control of infection or prevention of spread are problematic by traditional methods and exploration of alternative control strategies employing selection and expansion of animals genetically resistant to OvLv or transgenic for certain viral genes, merits consideration. Interestingly, the pure Awassi sheep breed are susceptible to infection but do not develop the disease, as do European breeds or cross-breeds in Israel, ie they are infected but not diseased. It seems that the local Bedouin black goat breed is resistant to infection of CAEV under natural conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Perk, K']",['Perk K'],"['Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis-Encephalitis Virus, Caprine/isolation & purification', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Goat Diseases/*virology', 'Goats', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lentivirus Infections/pathology/physiopathology/*veterinary', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/*virology', 'Species Specificity']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Oct;9 Suppl 1:S98-100.,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have evaluated the potential role of IL6, a myeloid differentiation inducing factor, in modifying myeloid leukemia cells, a tumor so far not challenged by this approach. M1 cells transduced with N2 based retrovirus carrying the murine IL6 gene exhibit morphological and functional alterations. Genetically modified M1 cells show significant reduction in the growth constant coefficient and in the ability to form hematopoietic colonies. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrate increased expression of CD11b, CD18, F4/80, FcR and MHC class II, suggesting driven differentiation towards commitment. Transduced cells secrete high level of autocrine IL6 and, upon activation with LPS, high levels of TNF further indicating a functional alteration and differentiation. The insertion of IL6 gene coding for signals of cell activation and improved expression of MHC antigens into myeloid leukemia cells may enable more effective tumor recognition in vivo, and boost the local as well as the systemic immune-mediated anti-leukemia response.","['Tsuberi, B', 'Naparstek, E']","['Tsuberi B', 'Naparstek E']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'CD18 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Retroviridae', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/biosynthesis']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Oct;9 Suppl 1:S93-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to explore the part played by P85 in tumor suppression, DNA was extracted from precancerous granulomas and from slow or rapid growing sarcomas induced by neonatal injection of the virus. The v-fes signal from extracted DNA was analyzed by PCR-SSCP. The prototype v-fes gene signal was detected in most lesions and found to be generally amplified in rapid growing sarcomas and in some granulomas. Several v-fes homologs showing varying mobilities in gel were seen in most sarcomas and some granulomas with or without the prototype v-fes signal. In slow growing sarcomas and granulomas induced in hosts that were immunized with ST-FeSV induced syngeneic sarcoma and proved to carry IgG antibody to P85, the prototype v-fes gene was found to be down-regulated and v-fes homologs were found to be reduced in number or eliminated. These results suggest that the development of v-fes mutations is associated with the growth potential of cells carrying the v-fes gene, and that host immunity to v-onc product influences the development of virogene rearrangements and results in slow and suppressed growth of tumors caused by neonatal infection with retrovirus.","['Maruyama, K', 'Fukushima, T', 'Miyauchi, M', 'Koshikawa, N', 'Kawamura, K', 'Mochizuki, S']","['Maruyama K', 'Fukushima T', 'Miyauchi M', 'Koshikawa N', 'Kawamura K', 'Mochizuki S']","['Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-onc)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-onc/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Granuloma/pathology/virology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Sorting Signals/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*genetics/*pathology/prevention & control/virology', '*Viral Vaccines']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Oct;9 Suppl 1:S89-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, treatment of AIDS has relied on nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT, ddI, and ddC, which eventually become ineffective upon the emergence of resistant mutants bearing specific nucleotide substitutions. The Anti-AIDS Drug Screening Program of the NCI conducts and coordinates a high-capacity semi-robotic in vitro screening of synthetic or natural compounds submitted by academic, research and pharmaceutical institutions world-wide. About 10,000 synthetic compounds are screened annually for anti-HIV activity. Confirmed active agents are subjected to in-depth studies on range and mechanism of action. Emerging from this intense screening activity were a number of potentially promising categories of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) with structural diversity but strong and reproducible anti-HIV activity. Over 2500 active compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against a panel of both laboratory and clinical virus isolates in the appropriate established cell line or fresh human peripheral blood leukocyte and macrophage preparations. Out of these, 40 agents could be placed structurally in nine categories with an additional 16 unique compounds that share the characteristics of NNRTI. These NNRTIs were shown to inhibit reverse transcriptase enzymatically using homopolymeric or ribosomal RNA as templates. NNRTIs demonstrated similarity in their inhibitory pattern against the HIV-1 laboratory strains IIIB and RF, and an AZT-resistant strain; all were inactive against HIV-2. These compounds were further tested against NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 isolates. NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 isolates were selected and characterized with respect to the change(s) in the viral reverse transcriptase nucleotide sequence. Also, differential cross-resistance or sensitivity patterns to NNRTIs were studied in detail among NNRTI-resistant mutants.

Human retroviral diseases fit two categories: (1) those that result from a monoclonal outgrowth of a human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected cell, as in the case of adult T cell leukemia (ATL); and (2) those that appear to result directly from virus load rather than monoclonal outgrowth--such as tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). For ATL gene therapy, corrective mechanisms directed at regulatory sequences rather than viral sequences may be most important, though perhaps anti-tax therapy would be useful. For TSP/HAM and AIDS, gene therapy directed to control virus replication may be most useful. For anti-retroviral therapy, one may use dominant negative mutants and a variety of other approaches that direct toxins or compete out viral regulatory gene signal sequences. For maximum benefit, such therapy should be directed to different essential genes (eg gag, pol, env, tat or rev) involved in the virus replication cycle and utilize different toxic approaches. A major impediment to the use of gene therapy for AIDS is our inability to transfect a significant fraction of target cells in vivo. Except for reconstituted mice, retroviral systems of animals have been under-utilized as models for gene therapy. Naturally occurring retroviral diseases of cats, goats, horses, and other species provide models for future development.","['Essex, M', 'Matsuda, Z', 'Yu, X', 'Lee, T H']","['Essex M', 'Matsuda Z', 'Yu X', 'Lee TH']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Goats', 'HIV', 'HTLV-I Infections/*therapy', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Oct;9 Suppl 1:S71-4.,13,,,"['CA-39805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-33774/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since hemopoietic stem cells do not divide rapidly, numerous semi-empirically designed multifactor cocktails have been used to stimulate them. In an attempt to find an alternative to this approach we have investigated the effects of the stem cell stimulatory peptide (pGlu-Glu-Asp-Glys-Lys)2, (pEEDCK)2, on progenitor output in murine long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC). (pEEDCK)2 may act by inducing growth factor production in stromal cells. Addition of (pEEDCK)2 to LTBMCs resulted in a three-fold increase in CFU-GM production. For showing an effect of (pEEDCK)2 on primitive hemopoietic cells (long-term-culture initiating cells, (LTC-IC)) LTBMCs were depleted of rapidly dividing progenitors by 5-Fluoro-Uracil (5-FU). LTC-IC survive and repopulate the culture with new CFU-GM. (pEEDCK)2 greatly enhanced this process (eight-fold in the second week after 5-FU). Enhanced progenitor production was observed for several weeks even after discontinuation of (pEEDCK)2 additions to the cultures (100-fold, five weeks after 5-FU, three weeks after end of peptide additions). This increase in progenitor production resulted in increased numbers of total nucleated cells. Our results suggest that (pEEDCK)2 may be a useful alternative for multifactor cocktails when proliferation of primitive stem-cell-like cells is required, as in gene therapy and transplantation. Our experiments also indicate that the redox equilibrium between (stem cell inhibitory) monomeric pEEDCK and (stem cell stimulatory) dimeric (pEEDCK)2, which are both endogenous constituents of LTBMCs may play a role in physiological stem cell regulation.","['Paukovits, J B', 'Paukovits, W R']","['Paukovits JB', 'Paukovits WR']","['Laboratory of Growth Regulation, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '84588-89-6 (hemoregulatory peptide 5b)', 'SZB83O1W42 (Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Time Factors']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Oct;9 Suppl 1:S48-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although transduction efficiency of retroviral vectors is higher than with conventional methods, selection of successfully transduced cells may become mandatory for efficient in vivo transfer. We have been evaluating a retroviral construct that meets the criteria for a clinically acceptable selection system. The Ser31 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mutant confers resistance to methotrexate (MTX) due to decreased binding of the drug. while its enzymatic activity remains adequate for normal folate metabolism. Transduction of this vector into murine hematopoietic cells has been recently described and increase in MTX resistance could be observed. We investigated transduction of CD34-antigen positive subpopulations of hematopoietic progenitor cells and CD34-positive/CD38-negative subpopulations enriched for stem cells. We focused on two sources of primary hematopoietic cells, umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood (PB) harvested from patients after mobilization with chemotherapy and/or cytokines. Both contain a large number of lineage restricted and pluripotent progenitor cells and can be expanded extensively ex vivo. Potential clinical applications of gene therapy in such cell populations include correction of inborn enzymatic diseases and support of high-dose chemotherapy by transplanting ex vivo transduced progenitor cells rendered more resistant to cytotoxic drugs.

To address this, we have developed an in vitro system for the selection and maintenance of a highly-enriched population of retrovirus-infected hematopoietic progenitor cells. Human umbilical cord CD34+ cells were cultured on SNL, a neo-containing murine fibroblast cell line used for embryonic stem cell culture. SNL-supported CD34+ cultures could be maintained with continuing blast cell and CFU-GM production for eight weeks, compared to four weeks in the absence of SNL. We then tested the ability of SNL to facilitate the selection in G418 of CD34+ cord cells infected with the neo-containing retrovirus, vsn-2. While all cells in the control cultures died within 14 days, vsn-2-infected CD34+ cells continued to proliferate, differentiate and produce CFU-GM for up to five weeks after infection. 100% of individually-plucked CFU-GM from such cultures were shown by PCR to be successfully infected.

The human HSC, which is CD34+Thy-1+Lin- has been isolated from fetal, adult bone marrow and cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) (1-3). Results presented in this study show that the degree of mobilization of HSC into peripheral blood of cancer patients is highly variable and that the combined use of high dose chemotherapy and GM-CSF as a mobilization strategy is superior to the use of G-CSF with regard to the mobilization of true HSC. A multistep cell isolation procedure has been developed which utilizes high speed flow-cytometric cell sorting and allows the isolation of sufficient numbers of HSC from MPB to permit their use as an hematopoietic graft for clinical transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cells isolated from MPB are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple hematopoietic lineages as shown by their behavior in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Mobilized PB mononuclear cells isolated from cancer patients are frequently contaminated with tumor cells. Using this cell isolation procedure, HSC preparations from patients with multiple myeloma have been created with greatly reduced tumor cell burdens. These CD34+Thy-1+Lin- cells are capable of being stably transduced at high efficiency (32-75%) by co-culture on a cell line producing recombinant retroviruses containing the neomycin-resistant gene.

The dose of G-CSF most commonly used for mobilization is 5 micrograms/kg. We measured G-CSF levels in patients with chemosensitive malignancies undergoing peripheral stem cell harvest to determine whether there was a relationship between serum G-CSF levels and the yield of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were mobilized by chemotherapy followed by G-CSF (5 micrograms/kg) started 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy. PBSCs were collected by daily leukapheresis during G-CSF stimulation once the WBC had recovered to 1.0 x 10(9)/L, with 10 liters of blood processed using a Fenwall CS 3000. G-CSF levels were monitored daily before and after leukapheresis. CD34+ cells from daily leukapheresis collections were determined in 11 patients. Immunophenotyping analyses of CD34+ and non-CD34+ cells for surface antigens CD38+, HLA-DR, CD71+, CD61+ and CD42a+ were performed on these daily leukapheresis. The mean (SD) number of days to neutrophil recovery (NR: > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L) after stem cell reinfusion was 9.2 (1.92).

To develop an animal model for in vivo study of such strategies, we transfected C6 glioma cells with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene and the human EGFR gene under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible MMTV promoter. Following selection with G418, individual clones that expressed EGFR at high levels were selected. Kinetics of EGF binding fit a dual site model indicating the presence of both high (KA = 2.5 x 10(9) M-1) and low (KA = 3.3 x 10(7) M-1) affinity receptors. To assess growth in vivo, graded numbers of either wild-type or transfected cells were implanted into the brains of CD Fischer 344 rats. No differences in survival were observed between groups of animals injected with either wild-type or transfected cells at inocula of 10(3) or 10(4) respectively. In addition, one-third of animals (7/21) challenged with 10(5) or 10(6) transfected cells survived > 50 days compared to 0% of animals (0/12) challenged with 10(5) or 10(6) wild-type cells. Such an effect suggests greater immunogenicity of transfected cells, but only at the larger inocula. Since C6 glioma cells will grow in both outbred and inbred strains, our model should have a number of applications including the in vivo study of EGFR targeting for glioma therapy.","['Fenstermaker, R A', 'Capala, J', 'Barth, R F', 'Hujer, A', 'Kung, H J', 'Kaetzel, D M Jr']","['Fenstermaker RA', 'Capala J', 'Barth RF', 'Hujer A', 'Kung HJ', 'Kaetzel DM Jr']","['Neurosurgery Section, Cleveland VAMC, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Glioma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Oct;9 Suppl 1:S106-12.,,,,['CA-43703-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine if other leukemia cells or cell lines also induce similar stimulation, we used different leukemic cell lines and fresh B-cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in bone marrow bioassay. Our results suggest that not all leukemic cells induce BFU-Es. To further identify the leukemia cell derived factor (LDF), A1 cells were lysed and differentially centrifuged to separate plasma membrane protein from cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Only membrane associated protein were shown to induce BFU-E. However, when spent medium was collected and used in the bioassay, it also stimulated BFU-E, suggesting LDFs may be shed from plasma membrane. To further identify LDF, A1 plasma membrane associated proteins were separated by ion-exchange FPLC.

After determining this sequence in six MM patients, patient specific VH oligonucleotide primers from complementarity determining region (CDR) sequences were generated.

Susceptibility to B cell lymphomagenesis.,1940-7,"Prevention of high frequency spontaneous T cell lymphoma development in AKR mice by mAb 18-5 treatment was shown to involve inhibition of the recombinant Class I MCF virus formation and elimination of the early occurring potential lymphoma cells (PLCs). A low B cell lymphoma incidence (16% at a mean latency of 540 days) and a low level of PLCs (yielding 12% B cell lymphoma development following lymphoid cell transfer) was observed in mAb 18-5 treated mice (in contrast to a high PLC level in thymectomized AKR mice that could be experimentally triggered to progress to overt CD5+ B cell lymphomas). Administration of anti CD8 mAb or IL-4 to 12-month-old mAb 18-5 pre-treated mice only slightly increased B cell lymphoma incidence (up to 30-40%). Exposure to split-dose irradiation resulted in 26% B cell lymphomas at a 250 day mean latency. The phenotypes of the B lymphomas developing in mAb 18-5 treated mice were: B220+ (14.8+, 6B2+), 6C3+, Mac2+, CD5-. Most lymphomas expressed l-a and surface IgM, pointing to their mature B cell characteristics. Moreover, in some of the lymphomas, high levels of IgM production and secretion were determined. A comparison of the morphological characteristics (based on light and ultrastructure microscopy) of CD5+ and CD5- B cell lymphomas developing in AKR mice indicated marked differences. Analysis of the IgH locus of representative CD5- B lymphomas showed an identical pattern of IgH rearrangement in some tumors (similar to previous findings among CD5+ lymphomas). The virological analysis of the CD5- B cell lymphomas (similar to those observed in the CD5+ B cell lymphomas of AKR origin) showed that their development did not require formation of the pathogenic MCF recombinant viruses. The differences observed between the CD5+ and CD5- B cell lymphomas developing in AKR mice (following prevention of spontaneous T cell lymphomagenesis) may be due to their origin of different B cell precursors or from B cells at different levels of differentiation.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Peled, A', 'Canaani, E', 'Caspi, Y', 'Haimovich, J', 'Shaft, D', 'Resnitzky, P', 'Brightman, B K', 'Fan, H']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Peled A', 'Canaani E', 'Caspi Y', 'Haimovich J', 'Shaft D', 'Resnitzky P', 'Brightman BK', 'Fan H']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/prevention & control']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1940-7.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BrdUrd-labeling index (BrdUrd-LI) and the duration of S phase (Ts) were calculated from the slope of the regression line obtained by plotting the serial labeling indices against the labeling time. The Ts and potential doubling time (DTpot) of marrow leukemia cells varied from 6.1 to 34.3 h (median 14.3 h) and 1.1 to 20.7 days (median, 7.3 days), respectively. The duration of the total cell cycle time (Tc) which was determined by the Ki-67-derived growth fraction (Ki-67-GF) varied from 14.0 to 112.5 h (median 43.2 h). BrdUrd-LI, DTpot, Ki-67-GF and Tc were significantly correlated with the subtypes (early B-ALL, T/B- ALL and ANLL) of the disease. The median values of LI and GF were much lower in ANLL than in ALL. However, the low proliferative activity of ANLL was not accompanied by a prolonged duration of the total cell cycle time. The longest median duration of Tc was noted in early B-ALL (75.2 h) and the median Tc in ANLL (36.7 h) was close to that in T/B-ALL (34 h).

Moreover, most of these studies have neither specifically focused on adult human BM samples nor have they used combinations to explore specifically the phenotype of myeloid committed CD34+ cells. The aim of the present study has been to characterize the normal human CD34+ precursor cells from adult BM in order to identify missing or extremely rare phenotypes that can be used for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with AML. For this purpose we have utilized the fluorochrome conjugates that provide the most sensitive signals for identifying low antigenic expression, and the technique has been adapted to the characterization of cells present at very low frequencies. Normal human BM samples from 13 adult healthy volunteers have been analyzed using triple stainings at flow cytometry. The mean percentage of CD34+ cells detected was 0.72 +/- 0.33%; these cells displayed an heterogeneous light-scatter distribution. Most CD34+ cells coexpressed CD38 (96.7 +/- 5.7%), HLADR (81.6 +/- 14.0%), CD33 (84.7 +/- 18.3%), CD13 (84.6 +/- 16.2%) and CD71 antigens (65.5 +/- 9.1%). In addition, almost half of CD34+ cells were CD117+ (60 +/- 26.8%).

Reactivity for the CD15 antigen was observed in a small population of CD34+HLADR+ cells (11.6 +/- 11.2%) although its intensity of expression was lower than that of the more mature granulocytic cells. No CD34+ cells displayed CD14, CD65, CD20, strong CD22, CD3 and CD56 antigens. Accordingly, most adult bone marrow CD34+ cells appeared to be committed to the myeloid lineage (CD13+/CD33+) and displayed an intermediate-to-large FSC/SSC while the lymphoid-committed CD34+ cells (CD19+, CD10+) were in a minority with low FSC/SSC values. By triple marker stainings several phenotypes of CD34+ precursor cells were found to be either undetectable or present at very low frequencies (< 1 x 10(-3)) in the normal human adult bone marrow.

Five leukemia cell lines were treated with the in vitro active derivative of dacarbazine: 5-(3-methyl-1-triazeno) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), or with temozolomide (TZM), which is readily cleaved to form the linear triazene MTIC in aqueous solution. The results showed that treatment with TZC at concentrations ranging between 62.5 and 250 microM significantly inhibited cell growth of U-937 and K-562 leukemia cell lines, both with undetectable OGAT activity. Growth inhibition was accompanied by DNA fragmentation and reduction of cell volume characteristic of cell undergoing apoptosis. In contrast, Daudi, HL-60 and Jurkat leukemia cell lines, characterized by high levels of the repair enzyme, were resistant to concentrations of TZC up to 500 microM. Treatment of resistant lines with O6-benzylguanine (BG, a specific inhibitor of OGAT) rendered HL-60 and Daudi but not Jurkat cells sensitive to cytotoxic effects and apoptosis mediated by MTIC. The results presented suggest that: (1) apoptosis is involved in cytotoxic activity of TZC; (2) OGAT could have a role in preventing programmed cell death induced by TZC; and (3) treatment with BG could potentiate cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of TZC on leukemic cell lines when high level of OGAT activity is the main factor involved in resistance to TZC.","['Tentori, L', 'Graziani, G', 'Gilberti, S', 'Lacal, P M', 'Bonmassar, E', ""D'Atri, S""]","['Tentori L', 'Graziani G', 'Gilberti S', 'Lacal PM', 'Bonmassar E', ""D'Atri S""]","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome, Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'PYY6H17XIV (5-(3-methyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/*deficiency/genetics', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1888-95.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transport function was assessed by measuring the modulating effect of the Pgp inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) on the cellular accumulation of daunorubicin, and Pgp antigen expression by surface immunofluorescence using the MRK-16 antibody. Both methods showed a wide range of values for Pgp expression between individual patients, but in contrast to a series of cell lines expressing Pgp there was no correlation between antigen expression and transport function in the clinical samples. As previously reported for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), pretreatment with neuraminidase markedly improved MRK-16 staining in some cases, indicating that abnormal glycosylation can cause epitope masking in AML blasts. Because experience with cell lines shows that Pgp expression is a continuous variable which correlates with the level of drug resistance, rather than the 'positive' or 'negative' which are frequently reported by clinical flow cytometry laboratories, we used a calibration procedure to estimate the actual number of Pgp molecules expressed in the AML samples. Despite the additional refinements of neuraminidase treatment and antigen quantification, the correlation between Pgp antigen expression and daunorubicin accumulation remained extremely weak (r = 0.11; P = 0.63). It is suggested that the assay for transport function can detect molecules that affect daunorubicin accumulation but are antigenically distinct from classical P-glycoprotein. Heterogeneity of multidrug resistance efflux pumps might in part explain the relatively weak prognostic significance of immunofluorescence detection of Pgp in AML patients.","['Xie, X Y', 'Robb, D', 'Chow, S', 'Hedley, D W']","['Xie XY', 'Robb D', 'Chow S', 'Hedley DW']","['Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital/Ontario Cancer Institute, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Biological Transport', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1882-7.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a molar basis, the median sensitivities of the cells to these agents were CLB > CdA > Flu. CLL cells from 90% of the patients had similar relative orders of sensitivities to CdA and Flu, while cells from 10% of the patients showed differential sensitivities to these agents. There was no relationship between the sensitivities of the cells to the nucleoside analogs and sensitivity to CLB. CdA and CLB produced similar toxicities to human marrow progenitor cells in vitro, while Flu was less toxic to these cells. An 18 h exposure to CdA produced significantly greater cell kill of both CLL and marrow progenitor cells than an equivalent 2 h treatment; however, the difference in cytotoxicity was greater for the tumor cells resulting in a higher therapeutic index with the 18 h treatment. The intracellular accumulation of drug varied 5-fold for CdA, with the major metabolite being CdAMP, and 15-fold for Flu, with the major metabolite being F-ara-ATP. However, the accumulation of CdA, Flu or their metabolites did not predict for drug sensitivity. These studies suggest that CdA and Flu cross-resistance cannot be assumed in all CLL patients. The therapeutic effectiveness of CdA may be enhanced by use of a prolonged, low-dose drug regimen.","['Begleiter, A', 'Verburg, L', 'Ashique, A', 'Lee, K', 'Israels, L G', 'Mowat, M R', 'Johnston, J B']","['Begleiter A', 'Verburg L', 'Ashique A', 'Lee K', 'Israels LG', 'Mowat MR', 'Johnston JB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/metabolism/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cladribine/metabolism/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1875-81.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two of the 50 patients (64%) were PGP positive by at least one of the two methods, which gave concordant results in 15 of the 18 cases in which they were both used. No correlation between PGP expression and clinical and hematological parameters including WBC counts, immunophenotype and karyotype was seen, although there was a trend for more frequent CD34 expression in PGP-positive cases. All patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy. We found no difference in complete remission (CR) rate, actuarial disease-free survival and survival in PGP-positive and PGP-negative cases. Our findings suggest that the clinical significance of PGP expression is less clear in ALL than in AML. Wider use of functional techniques of evaluation of mdr1 gene expression, which assess the 'pumping' activity of PGP, and their correlation with quantitative analysis of mdr1 mRNA and protein, would probably improve knowledge of the role of PGP in ALL.

The 4-day MTT assay was successfully performed in 62/73 samples obtained from 53 children with ANLL. We obtained comparable results from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples, and from fresh or cryopreserved samples. In vitro chemosensitivity was not related to clinical features such as sex, age, white blood cell count, or FAB-types. The group of poor responders to chemotherapy was median 3-fold more resistant to Ara-C than the group of good responders, but identification of a threshold for Ara-C sensitivity predictive for individual responses was limited due to the great overlap of in vitro chemosensitivities between both groups. Children with relapsed ANLL were in vitro median 3-fold more resistant to Ara-C than the initial ANLL group. No significant differences for the other drugs were observed with respect to clinical response or disease status.

Taxol and Ara-C mediated apoptosis of CD34+, HLA-DR+ cells, and its inhibition by pIXY321, was not accompanied by any significant alteration in the intracellular p26BCL-2 levels. By demonstrating that co-treatment with pIXY321 confers significant protection against apoptosis of CD34+, HLA-DR+ cells as well as promotes survival of normal HPC exposed to clinically relevant schedules and concentrations of taxol of Ara-C, these results support the design of chemotherapy regimens incorporating pIXY321 plus taxol and/or high-dose Ara-C for solid tumors and/or acute leukemias.

In four of the nine patients with clonal evolution at the IgH locus, the sequence at relapse retained the diversity and joining region (D-N-J) sequences from diagnosis. Patients with clonal evolution were characterized by a higher incidence of more than one IgH PCR band at diagnosis and by late relapse (> 18 months from diagnosis). These results suggest that, where possible, patients with more than one IgH PCR rearrangement at diagnosis should be monitored using another antigen receptor gene, such as TCR gamma, since evolution for this gene was found to be a rare event.

Bcl-2 was found in all types of hematopoietic cell lines which were assigned to the following lineages based on their phenotypical characteristics: pre-B, B, plasma, T, myeloid, monocytic, erythroid-megakaryocytic and Hodgkin's lymphoma derived cell lines. The levels of accumulated mRNA and protein corresponded fairly well in most of the cell lines examined. Our results suggest the notion that bcl-2 expression is widely present in hematopoietic cell lines without restriction to single lineages and, in fact, clearly independent of the chromosomal aberration t(14;18). It is conceivable that bcl-2 expression is a common feature in established hematopoietic cell lines and may contribute to their unlimited growth in vitro.","['Steube, K G', 'Jadau, A', 'Teepe, D', 'Drexler, H G']","['Steube KG', 'Jadau A', 'Teepe D', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen), German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1841-6.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutively 'activating' point mutations of RAS have been detected at high frequency in preleukaemia and acute leukaemia, however, the distribution of expression of p21RAS in normal or preleukaemic primary haematopoietic cells has not been studied. We have examined the expression of p21RAS and its negative regulator/downstream effector, p120GAP, in combination with lineage-specific cluster of differentiation markers in normal and preleukaemic myeloid bone marrow cells using flow cytometry. Normal bone marrow was characterized by low and uniform levels of p21RAS expression throughout all lineages analysed. In contrast, 28% (9/32) of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) over-expressed p21RAS. In three of these patients a single over-expressing peak of p21RAS expression was observed, with no evidence of a population exhibiting expression within the normal range. In 6/32 MDS patients over-expression of p21RAS was observed only in a subpopulation of the myeloid cells. Follow-up samples were analysed in three of these six patients; over-expression was confirmed in each patient and in two patients a relative expansion of the over-expressing cell population was observed. Eight out of nine of the patients with aberrant p21RAS expression were diagnosed with low-risk MDS. From 21 MDS patients screened for p120GAP expression, no reduction or loss of expression was observed, however, one AML patient demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of expression. p120GAP expression was lower (P < 0.05) in the AML group than in normals. The results of the study suggest that over-expression of the RAS gene product, p21RAS, may represent an alternative or additional mechanism of activation of the RAS signalling pathway and that this may play a role in leukaemogenesis, however, there is no evidence from this study that loss of p120GAP expression is a feature of myelodysplasia.","['Gallagher, A', 'Padua, R A', 'al-Sabah, A', 'Hoy, T', 'Burnett, A K', 'Darley, R L']","['Gallagher A', 'Padua RA', 'al-Sabah A', 'Hoy T', 'Burnett AK', 'Darley RL']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1833-40.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in these genes have been responsible for the development of cancer as well as for resistance to cancer therapy. Recently, an emerging family of bcl2-like genes has been identified that plays a role in the regulation of cell death. Its members are highly conserved in several domains which have been shown to be important for homodimerization or heterodimerization. The ratio between BAX/BCL2 heterodimers and BAX/BAX homodimers appears to be pivotal in deciding the life of death of a cell. We recently detected mutations in evolutionary highly conserved domains of the bax gene in cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies. Similar artificially generated mutations in other bcl2-like family members bcl2, bclxl, or ced9 have been shown to alter their function.

Cytogenetic involvement of the myeloid and erythroid cell lineages in MDS with monosomy 7 has been shown before. Lymphoid subpopulations have also been investigated but generally with negative results. A combined technique of May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) for cell cytology and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a chromosome 7 specific DNA probe was applied. Further, immunophenotype and genotype of the cells were simultaneously examined with alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunostaining and FISH. The monosomy 7 was found in the blasts and in all or in subpopulations of myeloid and erythroid cells. T cells (CD3+, CD5+) did not appear to be involved. B cells (CD19+, CD22+) showed a normal distribution of FISH spots in two patients. In one patient however the loss of a chromosome 7 was found in approximately 70% of the cells positive for B cell markers including CD79a. The results of this study show that in some cases MDS is a disease arising in a progenitor cell with repopulative abilities restricted to myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis. In other cases, the pluripotent progenitor cells in MDS may show the capacities to differentiate into B lineage lymphoid cells, as well as suggesting that in those instances MDS represents a condition of more primitive transformed hematopoietic ancestor cells.","['van Lom, K', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Smit, E', 'Hahlen, K', 'Groeneveld, K', 'Lowenberg, B']","['van Lom K', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Smit E', 'Hahlen K', 'Groeneveld K', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Monosomy/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Nov;9(11):1818-21.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we characterize a cell line KOPT-K1 that has a t(11;14)(p13;q11). The breakpoint on chromosome 11 involves an Alu-rich region with the break occurring between two Alu sequences on chromosome 11. In addition, approximately 70 bases from the break on chromosome 11 is a tetranucleotide repeat. Whether either of these structures played a role in the translocation is not known. No heptamer or nonamer sequences, implicated in other rearrangements were found near the breakpoint. The breakpoint on chromosome 11 maps more centromeric than previous translocations of this region. Despite this the RBTN2 gene is highly expressed in KOPT-K1.

Fifteen patients received maintenance therapy consisting of six courses of cytarabine 10 mg/m2, s.c. twice daily, for 14 days. Two complete remitters were allografted and five patients received an ABMT. The median survival of all 50 treated patients was 14 months.

Four patients died during remission-induction therapy, but no patient died as a result of persisting hypoplasia. No fatal complications occurred during the consolidation and maintenance courses. Age and stage of disease had no significant impact on CR rate nor on remission duration. The CR rate was significantly (P = 0.03) higher in patients with only normal metaphases compared to patients with cytogenetic abnormalities. The DFS at 2 years was 33 vs 8%, respectively, for patients without or with cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.02). This study shows that patients below the age of 60 years with poor risk features are candidates for treatment with combination chemotherapy.

We examined the problems of laser flow cytometric analysis to measure the lymphocyte subpopulation and determine the phenotypic expression of hematological malignancies. In lymphocyte subset analysis, no survey has been applied to reveal the accuracy and reproducibility of these tests. We compared the accuracy of gating events and the ratio of lymphocytes using leuco GATE/simul SET analysis to those by manual gate method analysis. We found that there were some patients with SLE in which the accurate lymphocyte subpopulation was difficult to calculate due to the gating of lymphocytes by either method. Furthermore, apparent differences in the lymphocyte population were observed between these methods. In the phenotypic analysis of hematological malignancies, there have been several problems over 30% of the total cells had to be abnormal cells. Second, the malignant cells were difficult to gate unless the information of the size, shape and cellular density were obvious. Third, the phenotype of malignant cells were often different from that of the normal matured cells in the some lineage. However, flow cytometric analysis was useful to determine the cell lineage of peroxidase-negative cells and to diagnose the hybrid leukemia. In summary, the phenotypic analysis using flow cytometry and various monoclonal antibodies are clinically useful tests to diagnose the immunological disorders and hematological malignancies.

These determinants were studied by utilizing amphotropic-ecotropic chimeric envelope proteins that have switched their host range but retain their original fusion domain (TM subunit). Fusion was tested both in rodent cells and in 293 cells bearing the human homolog of the ecotropic MuLV receptor. The results demonstrate that the amphotropic TM is able to mediate cell-to-cell fusion to an extent equivalent to that mediated by the ecotropic TM, indicating that their fusion domains are equivalent. The ""murinized"" human homolog of the ecotropic receptor supports syncytium formation as well as the native murine receptor. These findings suggest that interactions between the ecotropic envelope protein and conserved sequences in the ecotropic receptor are the principal determinants of syncytium formation. The relationship of the fusion phenotype to pH-dependent infection and the route of viral entry was examined by studying virions bearing the chimeric envelope proteins. Such virions appear to enter cells via a pathway that is directed by the host range-determining region of their envelope rather than by sequences that confer pH dependence. Therefore, the pH dependence of infection may not reflect the initial steps in viral entry. Thus, it appears that both the syncytium phenotype and the route of viral entry are properties of the viral receptor, the amino-terminal half of the ecotropic envelope protein, or the interaction between the two.","['Ragheb, J A', 'Yu, H', 'Hofmann, T', 'Anderson, W F']","['Ragheb JA', 'Yu H', 'Hofmann T', 'Anderson WF']","['Molecular Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Giant Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.11.7205-7215.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Nov;69(11):7205-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.11.7205-7215.1995.,,11,,,PMC189642,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro neutralization assays demonstrated that anti-Env antibodies gave different degrees of neutralization, while no anti-Gag neutralized the virus.

As expected, different anti-Env antibodies demonstrated different degrees of protection which correlated with their neutralizing abilities. Surprisingly, anti-Gag antibodies directed against both p15 (MA protein) and p30 (CA protein) were also protective, significantly delaying the onset of disease. No protection was seen with either of two control antibodies. The protection with anti-Gag was dose related and time dependent and was also produced with Fab fragments. Treatment with anti-Gag did not prevent viremia but resulted in a slight slowing in viremia kinetics and decreased levels of virus in the central nervous systems of mice protected from disease.

Analysis of the LTR region reveals a potential internal promoter element for RNA polymerase III transcription within the U3 region. Studies with polymerase inhibitors suggest that this LTR transcript, designated let (LTR-encoded trans activator), is a product of RNA polymerase III. The mechanisms whereby RNA leukemia viruses cause lymphoid neoplasia after a long latent period have been extensively studied but are only partially understood. The region of the LTR identified here as being important in trans activation has recently been shown to be a critical determinant of the leukemogenicity and latency of Moloney murine leukemia virus. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of retrovirus-induced activation of cellular gene expression, potentially contributing to leukemogenesis.","['Choi, S Y', 'Faller, D V']","['Choi SY', 'Faller DV']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase III/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Latency']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.11.7054-7060.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Nov;69(11):7054-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.11.7054-7060.1995.,,11,,['CA65420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC189625,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine whether NO inhibits murine Friend leukemia virus (FV) replication in vitro and to what extent NO may play a role in defenses against FV infection in mice. Three NO-generating compounds were studied: 3-morpholino-sydononimine (SIN-1), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). The effects of these three compounds were compared with those of their controls (SIN-1C, potassium ferricyanide, and N-acetylpenicillamine, respectively), which do not generate NO and with that of sodium nitrite (NaNO2). SIN-1, SNP, and SNAP inhibited FV replication in dunni cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no significant inhibitory effect was observed with the three controls or NaNO2. Furthermore, the addition of superoxide dismutase did not alter the inhibitory effect of SIN-1, which is also known to generate superoxide anions. No dunni cell toxicity was observed in the range of concentrations tested. We also assessed the effect of NO produced by activated macrophages on FV replication. Macrophages activated by gamma interferon and lipopolysaccharide inhibited FV replication in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition was due in part to NO production, since it was reversed by NG-monomethyl L-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase. In vivo administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase, significantly increased the viral load in spleen cells of FV-infected mice. These results suggested that NO may play a role in defenses against the murine Friend leukemia retrovirus.","['Akarid, K', 'Sinet, M', 'Desforges, B', 'Gougerot-Pocidalo, M A']","['Akarid K', 'Sinet M', 'Desforges B', 'Gougerot-Pocidalo MA']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U13, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '2149-70-4 (Nitroarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '5O5U71P6VQ (linsidomine)', '79032-48-7 (S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'D46583G77X (Molsidomine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)', 'M0KG633D4F (Sodium Nitrite)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects/physiology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molsidomine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Nitric Oxide/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitroarginine', 'Nitroprusside/*pharmacology', 'Penicillamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine', 'Sodium Nitrite/pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.11.7001-7005.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Nov;69(11):7001-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.11.7001-7005.1995.,,11,,,PMC189619,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genealogical analysis suggested mainly a mother-to-offspring transmission of this STLV-1. Three long-term T-cell lines, established from peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from three STLV-1-seropositive monkeys, produced HTLV-1 Gag and Env antigens and retroviral particles. The first complete nucleotide sequence of an STLV-1 (9,025 bp), obtained for one of these isolates, indicated an overall genetic organization similar to that of HTLV-1 but with a nucleotide variability for the structural genes ranging from 7.8 to 13.1% compared with the HTLV-1 ATK and STLV-1 PTM3 Asian prototypes. The Tax and Rex regulatory proteins were well conserved, while the pX region, known to encode new proteins in HTLV-1 (open reading frames I and II), was more divergent than that in the ATK strain. Furthermore, a fragment of 522 bp of the gp21 env gene from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNAs from five of the STLV-1-infected monkeys was sequenced. Phylogenetic trees constructed with the long terminal repeat and env (gp46 and gp21) regions demonstrated that this new STLV-1 occupies a unique position within the Asian STLV-1 and HTLV-1 isolates, being, by most analyses, related more to the Australo-Melanesian HTLV-1 topotype than to any other Asian STLV-1. These data raise new hypotheses on the possible interspecies viral transmission between monkeys carrying STLV-1 and early Australoid settlers, ancestors of the present day Australo-Melanesian inhabitants, during their migrations from the Southeast Asian land mass to the greater Australian continent.","['Ibrahim, F', 'de The, G', 'Gessain, A']","['Ibrahim F', 'de The G', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Australia', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*virology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Products, rex/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Macaca/genetics/*virology', 'Male', 'Melanesia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree', '*Phylogeny', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'TATA Box']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.11.6980-6993.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Nov;69(11):6980-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.11.6980-6993.1995.,,11,,,PMC189617,,"['GENBANK/Z46895', 'GENBANK/Z46896', 'GENBANK/Z46897', 'GENBANK/Z46898', 'GENBANK/Z46899', 'GENBANK/Z46900']",,,,,,,,,,

Decreased expression of Gag and Env appears to be due, in part, to intragenic RNA sequences, termed cis-acting repressive sequences (CRS), and may be mediated by binding of specific cellular factors. We demonstrated previously that two cellular proteins, p60CRS and p40CRS, interact with HTLV type 2.5' long terminal repeat CRS RNA and that the interaction of both proteins with CRS RNA correlates with function (A. C. Black, C. T. Ruland, J. Luo, A. Bakker, J. K. Fraser, and J. D. Rosenblatt, Virology 200:29-41, 1994). By radioimmunoprecipitation of HeLa nuclear proteins UV cross-linked to CRS RNAs with murine monoclonal antibodies, we now show that p40CRS is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and p60CRS is polypyrimidine tract-binding protein or hnRNP I. These immunoprecipitation results were confirmed by an immunobinding assay with hnRNP I and hnRNP AI antibodies and by cross-competition electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. In addition, we mapped a putative hnRNP A1 binding site in U5 RNA and demonstrated that p40CRS (hnRNP A1) binding to that site correlates with CRS function. Since both hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 have been shown to influence splicing and potentially other steps in RNA processing, the binding of both hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 to HTLV RNA regulatory elements may alter retrovirus RNA processing and may be involved in regulation by Rex.","['Black, A C', 'Luo, J', 'Watanabe, C', 'Chun, S', 'Bakker, A', 'Fraser, J K', 'Morgan, J P', 'Rosenblatt, J D']","['Black AC', 'Luo J', 'Watanabe C', 'Chun S', 'Bakker A', 'Fraser JK', 'Morgan JP', 'Rosenblatt JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Los Angeles 90095-1678, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (hnRNPA1 protein, human)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1', '*Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.11.6852-6858.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Nov;69(11):6852-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.11.6852-6858.1995.,,11,,"['CA53632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 CA01566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA61545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC189599,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated that the infiltration and growth of leukaemic lymphoblasts in the testis are influenced by the same endocrine and paracrine control systems that regulate normal testicular function. In the present study the effects of aqueous extracts of scrotal, abdominal and estrogen-treated postpubertal rat testes on rat-leukaemic lymphoblast proliferation were evaluated. The effects of recombinant cytokines analogous to those observed in the testis on leukaemic cell DNA-synthesis were also evaluated since changes in the levels of these factors have been observed in association with cryptorchidism and low levels of gonadotropins. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukaemic rat lymphoblasts after 24 h of culture, whereas TGF-beta 2, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-6 or combinations of them were inactive. Extracts of estrogen-treated testes and abdominal testes of unilaterally cryptorchid animals inhibited leukaemic T-cell proliferation significantly more than extracts of normal testes. The inhibitory activity in abdominal testes could be neutralized by anti-TGF-beta 1 antibodies. These results suggest that testicular TGF-beta 1 may influence growth of leukaemic lymphoblasts in the testis but also that other as yet unknown, testicular factors are involved in the regulation of leukaemic cell function in the testis.","['Jahnukainen, K', 'Attermo, P', 'Saari, T', 'Salmi, T T', 'von Euler, M', 'Pollanen, P', 'Soder, O']","['Jahnukainen K', 'Attermo P', 'Saari T', 'Salmi TT', 'von Euler M', 'Pollanen P', 'Soder O']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)']",IM,"['Abdomen', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cryptorchidism/immunology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Scrotum', 'Temperature', 'Testis/*chemistry/physiology', 'Testosterone/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['016503789500926C [pii]', '10.1016/0165-0378(95)00926-c [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 1995 Mar;28(3):263-73. doi: 10.1016/0165-0378(95)00926-c.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the immediate-early phase of IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation. To determine the lineage of cells that showed the immediate response to irradiation, normal spleen cells were analyzed by Northern blotting and in situ hybridization after separation by magnetic antibodies against specific cell-surface antigens. Although most of the spleen macrophages continuously expressed a low level of IL-1 beta mRNA, a portion of the macrophage population transiently accumulated large amounts of IL-1 beta message immediately after irradiation. A macrophage-like leukemia cell line that resembles these inducible macrophages was identified. A similar immediate-early and transient increase in the IL-1 beta mRNA level occurred when cultured spleen cells were irradiated with a low dose (3 Gy) of x rays. In contrast, the x ray-inducible expression of the IL-1 beta gene was immediate and continuous, not transient, in spleen cells from whole-body irradiated mice. Results of the run-on transcription assay and the determination of the decrease in the message using cultured spleen and macrophage-like leukemia cells indicated that x ray irradiation appears to activate the transcription of the IL-1 beta gene and partially stabilize the message. The results show that the x ray-induced immediate-early accumulation of IL-1 beta mRNA is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in an as yet unidentified population of spleen macrophages.","['Ishihara, H', 'Tanaka, I', 'Nemoto, K', 'Tsuneoka, K', 'Cheeramakara, C', 'Yoshida, K', 'Ohtsu, H']","['Ishihara H', 'Tanaka I', 'Nemoto K', 'Tsuneoka K', 'Cheeramakara C', 'Yoshida K', 'Ohtsu H']","['Division of Chemical Pharmacology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba-shi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Spleen/*cytology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'X-Rays']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1269/jrr.36.112 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1995 Jun;36(2):112-24. doi: 10.1269/jrr.36.112.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the peculiar immunophenotypic markers is the strong expression of the p55 chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R), recognized by anti-CD25 (or anti-Tac) monoclonal antibody. However, it is known that in rare cases CD25 may not be detectable, even when variant forms of HCL are excluded. The possibility has not been investigated that in these situations CD25 is present in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells. This paper describes a case in which the clinical, histological, and electron microscopic features were consistent with a typical HCL. Immunophenotype analysis showed the whole spectrum of markers of HCL, except for the expression of IL2R. The soluble form of the molecule was, however, increased in the patient's serum. Cytospin staining of the neoplastic B cells with anti-CD25 clearly demonstrated the presence of IL2R in the cytoplasm of hairy cells. When the cells were cultivated in vitro in the presence of interferon-alpha 2b, CD25 was detectable at the membrane level.

Therefore, it is usually essential to perform several types of experiments and analyse all the results in terms of a mathematical model, the use of which is not limited a priori by a specified application. In the present study we investigated cell population kinetics using rat chloroleukaemia cells propagated in suspension culture in vitro. The parameters were measured: doubling time of the population, fraction of labelled mitoses, changes in labelling index with time after pulse labelling, continuous labelling and stathmokinetic index. Analysis of the results was based on a computer program CECAM, which is a stochastic model capable of simulating essentially all types of kinetic experiments based on presently known assay techniques. The results showed that precise and reliable information on cell population kinetics could not be obtained from the analysis of any single type of experimental data. In particular, the technique of labelled mitoses underestimated the duration of the G1 phase, owing to subtle label-induced changes in population behaviour. These changes could not have been detected with any certainty without rigorous quantitative comparisons with other types of experimental data. As a whole, however, results obtained by the different techniques were in agreement and the kinetic behaviour of chloroleukaemia cells in vitro could be established in detail. In certain circumstances even minute changes in the kinetic parameters of the cells can modify population behaviour drastically. To study these cases adequately the experiments must be designed with utmost care, preferably with the aid of preceding simulations. This is because demonstration of small primary changes in population kinetics may be beyond the limit of detection of any single assay method.","['Toivonen, H', 'Foa, P', 'Paile, W', 'Rytomaa, T']","['Toivonen H', 'Foa P', 'Paile W', 'Rytomaa T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology', 'Computers', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Stochastic Processes']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1981.tb00506.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1981 Jan;14(1):9-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1981.tb00506.x.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For development of resistance the single maximum tolerated doses of CPA or L-PAM were used, each for two sublines in the four tumors. In W256 after only one to five treatment generations, all sublines were resistant, whereas only by generation 10 had R3/CPA, R3/L-PAM, and L1210/CPA reached marked resistance, and L1210/L-PAM reached moderate resistance. All four Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma sublines were essentially still as sensitive as the parent tumor. Long-established resistant sublines from previous studies (greater than 20 treatment generations) were used for cross-resistance, chromosome, and stability studies. All W256-resistant sublines were cross-resistant to CPA, L-PAM, and thiotepa; but the sublines of the other tumors, although showing marked, or in the case of L1210/CPA, complete resistance to their respective inducing agents, retained moderate-to-full sensitivity to the other alkylators. W256/CPA and W256/L-PAM were mainly polyploid (greater than 80% of cells), whereas the other tumors were mainly diploid or near diploid. During 10 to 20 untreated generations the degree of drug resistance remained unchanged in W256 and L1210 lines, but was reduced in R3 and Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma lines. The resistance pattern of W256 appears to be compatible with a simple selection mechanism, whereas those of the three other tumors suggest involvement of multiple determinants. This study suggests that some, but not all, tumors have universal cross-resistance between different types of alkylating agents.","['Schmid, F A', 'Otter, G M', 'Stock, C C']","['Schmid FA', 'Otter GM', 'Stock CC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma 256, Walker/*drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Melphalan/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rats']",1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Mar;40(3):830-3.,,3,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analog is known to substitute for arginine in protein biosynthesis in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Previous studies with cells grown in vitro indicated that canavanine caused a marked inhibition of DNA synthesis and viability. The system used in the present study was C57BL/6 x DBA/2 F mice bearing L1210 leukemic cells. Following an i.v. injection of 10 mg canavanine, the t1/2 beta of canavanine in the serum was estimated at 16 min. This finding suggested that frequent injections of high doses of canavanine would be required for an effect on tumor cell proliferation. DNA synthesis by the L1210 cells, assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation, fell to 9% of the control value after 12 hourly i.p. injections of canavanine (20 mg each). A constant s.c. infusion of 20 mg/hr for 24 hr caused an 86% inhibition of DNA synthesis. The antitumor activity of canavanine was tested against L1210, using a 24-hr infusion schedule with treatment starting 24 hr after i.p. inoculation of 10(5) cells. An optimal dose of 18 g/kg body weight produced a median increased lifespan of 44% (p less than 0.005). These results suggest that L-canavanine may be useful as an antitumor agent.","['Green, M H', 'Brooks, T L', 'Mendelsohn, J', 'Howell, S B']","['Green MH', 'Brooks TL', 'Mendelsohn J', 'Howell SB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Canavanine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice']",1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Mar;40(3):535-7.,,3,,"['CA 11971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using autoradiographic techniques, increases in the percentage of labeling of red blood cells were found in blood smears taken at different time intervals after pulse labeling of the erythroid precursor cells. The total reticulocyte production per unit time is more than 2.8-fold in Rauscher murine leukemia virus-infected mice as compared with that in uninfected mice. The life span of the newly formed cells was measured after [51Cr]chromate labeling of transfused erythrocytes in infected and in control mice. The life span was indicated by time that one-half of the labeled erythrocytes disappeared (t1/2) was reduced to one-quarter of that of erythrocytes of uninfected mice. The functioning of the newly formed cells was analyzed by measuring the glucose utilization versus lactate production and by measuring the activities of a number of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. Comparison of glucose metabolism in normal and leukemic mice and in mice recovering from artificially induced anemia revealed that the metabolic activity of erythrocytes from leukemic mice corresponds to the activity of young erythrocyte populations. The increased reticulocyte production is, apparently, a result of the degree of anemia in infected animals. This anemia is not compensated for, however, since the loss of erythrocytes surpasses the flux of new red blood cells from the hematopoietic organs into the peripheral blood.","['de Both, N J', 'Kwak, E', 'Klootwijk-van Dijke, E']","['de Both NJ', 'Kwak E', 'Klootwijk-van Dijke E']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Volume', '*Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Hexokinase/blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Rauscher Virus']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Nov;40(11):4270-5.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These derivatives spontaneously hydrolyze under physiological conditions to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, the active metabolite of cyclophosphamide. The two derivatives were compared with phosphoramide mustard, the presumed alkylating species generated by 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide decomposition, for cytotoxic and DNA cross-linking actions. The three compounds yielded colony survival curves that were similar in shape, but the sulfido derivatives were 4 or 5 times as potent as was phosphoramide mustard. All three compounds produced DNA-protein cross-links as well as interstrand cross-links as measured by alkaline elution. The time course of cross-link formation and removal for the three compounds was similar. The sulfido compounds, however, were 4 to 5 times as potent as was the phosphoramide mustard in the formation of interstrand cross-links, in agreement with the cytotoxicity findings. The higher potency of the sulfido compounds was not attributable to the generation of acrolein. These findings indicate that sulfido derivatives of CP can act directly (without metabolic activation) on cells, probably through spontaneous stepwise conversion to phosphoramide mustard, the presumed proximal alkylating agent. The cell-killing effect may be mediated by phosphoramide mustard-induced DNA interstrand cross-linking. Sulfidocyclophosphamide CP derivatives appear to be suitable for in vitro studies of the mechanism of action of CP. Sulfidocyclophosphamide CP derivatives may also have therapeutic potential as CP-like drugs that do not require metabolic activation.","['Erickson, L C', 'Ramonas, L M', 'Zaharko, D S', 'Kohn, K W']","['Erickson LC', 'Ramonas LM', 'Zaharko DS', 'Kohn KW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '70396-85-9 (4-S-(hexane-6-ol)sulfidocyclophosphamide)', '70396-87-1 (4-S-(propionic acid)sulfidocyclophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Nov;40(11):4216-20.,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At various days thereafter, two to three mice from each group were sacrificed to determine spleen weight, cellularity, and NK cell activity versus YAC-1 lymphoma cells. The CP from the Pasteur Institute augmented NK cell activity 3 days following injections; however, the activity returned to normal by Day 7 and remained at that level. On the other hand, strain 5888 did not cause as great an increase in lytic activity as did the Pasteur Institute CP at Day 3; but by Day 10 after injection, NK cell levels were above control, and they remained elevated through Day 21. Both the heat-killed and formalin-killed preparations of strain 6134 stimulated NK cell activity initially but resulted in a loss of activity at the later times tested. Experiments done with different doses and routes of injection yielded similar results.

In vitro irradiation of leukaemic ascites cells by X- or gamma-rays and subsequent inoculation in mice showed that optimum immunogenicity is radiation dose-dependent. Grafting mice with 10(7) leukaemic ascites cells irradiated at optimum dose (80 GyX- or gamma-rays) delays mortality of the animals when challenged later with untreated L1210 cells, but is unable to cure mice. By contrast, specific immunoprophylaxis induced by Micrococcus, complement-triggering polysaccharides or BCG and irradiated leukaemic cells was able to protect mice against grafts of 10(4) L1210 cells. The i.p. route was notably superior to the i.v. route. When mice bearing advanced L1210 tumour were treated by chemotherapy (12 mg/kg of BCNU) on Day 6.5 after grafting 10(4) L1210 cells and subsequently treated by immunotherapy, a very high percentage (up to 90%) of mice with 10(8) leukaemic cells could be cured by repeated 1mg injections of bacterium or polysaccharide, and challenge with irradiated leukaemic cells was unnecessary. Because of the high cure rate obtained, the very regular response pattern and the non-pathogenicity, the bacterium Micrococcus lysodeikticus would seem a promising new candidate for chemo-immunotherapeutic antitumour strategies.","['Verloes, R', 'Atassi, G', 'Dumont, P', 'Kanarek, L']","['Verloes R', 'Atassi G', 'Dumont P', 'Kanarek L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'BCG Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Micrococcus/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1981.29 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1981 Feb;43(2):201-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1981.29.,,2,,['N01-CM-53840/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2010509,,,,,,,,,,,,

To avoid emotional, infectious and financial burdens of hospitalization, efforts have been successful in developing ambulatory outpatient programs within specialized centers. Although infection control policies have been reasonably well-established for the hospitalized inpatient, policies for the hospital outpatient are lacking. Investigations into the problems of ""nosocomial outpatient infections"" are needed. Accomplishments in recent years in the control of nosocomial infections include the development of preparations for passive immunization for varicella-zoster virus and hepatitis B virus exposures and the application of certain antibiotic regimens for prophylaxis.

We reviewed clinical and pathologic features of the 181 patients with leukemia who were examined at autopsy at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in the past 12 years, 93 (51 percent) of whom had received intravenous Ara-C in doses of 7.5 to 30 mg/kg/day (average dose, 16 mg/kg/day). Fifty-one patients had received their last treatment within 30 days, and 42 patients between 31 and 894 days, prior to death. Among the 181 patients examined at autopsy 43 (24 percent) had massive edema, 59 (33 percent) had moderate edema, and 79 (44 percent) had either slight edema or no pulmonary edema. The 51 patients who had received Ara-C within 30 days of their death, compared to the other 130, had a highly significant increase in the frequency of pulmonary edema (p less than 0.001), which was massive in 24 and moderate in 18. In these 42 patients, causative or contributing factors that explained the edema were present in 14 (33 percent) of them, but in 28 (67 percent) there was no apparent explanation.

The unexplained pulmonary edema, a highly proteinaceous interstitial and intra-alveolar infiltrate, correlated with gastrointestinal lesions typical of Ara-C toxicity (p less than 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that unexplained pulmonary edema was predicted by the recent administration of Ara-C, but by no other chemotherapeutic agent, including daunomycin, a potential cardiotoxin frequently given in conjunction with Ara-C. The study suggests that increased alveolar capillary permeability may result from the intravenous administration of cytosine arabinoside and that this complication should be considered when pulmonary edema develops in leukemic patients treated with Ara-C.","['Haupt, H M', 'Hutchins, G M', 'Moore, G W']","['Haupt HM', 'Hutchins GM', 'Moore GW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Edema/*chemically induced/diagnosis/pathology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(81)90759-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(81)90759-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1981 Feb;70(2):256-61. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(81)90759-2.,,2,,"['HL-14153/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-17655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'LM-03651/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality from LL is generally low. Effects of LL virus (LLV) on production and mortality were investigated in approximately 2000 Leghorn pullets in each of two consecutive years. The pullets were from nine strains developed in Ottawa, of which three were unselected control strains and six were strains under selection for up to 27 generations for high egg production and a complex of related commercially important traits. The overall frequency of birds shedding LL virus of gs antigen into eggs (LL-S) was significantly lower in the selected strains (3.9%) than in the control strains (18.5%), indicating that LLV may have negative effects on production and cause elimination of LL-S birds by selection. Such significant effects were indeed detected: the LL-S pullets produced to 497 days of age in 1976 and 1977, respectively, 30 and 25 eggs less per hen-housed than the nonshedders. The LL-S birds matured sexually later, produced smaller eggs at a lower rate, and their eggs had a lower specific gravity, indicating thinner shells. Mortality from all causes to 497 days was significantly higher in LL-S birds (+14.8%) in 1976. In 1977 the increase (+5.5%) did not reach statistical significance. In both years the mortality from LL itself remained very low. In another study, eggs from one of the control strains were incubated and hatched from the dams were 291 and 483 days old. The eggs from LL-S dams had 2.4% lower fertility and 12.4% lower hatchability. The effects on hatchability were more pronounced in the older dams. Since the lower production of LL-S birds results in a lower frequency of such birds in strains selected for high egg production, it is suggested that a part of the difference between the performance of the selected and control strains (delta S) is due to reduction in the frequency of LL-S birds (delta L) rather than due to true genetic gain. In this study, the size of delta L relative to delta S was estimated at 4 to 14% for egg production and 3 to 7% for egg weight. The negative effects of LLV infection on egg production, mortality, hatchability, and genetic gains show the desirability of producing chickens free of LLV infection.","['Gavora, J S', 'Spencer, J L', 'Gowe, R S', 'Harris, D L']","['Gavora JS', 'Spencer JL', 'Gowe RS', 'Harris DL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/economics/microbiology/*mortality', '*Chickens/physiology', 'Fertility', 'Oncogenic Viruses', 'Poultry Diseases/economics/*mortality']",1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.3382/ps.0592165 [doi]', 'S0032-5791(19)34822-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 1980 Oct;59(10):2165-78. doi: 10.3382/ps.0592165.,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum solubilization of chromatin was unique for each of the three cell types: the least malignant (our Stage II) released 61% of its chromatin DNA, the most malignant (Stage IV), 46%, and the intermediate (Stage III) released 36%. An analysis of the nucleosome oligomers liberated by digestion also demonstrated differences. After 15 minutes of digestion when release was reaching its maximum, a greater proportion of large nucleosomal oligomers (sizes > trinucleosome) was released from Stage II nuclei than from Stage III or IV nuclei. The cell types also differed in the relative amount of H1-depleted mononucleosomes released. Analysis of the size of the double-stranded DNA associated with mononucleosomal particles showed that Stage III mononucleosomes were smaller (148 bp) than Stage IV (167 bp) or Stage II (190 bp). In addition, while the DNA of mononucleosomes depleted in H1 was smaller than that in the H1-containing species, relative size differences among the different cell types were retained. These data suggested that the difference in the mononuocleosome particle size resistant to nuclease digestion was independent of histone H1. Differences in nucleosome repeat length were also noted among the cell types. These studies have demonstrated dramatic differences in chromatin structure associated with malignant potential of an otherwise morphologically identical cell type. These findings may reflect changes in the relative amounts of H2a variants which we have previously described among the different malignant cell types.","['Leonardson, K E', 'Levy, S B']","['Leonardson KE', 'Levy SB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Histones/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleosomes/ultrastructure', 'Solubility']",1980/11/25 00:00,1980/11/25 00:01,['1980/11/25 00:00'],"['1980/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/8.22.5317 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1980 Nov 25;8(22):5317-31. doi: 10.1093/nar/8.22.5317.,,22,,"['CA-24530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM25792/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC324304,,,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise, only a 50 component is observed when the polypeptide that binds IgE is isolated by affinity chromatography in conditions which prevent aggregation of the IgE, even when intrinsically labelled R epsilon is studied. To determine how R epsilon is inserted into the plasma membrane, we reacted RBL cells with the photolysable hydrophobic reagent 5-iodonaphthyl-1-azide (INA), which preferentially labels the intramembranous segments of several intrinsic membrane proteins. We report here that, surprisingly, the label was found, not on the 50 K glycopeptide, but only on a 30 K component which other studies suggest is a subunit of R epsilon (ref 9, 12).","['Holowka, D', 'Gitler, C', 'Bercovici, T', 'Metzger, H']","['Holowka D', 'Gitler C', 'Bercovici T', 'Metzger H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '63785-44-4 (iodonaphthylazide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Azides', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Weight', '*Naphthalenes', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",1981/02/26 00:00,1981/02/26 00:01,['1981/02/26 00:00'],"['1981/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/289806a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1981 Feb 26;289(5800):806-8. doi: 10.1038/289806a0.,,5800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also presented is the evidence for an increased incidence of malignancies associated with CLL and LL and the complicating factors introduced when reticuloendothelial malignancies occur simultaneously with head and neck neoplasms.","['Strauss, M', 'Sharkey, F E']","['Strauss M', 'Sharkey FE']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Carotid Body Tumor/pathology', 'Dysgerminoma/pathology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*pathology/secondary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/pathology']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1288/00005537-198103000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Laryngoscope. 1981 Mar;91(3):432-8. doi: 10.1288/00005537-198103000-00014.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, no clear exposure-risk relationship could be demonstrated. It is likely that there has been an increased risk of cancer since the elimination of alpha- and beta-naphthylamine by 1950.

Ara-G inhibits the cell proliferation at an ED50 concentration of 12.3 microM. The cells die because of unbalanced growth. At cytostatic concentrations ara-G inhibits the incorporation rate of dThd into DNA to a much higher degree compared to those of the precursors into RNA or proteins. Ara-G has no effect on the induction of DNA polymerase alpha occurring at the beginning of the S-phase; this compound exerts its inhibitory activity during the S-phase. Ara-G is intracellularly phosphorylated to ara-GTP. It was demonstrated that ara-G is incorporated into DNA but not into RNA; one molecule of ara-G is incorporated per 7050 molecules of deoxyguanosine. The ara-GMP moieties, incorporated into DNA of L5178y cells are not removed during a culture period of 7.7 doubling steps; compared to the controls no reduction of the viability and growth rate was observed.","['Muller, W E', 'Geurtsen, W', 'Beyer, R', 'Schuster, D K', 'Zahn, R K', 'Arendes, J']","['Muller WE', 'Geurtsen W', 'Beyer R', 'Schuster DK', 'Zahn RK', 'Arendes J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis']",1981/03/15 00:00,1981/03/15 00:01,['1981/03/15 00:00'],"['1981/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(81)90102-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(81)90102-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1981 Mar 15;34(3):301-13. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(81)90102-2.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antitumor activity of CDP-diacylglycerol analogs containing the cytosine arabinoside moiety.,619-31,"Among events limiting the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy are the general lack of preferential uptake of anticancer drugs by tumor cells and the occurrence of drug resistance. An approach has been undertaken to explore whether or not such events can be favorably altered or circumvented therapeutically by development of a new class of anticancer molecules, cytotoxic liponucleotide analogs. The design of cytotoxic liponucleotide analogs encompasses both biochemical and biophysical aspects of liponucleotide and glycerophospholipid structure and metabolism. Several cytotoxic liponucleotide analogs of cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDPdiacylglycerol/dCDPdiacylglycerol), containing the 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl moiety, were tested for antitumor activity. Multispecies ara-CDPdiacylglycerol (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-diphosphate diacylglycerol), which contains egg lecithin-derived mixed fatty acyl chains, was more active than 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), a clinically used anticancer drug, against leukemia L5178Y and P388 ascites cells in mice. At identical single doses (50 mg/kg per day times 4) administered intraperitoneally, ara-CDPdiacylglycerol prolonged the life spans of L5178Y tumor-bearing mice 93%, while ara-C prolonged life by 18%. Ara-CDPdiacylglycerol increased life spans of P388 tumor-bearing mice by 357% at doses of 50 mg/kg per day times 4; the maximum increase with ara-C was 159% (85 mg/kg per day times 4). Against a P388 ara-C-resistant cell line (P/Ara-C, kinase deficient) in mice, ara-CDPdiacylglycerol prolonged survival times by 34% at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day times 4 and by 55% at 75 mg/kg per day times 4; the drug was not active against two other ara-C-resistant murine leukemia mutants (CA 55, CA5b). With cell line-derived human colon carcinoma HCT-15 grown in mice immunosuppressed with anti-thymocyte serum, ara-CDPdiacylglycerol at a single daily dose of 50 mg/kg per day times 4 significantly reduced tumor weights to 21% of the controls; the same dose schedule of ara-C caused no observable reduction of tumor weights. Results of these preliminary antitumor evaluations indicate that cytotoxic liponucleotide analogs should be investigated further to determine their potential as antineoplastic molecules.","['Turcotte, J G', 'Srivastava, S P', 'Steim, J M', 'Calabresi, P', 'Tibbetts, L M', 'Chu, M Y']","['Turcotte JG', 'Srivastava SP', 'Steim JM', 'Calabresi P', 'Tibbetts LM', 'Chu MY']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytidine Diphosphate Diglycerides)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Diphosphate Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*pharmacology']",1980/09/08 00:00,1980/09/08 00:01,['1980/09/08 00:00'],"['1980/09/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/08 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(80)90111-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(80)90111-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Sep 8;619(3):619-31. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(80)90111-3.,,3,,"['CA 13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no overall excess of deaths from leukaemia when compared with the expectation from national rates. There was also no excess of cytological types of leukaemia which have been shown to be particularly associated with benzene exposure. However, the risk for those men with medium or high exposure relative to the risk for those with low benzene exposure approached a significance (P=0.05) when length of service was taken into account.

Patients in the good-prognosis group had a BUC less than or equal to 8 mM. [Hb] greater than or equal to 100 g/l, and no or minimal symptoms. Those in the poor-prognosis group had either [Hb] less than or equal to 75 g/l or a BUC greater than 10 mM and restricted clinical activity.

Although a marked decrease in haematocrit was observed in mice given L1210 by either route, the anaemia was most pronounced after the i.p. route. The leucocyte count was more markedly increased after i.v. inoculation than after i.p. inoculation. The number of platelets decreased following either route, but was more depressed by i.v. inoculation. When mice were treated with VM-26 on Day 4 and i.p. inoculation of 10(6) L1210 cells, the haematological responses were altered. VM-26 prevented the accumulation of haemorrhagic ascites fluid and the precipitous decline in haemotacrit. However, the number of leucocytes increased dramatically, most significantly during the 48 h before death. VM-26 caused a temporary restoration of platelet count to near baseline levels. By the time of death, however, a second decrease in platelets had occurred. The results suggest that the haematological response of mice to L1210 leukaemic cells varies according to the route of inoculation, and that these tumour-induced haematological responses of the host can be modified by treatment with VM-26.","['Hacker, M', 'Roberts, D', 'Jackson, C W']","['Hacker M', 'Roberts D', 'Jackson CW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Leukemia L1210/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Platelet Count', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Teniposide/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1980.304 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1980 Nov;42(5):697-702. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1980.304.,,5,,"['CA 05176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 08480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12732/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2010556,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 16 patients who had preleukemic syndromes included those with refractory sideroblastic and megaloblastic anemia (with or without an excess of blasts), idiopathic pancytopenia or pure erythrocytic aplasia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, idiopathic refractory neutropenia, agranulocytosis or thrombocytopenia, and persistent eosinophilia. Five of the seven patients who had acute leukemia had nonlymphoblastic leukemia; two had blastic crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia. Of the 13 patients who had lymphoproliferative disorders, eight had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, three had macroglobulinemia, and two had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Three patients who had chronic renal failure associated with severe anemia and two who had chronic liver disease, splenomegaly, or hypersplenism were also encountered. In this study there appeared to be a consistent relationship between the presence of increased numbers of mast cells and the lymphocyte and plasma cell counts in the bone marrow.

The highest levels of radioactivity were found in the gallbladder followed by the tumor, spleen and liver, respectively. 24 h after drug administration the tumor contains 5.8% of the radioactivity detected in the tumor 1 h after drug administration. The tumor thus does not retain the alkaloid for a long period of time. At subcellular level tubulin was found to bind the highest amount of the alkaloid, followed by the fraction containing Golgi and plasma membranes. P388 tumor sensitive to vincristine (VCR) and formyl-leurosine (F-leu) incorporates three times more VCR and four times more F-leu than the resistant line of the same tumor. The different drug uptake as well as the different Vinca alkaloid binding capacity of membrane fractions of the sensitive and resistant P388 leukemias suggests that the composition and/or the structure of the cell membrane has changed in the resistant line. Vinca alkaloid-induced cell cycle changes were evaluated by cytophotometry. The cytotoxic effect of Vinca alkaloids does not correlate with their ability to arrest cells in metaphase. Multinuclear cells showing higher policy could be detected in the later phase of the treatment; these cells are the representatives of the surviving population. Selective killing of G1 cells is supposed to be a possible way of the cytotoxic action of Vinca alkaloids.","['Csuka, O', 'Sugar, J', 'Palyi, I', 'Somfai-Relle, S']","['Csuka O', 'Sugar J', 'Palyi I', 'Somfai-Relle S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Vincristine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000225502 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1980;37 Suppl 1:83-7. doi: 10.1159/000225502.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population I showed highest degree of synchrony and contained at least 70% G1 cells.

It was shown that the sucrose concentrations used for separation did not affect growth of L5178Y-S cells.

We first determined that test-derived TFTR mutants were phenotypically stable, possessing little or no thymidine kinase activity as measured by labeled thymidine uptake, but demonstrating 100% cross resistance to bromodeoxyuridine. Common solvent vehicles such as acetone, dimethylsulfoxide and ethanol were shown to produce little cytotoxicity and no mutagenic activity when present at 1% levels. Out of a total of 10 noncarcinogens tested, all were negative when results were analyzed by a 2-sample loge t test on control and treated mutant count means. Of the 13 putative animal carcinogens tested, 10 were positive, 2 were negative (auramine O and sodium phenobarbital), and 1 showed sporadic activity (hydrazine sulfate) in the TK assay on the basis of test-derived t statistics. 2 compounds, 1,2-epoxybutane and ICR 191, which have been described as Ames positive non-carcinogens, were also positive in the TK assay.

Preparation and properties of 7H-pyridocarbazole dimers.,1336-43,"In order to obtain antitumor agents, various 7H-pyridocarbazole dimers were prepared by quaternization of the pyridinic nitrogens of the different isomeric 7H-pyridocarbazole rings with halogenoamino alicyclic or aliphatic chains. The dimers interact with DNA more markedly than with the corresponding monomers, and the bisintercalation depends upon the nature, the flexibility, and the ionization state of the linking chains. They most often bisintercalate at pH 5 where the chain is protonated and monointercalate at pH 7.4. The apparent binding constants (kap) range from 10(8) to 10(9) M-1 at pH 5 and from 5 X 10(5) to 2 X 10(7) M-1 at pH 7.4. The bisintercalating dimers covered four DNA base pairs, whereas most of the monointercalating dimers covered two bases pairs. The antitumor activity against L1210 murine leukemia is strongly dependent on the position of attachment, the nature of the linking chain, and its rigidity. Three highly active dimers were obtained in the series of 7H-pyrido[4,3-c]carbazole dimers with rigid bis(ethylpiperidinyl) chains. On the other hand, two ellipticine dimers were prepared which were found completely inactive on L1210.

Preparation and properties of 7H-pyridocarbazoles.,1330-5,"The DNA intercalating compounds derived from 6H-pyridocarbazole (ellipticines, olivacines) elicit high antitumor properties. In order to get information about the mechanism of action of these agents it is necessary to study structurally related analogues. For this purpose, various derivatives of the four isomeric 7H-pyridocarbazoles were synthesized by a single photochemical process on indolylpyridylethylenes. These derivatives are able to intercalate into DNA.

The drug was further studied in mice infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain of the Friend virus (FV-P). In these mice a specific erythropoietin-independent CFU-E population (CFU-EI) replaces the normal erythropoiesis and can be considered a tumor cell population. With the in vitro technique for CFU-E, CFU-EI can easily be quantified and used as a sensitive marker for the development of the disease. Repeated doses of ribavirin reduced the increase of spleen weight after FV-P infection and the progressive transformation of normal CFU-E into CFU-EI was delayed. The further development of the disease remained unaltered. In vitro CFU-E and CFU-EI were inhibited at the same concentrations when the drug was added to the culture medium. In mice pretreated with multiple doses of hydroxyurea, ribavirin delayed the recurrence of Friend leukemia as seen from the spleen weight increase, but the CFU-E population was predominantly Ep-independent. It is concluded that the effects of the drug were due to its cytotoxicity rather than to a specific antiviral effect.","['Opitz, U', 'Seidel, H J', 'Streissle, G']","['Opitz U', 'Seidel HJ', 'Streissle G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic System/drug effects', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Ribavirin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Spleen/drug effects']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00413175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1980;98(1):41-50. doi: 10.1007/BF00413175.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ip dose required after transplant for significant ILS was 40 mg/kg as the total dose. The administration of a single dose 2 days prior to implant produced maximum antitumor effects at 1 mg/kg, with all other doses above and below this level being significantly less effective. Protection was achieved before implant, with the following maximum ILS recorded for each dose and time: 1 mg/kg on Day -2 = 110%; 60 mg/kg on Day -5 = 70%; 10 mg/kg on Day -2 = 50%; and 0.1 and 0.01 mg/kg on either Day -2 or Day -5 = 25%-30%.

It was concluded that the proper adjustment of the dose and time of administration of C. parvum prior to tumor transplant enhanced antitumor activity of this immunopotentiator. Considerably higher doses were required after transplant for the desired effects to be achieved. The cytotoxicity studies demonstrated differences in tumor cell-killing which were dose-related and may be a contributing factor in the dose and time-related antitumor effects of C. parvum.","['Megirian, R', 'Astry, C L', 'Spoor, R P', 'Loose, L']","['Megirian R', 'Astry CL', 'Spoor RP', 'Loose L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity', 'Leukemia P388/*immunology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Propionibacterium acnes']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1980 Aug-Sep;64(8-9):915-20.,,8-9,,['CA-21099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, transplantation immunity is severely impaired in DTIC-treated mice due to the immunodepressant activity of the drug. It follows that the DTIC-mediated increase of tumor immunogenicity effect cannot be of therapeutic value in ordinary conditions. In the present report, we describe the results of studies aimed at restoring immunocompetence of DTIC-treated mice by means of adoptive transfer of syngeneic lymphoid cells. Infusion of spleen cells into DTIC-treated mice failed to restore graft responsiveness even in allogeneic tumor-host combinations. However, when DTIC treatment was followed by administration of cytotoxic alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide (CY) or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), graft responsiveness was partially restored upon adoptive transfer of syngeneic splenocytes. (BALB/c X DBA/2) F1 (hereafter called CD2F1) mice bearing leukemia L1210 Ha were treated as follows: (a) DTIC for increasing the immunogenicity of the leukemic cells; (b) CY or BCNU; and (c) adoptive transfer of CD2F1 lymphocytes. The results showed that: (a) DTIC alone or DTIC plus spleen cells produced little or no increase in survival times with respect to untreated controls; (b) DTIC plus CY or BCNU increased survival times to a larger extent; and (c) the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes produced marked protection of leukemic mice when the hosts had been pretreated with DTIC plus CY or BCNU but not with CY or BCNU without DTIC. These data may provide a model for exploiting DTIC-induced increase of tumor immunogenicity for immunochemotherapeutic regimens.","['Giampietri, A', 'Bonmassar, A', 'Puccetti, P', 'Circolo, A', 'Goldin, A', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Giampietri A', 'Bonmassar A', 'Puccetti P', 'Circolo A', 'Goldin A', 'Bonmassar E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Feb;41(2):681-7.,,2,,['N01-CB-64054/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This association of LDV with a large variety of murine tumors and the known effect of LDV infection on immune competence may suggest the existence of a possible etiological relationship between the virus and murine tumors. We have found that the inoculation of transplantable carcinoma cells to acutely LDV-infected mice is followed by an enhanced rate of tumor growth. To examine the possibility that LDV is involved in the carcinogenic process and may act as a promoter or initiator, we infected mice with LDV at various time intervals prior to, simultaneously with or after their treatment with chemical carcinogens (urethan 3-methylcholanthrene, and 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene) and then followed the development of the malignant disease. No differences in the rate of tumor appearance and in mortality were observed between LDV-infected and uninfected mice. In addition, LDV failed to affect the development of spontaneous reticulum cell sarcoma and lymphatic leukemia in SJL/J, AKR/Cu, and AKR/J mouse strains. It is suggested that, although LDV does not affect the induction of oncogenic processes, this virus may still be capable of promoting the progression of transplantable tumors due to its immunoregulatory properties.","['Isakov, N', 'Feldman, M', 'Segal, S']","['Isakov N', 'Feldman M', 'Segal S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Female', '*Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Virus Diseases/*complications/immunology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Feb;41(2):667-72.,,2,,['N01-CB-63982/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study, which used nitrobenzylthioinosine 5'-phosphate (NBMPR-P), a readily soluble ""prodrug"" form of NBMPR, extended the in vivo protection studies and showed that the half-life of the protection effect was about 4 hr. In chemotherapy experiments, mice bearing transplanted neoplasms were treated with high dosages of nebularine together with protecting doses of NBMPR-P. When mice bearing leukemia L1010 were treated with a potentially lethal regimen of nebularine administered together with NBMPR-P, a substantial kill of leukemic cells resulted (some mice were long-term survivors). The therapeutic effect was optimal at dosage levels of the protecting agent in excess of those required in nonleukemic mice for protection against the lethal nebularine dosages used, suggesting that the therapeutic effect was due to the joint presence in the leukemic cells of a metabolite of NBMPR-P and nebularine; NBMPR-P protection of the leukemic host against nebularine lethality was necessary for the therapeutic effect to be manifested.","['Lynch, T P', 'Paran, J H', 'Paterson, A R']","['Lynch TP', 'Paran JH', 'Paterson AR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', ""65199-10-2 (nitrobenzylthioinosine 5'-monophosphate)"", 'B8B604PS4P (nebularine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Purine Nucleosides/*administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleosides/*administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thioinosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thionucleotides/*administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Feb;41(2):560-5.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within 20 min after treatment with MTX, the pool of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) had decreased by about 50% and during the next 8 hr decreased slowly to 30% of its initial level. When MTX-induced decreases in the cellular contents of deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP), deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) were normalized to percentages of the initial levels, they coincided with the second slower phase of decrease in dTTP. During the study, levels of both dTTP and dCTP remained constant in cells from mice treated with 0.9% NaCl solution, whereas levels of both dATP and dGTP decreased. MTX caused a significantly more rapid decrease in the level of dATP than did 0.9% NaCl solution but not in the level of dGTP. Over a 9-hr period, after injection of ara-C, levels of both dTTP and dCTP doubled while levels of both dATP and dGTP remained unchanged. When ara-C and MTX were administered together, levels of dTTP, dATP, and dGTP did not change significantly, and the increase in dCTP was only 25% of the increase after treatment with ara-C alone. Thus, the most striking change in deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools after combined administration of MTX and ara-C was an increase in dCTP concentration that reached about one-fourth the concentration achieved with ara-C alone. We suggest that MTX, by attenuating the ara-C-induced increase in dCTP, caused a change in the allosteric regulation of either deoxycytidine kinase or deoxycytidylate deaminase (or both), thereby potentiating the activity of ara-C.","['Roberts, D', 'Peck, C']","['Roberts D', 'Peck C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascites', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Feb;41(2):505-10.,,2,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied fresh tumor cells from patients with diverse lymphoid neoplasms and found a discrete range of whole-cell fluorescence polarization values (P values) for each type of neoplasm. Following cell fractionation, however, the P values of isolated plasma membranes from malignant cells did not differ significantly from the values obtained with normal donor lymphocytes. Therefore, the altered whole-cell fluorescence polarization measurements in malignant cells are not likely to be due to gross lipid changes in the plasma membrane. Histochemical staining and cell fractionation revealed the presence of cytoplasmic lipid accumulations, and these had extremely low P values, which could account for the low P values of malignant cells. Complementary studies of lymphoid cell lines showed whole-cell fluorescence polarization measurements to be extremely sensitive to exogenous lipid supplements, but membrane values remained stable. We conclude that alterations in membrane lipid fluidity, as measured by the diphenylhexatriene probe, are not consistently found in lymphoid neoplasms and hence cannot presently be invoked to account for the malignant behavior of these cells. However, intracellular neutral lipid accumulation appears to be a common feature of the lymphoid neoplasm. The lipid alterations described could be characteristic of cell immaturity or proliferation rather than malignancy; nevertheless, they may convey unappreciated biological consequences.","['Spiegel, R J', 'Magrath, I T', 'Shutta, J A']","['Spiegel RJ', 'Magrath IT', 'Shutta JA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Lipids/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology/ultrastructure', '*Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Membrane Lipids']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Feb;41(2):452-8.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compare here the lethality of several nogalamycin analogs against Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), mouse leukemia (L1210), and mouse melanoma (B16) cells in culture. 7-con-O-Methylnogarol (7-con-OMEN) was the most lethal of all the analogs tested. Thus, for CHO cells exposed for two hr to the drug, the 50% lethal doses of 7-con-OMEN, nogalamycin, and dis-nogamycin were 0.25, 2.7, and 5.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In general, CHO cells were less sensitive than B16 or L1210 cells to most compounds. All compounds gave dose-survival curves which consisted of a shoulder region followed by a region of exponential decline in survival. The nogalamycin analogs nogalamycin, dis-nogamycin, 7-con-O-methylnogalarol, and 7-con-OMEN were selected for further study because of their greater lethality in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo. The lethality of these compounds was compared to that of Adriamycin. 7-con-OMEN was more toxic to CHO cells than was Adriamycin but was less toxic to B16 and L1210 cells. All of these compounds (except 7-con-O-methylnogalarol which was not tested) were more lethal to exponentially growing cells than to plateau-phase cells. The survival response after different periods of exposure to these drugs was compared. In order to make valid comparisons of the time-survival response to different drugs, the drug concentrations chosen were such that they were equitoxic after a two-hr exposure. Under these conditions, the order of lethality after long-term exposure (8 hr to 24 hr) was nogalamycin > dis-nogamycin > 7-con-OMEN, Adriamycin > 7-con-O-methylnogalarol.

Survival and relapse-free interval were prolonged in all cases when chemotherapy had begun within a week of diagnosis and had continued with intervals of not more than 21 d between courses. Although patients whose chemotherapy had been delayed while radiotherapy was given fared worse overall, the incidence of mediastinal relapse was significantly increased when mediastinal irradiation had been omitted altogether or had been given in fractions of less than 100 rads.

We examined their myocardia by electron microscopy (EM) and their skin by light microscopy (LM), and report here the findings of these two examinations. The mortality was very high for the groups of hamsters treated with ADM, DTR, DRB, eADM, and RBZ (all treated hamsters died before the end of the fourth week) and very low for those treated with ACM and AD-32 (for each drug, only one of the 21 treated animals died after 4 weeks of treatment). After the first week of treatment and chiefly after the second week, all treated hamsters, except those treated with ACM, showed very severe EM alterations of their myocardia. EM detected almost no early myocardial lesions in ACM-treated hamsters but, after 4 weeks of treatment, severe cardiac lesions also appeared which, like those after AD-32, were nonlethal and reversible. LM of the skin detected degenerative lesions with atrophy of all epidermic layers and a loss of the hair (alopecia) in all treated hamsters except those treated with ACM and AD-32; the skin in these two groups preserved its normal histologic structure. These observations agree with phase I-II clinical ACM studies in which the rate of ECG abnormalities was 4.5% and the rate of alopecia 0%, and with an early AD-32 clinical study conducted by Blum [3].","['Dantchev, D', 'Slioussartchouk, V', 'Paintrand, M', 'Bourut, C', 'Hayat, M', 'Mathe, G']","['Dantchev D', 'Slioussartchouk V', 'Paintrand M', 'Bourut C', 'Hayat M', 'Mathe G']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

Aplastic anaemia was defined as pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow at some time during the illness. Seven patients terminated with acute leukaemia, 8 developed haematological features of sideroblastic anaemia and 5 showed a red cell membrane defect commonly found in paroxysmal noctural haemoglobinuria. Complete recovery occurred in only 4 patients; 70 others showed a partial remission with some residual haematological abnormality in peripheral blood. Eighteen of these had spontaneous remission. Remission was brief in 27 patients who died; only 32 patients remained in partial remission. Twenty-five per cent. of the patients with AA run an acute course and die within 6 months of the time of diagnosis. The remainder run a subacute or chronic course, punctuated in some cases by a transient remission, but in others by a conversion to other related haematological disorders. An acute course is suggested by a rapid onset of symptoms, a falling neutrophil count, a haemoglobin level less than 5 g/dl and a very low platelet count. A chronic course is likely in those patients who have a slow onset of symptoms, a stable neutrophil count and a Hb level in excess of 5 g/dl. The authors' experience shows that the disease runs either of the 2 courses irrespective of the supportive therapy.","['Mir, M A', 'Geary, C G']","['Mir MA', 'Geary CG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Postgrad Med J,Postgraduate medical journal,0234135,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/etiology', 'Female', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/pgmj.56.655.322 [doi]'],ppublish,Postgrad Med J. 1980 May;56(655):322-9. doi: 10.1136/pgmj.56.655.322.,,655,,,PMC2425624,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall mortality and number of deaths from all neoplasms were lower than the 'expected' figures. No appreciable or significant excess was found for cancer of the oesophagus, larynx, lung, and bladder, or for leukaemia.

Murine SGF was a partially purified preparation from the serum-free culture media of mouse fibroblasts transformed by Moloney murine sarcoma virus. SGFs stimulated DNA-synthesis in resting cells and induced them to grow to higher densities than control cells. With continued exposure to SGFs, MMC-E cells lost their postconfluency inhibition of division and formed small expanding foci. When the SGFs were removed and the cells were subcultured, they regained their normal phenotype, showing that the effects of SGFs are reversible on these epithelial cells. SGFs could also stimulate the MMC-E epithelial cells to grow in soft agar, like the syngeneic fibroblasts (MMC-F) from the same mouse embryo, but slower than the control fibroblastic clone. Microgram quantities of SGFs were needed to stimulate soft agar growth of MMC-E cells. The results indicate that SGF can bring about a phenotypic change in the growth pattern of epithelial cells as well as fibroblastic cells.","['Keski-Oja, J', 'de Larco, J E', 'Rapp, U R', 'Todaro, G J']","['Keski-Oja J', 'de Larco JE', 'Rapp UR', 'Todaro GJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Growth Substances/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/metabolism']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041040107 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1980 Jul;104(1):41-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041040107.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By thin-layer chromatography, methylation analysis and neuraminidase treatment they were identified as N-glycoloylneuraminosyl and N-acetylneuraminosyl lactosylceramides, N-glycoloylneuraminosylneolactotetraosylceramide, di-(N-glycoloylneuraminosyl), di-(N-acetylneuraminosyl) lactosylceramides and N-glycoloylneuraminosyl-N-acetylneuraminosyllactosylceramide. The ganglioside spectra of leukemic peripheral lymphocytes were different from those of normal peripheral lymphocytes and resembled the ganglioside profile of the thymus. The data obtained indicate that, in the normal animal, the development of thymocytes into mature peripheral lymphocytes is accompanied by loss of disialosyl-gangliosides and sialosylneolactotetraosylceramide. It is concluded that both the structure and the composition of the lymphocyte ganglioside become more simple during maturation and ageing of the lymphocyte.","['Dyatlovitskaya, E V', 'Zablotskaya, A E', 'Azizov, Y M', 'Bergelson, L D']","['Dyatlovitskaya EV', 'Zablotskaya AE', 'Azizov YM', 'Bergelson LD']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*metabolism', 'Gangliosides/*analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/analysis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymph/analysis', 'Lymph Nodes/analysis', 'Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Neuraminidase', 'Spleen/analysis', 'Thymus Gland/*analysis']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1980.tb04889.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1980 Sep;110(2):475-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1980.tb04889.x.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No significant metastasis to other lymph nodes or organs was detected on Day 12 after the inoculation of 10(6) P388 cells in the forefootpad, except that a lesser extent of metastasis was observed in some cases in the right inguinal lymph node, liver, and spleen. A quantitative estimation of metastasis in the axillary lymph node was accomplished by transferring the lymph node i.p. to the recipient mice (bioassay method). The metastasis of P388 cells to the axillary lymph node occurred linearly depending on the elapse of time after inoculation. In studying the chemotherapeutic effect on lymph node metastasis, two experimental models were established. Model 1, 10(6) P388 cells were inoculated into the right forefootpad, and drug was administered thereafter. The right axillary lymph node was removed on Day 8, and the extent of inhibition of lymph node metastasis was estimated by the bioassay method. In Model 2, P388 cells were inoculated, and the right forelimb including original tumor was amputated on Day 6 when the metastasis had already been established.

The cells differed markedly in mobility. This variation was related neither to cell growth nor to rates of endogenous respiration and aerobic glycolysis. The nonleukemic tumor cells showed higher mobility than did the leukemic cells. Additional increases in mobility appear to be related to suppressed oxygen uptake, which results from the addition of glucose or 0.05 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol. The augmented negative surface charge does not seem to be related to those ionogenic sites susceptible to neuraminidase. However, RNase treatment of the nonleukemic tumor cell does reveal the presence in their surface membrane of negatively charged sites susceptible to this enzyme. Such RNase-susceptible ionogenic sites presumably redistribute at the cell surface membrane from the inner sites as a response to suppressed oxygen uptake. This results in a higher negative surface charge and increased mobility. The leukemic cells, on the other hand, did not show any change in oxygen uptake or mobility in the presence of glucose. Moreover, the reduced rate of oxygen uptake induced by the addition of 0.05 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol did not result in any significant alterations in mobility. This is consistent with the observation that the ionogenic sites susceptible to RNase do not appear at the surface of the leukemic cells upon suppressed oxygen uptake. The leukemic cells have thus been shown to differ from the nonleukemic tumor cells in certain aspects of their glucose metabolism as well as in the electrophoretic properties of their surface.","['Miyamoto, K', 'Terasaki, T']","['Miyamoto K', 'Terasaki T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Lactates)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/*physiopathology', 'Cell Division', 'Electrophoresis', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', '*Oxygen Consumption', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism']",1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Dec;40(12):4751-7.,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chromatographic behavior of this molecule was characterized, as was its ability to inhibit adenylosuccinate synthetase, an enzyme long considered to be the locus of action of the drug. The Ki of-L-alanosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide versus a partially purified adenylosuccinate synthetase frm the L5178y/AR leukemia of C57BL X DBA/2 F1 (hereafter called BD2F1) mice was 0.228 microM, whereas the Ki of L-alanosine was 57.23 mM. Administration of 50 microCi of DL-[1-14C]alanosine along with unlabeled L-alanosine (500 mg/kg) to BD2F1 mice bearing s.c. nodules of Leukemia L5178Y/AR resulted in the accumulation in tumors of a material with properties compatible with those of L-alanosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide. It coeluted with L-alanosyl-5-amino-r-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide in the high-resolution chromatographic system used, was Bratton-Marshall positive, and inhibited adenylosuccinate synthetase strongly. In tumor nodules 2 hr after dosage, the concentration of this compound approximated 70 microM. Under the same circumstances, the intratumoral concentration of L-alanosine was found to be 440 microM. At this concentration, the antibiotic itself exerts only a marginal inhibition of leukemic adenylosuccinate synthetase. In ancillary studies, it was shown for the first time in vivo that the parenteral administration of L-alanosine reduces the specific activity of intratumoral adenylosuccinate synthetase by 70% and depresses the synthesis of DNA to an equivalent or greater extent; adenine but not hypoxanthine (both at 250 mg/kg) was able to reverse the latter inhibition. No effect on purine salvage enzymes was exerted by L-alanosine. Viewed in concert, these experiments establish that the adduct of L-alanosine with 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid is formed by neoplastic cells in vivo and that this anabolite is most probably responsible for the inhibition of adneylosuccinate synthetase and, in turn, for the diminished synthesis of DNA seen after a therapeutic dose of L-alanosine.","['Tyagi, A K', 'Cooney, D A']","['Tyagi AK', 'Cooney DA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '2CNI71214Y (alanosine)', '5MA501Z5DO (carboxyaminoimidazole ribotide)', '76573-09-6 (alanosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxylic acid ribonucleotide)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.4 (Adenylosuccinate Synthase)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Adenylosuccinate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Alanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Nitrosamines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism']",1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Dec;40(12):4390-7.,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When C-1 or C-2 is administered i.p. as a single injection at 10% lethal dose (approximately LD10) to mice bearing L1210 (1 x 10(5) cells i.p.), early treatment produces a 5- to 6-log tumor cell kill and results in substantial numbers of long-term survivors (greater than or equal to 30 days). Such antitumor activity is comparable to that of CP treatment. However, i.p. administration of either sulfido derivative produces liver atrophy and fibrosis of hepatic capsular structures. Hepatotoxicity is eliminated if single-dose C-2 (less than or equal to LD10) is administered i.v.; however, when administered by this route, C-2 results in only a 1-log cell kill of i.v. implanted leukemic cells as compared to the 4-log tumor cell kill obtained with CP given i.v. In addition to hepatotoxicity, C-2 causes an acute and dose-limiting toxicity in mice, manifested by severe muscular spasms and cessation of breathing. In the treatment of advanced L1210, C-2 shows no therapeutic advantage over CP. When mice bearing s.c. Lewis lung carcinoma receive early i.p. treatment with CP, C-1, or C-2, each drug results in long-term tumor-free survivors. However, CP (< LD10) consistently cures all mice, whereas C-1 or C-2 (approximately LD10) produces only 10 to 30% tumor-free survivors. These data suggest that, in the L1210 and Lewis lung tumor systems studied, the two activated CP derivatives offer no therapeutic advantage over CP.

These suspensions were analyzed for la antigens, surface immunoglobulin (Slg), sheep erythrocyte (E) rosette formation and, in some instances, acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) activity. The results of these studies were correlated with the expression of cytochemically demonstrable BG activity. The percentage of BG+ lymphocytes was found to be comparable, within 10%, to the percentage of E+ (T) cells in the majority of normal, non-neoplastic peripheral blood, tonsil, spleen, and lymph node specimens examined. Occasionally, the percentage of E+ cells exceeded the percentage of BG+ cells by 20% or more, suggesting the presence of an E+BG- T cell subpopulation. BG+ B lymphocytes were only demonstrated in 1 of 40 non-neoplastic lymphoid specimens. The neoplastic B cells in each of 14 B cell (la+Slg+E-) lymphomas were BG-. However, a variable proportion of the neoplastic cells isolated from 6 cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and neoplastic plasma cells isolated from 7 cases of multiple myeloma expressed BG activity. Thus, it appears that both normal and neoplastic BG- and BG+ B lymphocyte populations exist; the latter may be related to a state of activation or a stage of B cell differentiation.

The amount of uridine necessary for cell division when de novo uridine nucleotide synthesis is inhibited by pyrazofurin is: L5178Y, 30.5; P388, 39.7; L1210, 53.3: W256, 70.6; and S180, 886 fmol/cell. Cytidine, which can be deaminated to uridine, will substitute for uridine to maintain normal cell growth in the presence of growth-inhibitory concentrations of pyrazofurin (5 microM). The requirements for cytidine and uridine are identical. If cytidine deamination is prevented by tetrahydrouridine (100 microM), cytidine can no longer support growth in the presence of pyrazofurin. Cytidine and uridine, as expected, are additive in their effect to permit normal growth of pyrazofurin treated cells. Tetrahydrouridine does not alter this additive effect, indicating that when both nucleotides are added to pyrazofurin treated cells each nucleotide replenishes their respective nucleotide pools and cytidine deamination is unnecessary to allow cell growth. Incorporation of [14C]uridine into the acid insoluble cell fraction of L5178Y cells was 25 fmol/cell at 48 h and remained constant during the remaining growth of the pyrazofurin treated cell suspension. The [14C]uridine acid soluble pool of 4 fmol/cell also was maximum at 48 h but declined during the subsequent growth of the suspension culture to approx. 2 fmol/cell at 96 h. This decline in the acid soluble pool is correlated with a 42% decrease in modal cell volume during this phase of cell growth which would maintain a constant specific activity of uridine in this pool. This may explain the decline in the acid soluble pool while the acid insoluble pool remains constant during growth of suspension cultures of L51878Y cells. The block in pyrimidine synthesis de novo induced by pyrazofurin provides a useful and quick method for the evaluation of uridine and cytidine metabolism of tumor cell specimens.","['Cadman, E', 'Benz, C']","['Cadman E', 'Benz C']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '4B15044GQZ (pyrazofurin)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Amides', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma 256, Walker/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Ribose', 'Sarcoma 180/metabolism', 'Uridine/*metabolism']",1980/10/17 00:00,1980/10/17 00:01,['1980/10/17 00:00'],"['1980/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2787(80)90111-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(80)90111-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Oct 17;609(3):372-82. doi: 10.1016/0005-2787(80)90111-2.,,3,,"['5R23 CA 23187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09200 02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 73 tumors induced by the regressor strain of MSV-M (R-MSV-M) regressed and 181 of 183 tumors induced by a progressor strain (P-MSV-M) grew progressively and killed their hosts between 16 and 171 days after infection. Even after inoculation of about 4 FFU of P-MSV-M tumor development may occur and lead to progressively growing tumors. Both strains of MSV-M induce strong immune responses in their host, namely cytotoxic effector cells, cytotoxic antibodies and tumor resistance. Simultaneous injection of mice on separate sites with P-MSV-M on one side and R-MSV-M producing ascitic cells on the other side did not induce mutual influences on the different tumor courses. It is therefore concluded that the immune response is obviously not decisive for the failure of P-MSV-M induced tumors to regress. From seven P-MSV-M induced primary tumors two producer and five nonproducer transformants could be isolated, maintained in culture and partly held as easily transplantable tumors in adult immunocompetent mice. Both producer transformants release sarcoma virus with the capacity to induce progressively growing tumors in adult mice. All transformants induce progressively growing tumors after transplantation independent of the applied cell dose. It is concluded that the ability of the P-MSV-M to induce stably transformed cells (in contrast to R-MSV-M, WEILAND et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1979) favours clonal development and ultimately progressive tumor course, in spite of the presence of an immune response.","['Weiland, E', 'Mussgay, M']","['Weiland E', 'Mussgay M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01315040 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1980;66(1):1-10. doi: 10.1007/BF01315040.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to defined criteria, the leukemic cells could not be classified by conventional light microscopic techniques employed in the study of hematopoietic tissue. Cytochemical studies including peroxidase, periodic acid schiff (PAS) and nonspecific esterase (alpha napthyl butyrate-reacting esterase) stains were done on fresh bone marrow samples, and the percentage of positive leukemia cells for each of these stains was determined on 200 cells. In this series of leukemias, cytochemistry at the light microscope level did not contribute to further classification. Subsequent electron microscopic examination of bone marrow samples from these patients confirmed the immaturity and nuclear/cytoplasmic asynchrony of the leukemic cells. Several in vivo neoplastic markers, such as nuclear blebs, increased nuclear bodies, and cytoplasmic fibrillar bundles could be demonstrated in these cells. Fourteen cases from this series exhibited peroxidase-positive developmental granule formation at the ultrastructural level and were reclassified as acute granulocyte leukemia (AGL).

The diagnosis was based upon a high index of suspicion of invasive candidiasis in this immunosuppressed group of patients; the failure of the patients to respond to the empiric administration of broad spectrum antibiotics, salicylates and steroids, and the presence of discrete scintiscan defects on liver-spleen scan with both 99Tc sulfur colloid and 67Ga citrate. Multiple splenic abscesses containing candidal organisms were confirmed in all three patients, and two of the three also had multiple small abscesses of the liver. The fourth patient, whose liver-spleen scintiscans were abnormal only in showing splenomegaly and whose febrile course responded to aspirin, did not have a candidal abscess of the spleen at the time of celiotomy which was undertaken for fever of unknown cause. The antemortem diagnosis and treatment of candidal splenic abscess in patients with leukemia is dependent upon a high index of suspicion and appropriate clinical correlation with diagnostic tests.

The results suggest that decrease in the complexity of the message population and increase in the concentration of globin mRNA are important in erythrodifferentiation.","['Obinata, M', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Obinata M', 'Ikawa Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Anemia/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Poly A/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1980/09/25 00:00,1980/09/25 00:01,['1980/09/25 00:00'],"['1980/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/8.18.4271 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1980 Sep 25;8(18):4271-82. doi: 10.1093/nar/8.18.4271.,,18,,,PMC324234,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPA induces a terminal cell differentiation in some murine and human myeloid leukaemia and histiocytic lymphoma cells. We report here the effect of TPA on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) biopsy cells in vitro. In four out of five CLL patients studied, TPA induced the appearance of 90-100% of lymphoblastoid and plasmacytoid cells after 4 days of culture. Under the influence of TPA, 86-97% of the cells expressed with time increasing amounts of intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin (C-Ig) of the same phenotype as that detected on the surface (S-Ig) of fresh, non-induced CLL cells. A parallel decrease in both monoclonal S-Ig density and DNA synthesis of the CLL cells was observed. Electron microscopic studies showed a muturation towards plasma cells. We therefore conclude that TPA is capable of inducing differentiation of CLL cells in vitro.","['Totterman, T H', 'Nilsson, K', 'Sundstrom, C']","['Totterman TH', 'Nilsson K', 'Sundstrom C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1980/11/13 00:00,1980/11/13 00:01,['1980/11/13 00:00'],"['1980/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/288176a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Nov 13;288(5787):176-8. doi: 10.1038/288176a0.,,5787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different patterns of virus activation have been observed in a variety of different mouse strains. However, because there are multiple copies of closely related endogenous viruses in every mouse strain, the genetic basis of the differential expression of these genes is poorly understood. A new substrain of mice, BALB/Mo, was derived previously carrying the exogenous Moloney leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) genome on chromosome 6 (ref. 14). Virus activation occurs in lymphatic tissues of all BALB/Mo mice soon after birth. We report here the derivation of three new substrains of mice each carrying a single M-MuLV genome on different chromosomal integration sites. Each locus was associated with a distinct phenotype of virus expression. Evidence is presented that apparently identical viral genomes show differences in spontaneous virus activation and that defective viral genomes can be carried in the germ line of mice.","['Jahner, D', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Jahner D', 'Jaenisch R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Virus Activation', 'Virus Replication']",1980/10/02 00:00,1980/10/02 00:01,['1980/10/02 00:00'],"['1980/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/287456a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Oct 2;287(5781):456-8. doi: 10.1038/287456a0.,,5781,,['N0ICP 71008/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two children with leukaemia and a third with thymic dysplasia had prolongaed illness without typical measles exanthemata. All showed a striking proliferation of the respiratory epithelia, with formation of peribronchiolar fibro-epithelial nodules and cystic transformation of tracheo-bronchial glands. The nodular lesions contained many giant cells and were seen radiologically as multiple slowly-enlarging pulmonary opacities, a pattern which appears to be highly characteristic of measles infection in the presence of cellular immune deficiency. Two other children showed similar proliferative lesions, but had shorter illness with exanthemata and few tissue giant cells; these differences are attributed to the late appearance of a cellular immune response in less severe immune deficiencies. Two children who had no evidence of immune deficiencies died of acute viral alveolitis, one in the pre-exanthematous phase. Acute alveolitis was characterized radiologically by the rapid development of diffuse pulmonary opacification and by variable cytological features which correlated with other evidence for the presence or absence of a cellular immune response against the virus.","['Becroft, D M', 'Osborne, D R']","['Becroft DM', 'Osborne DR']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Bronchi/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Infant', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Measles/*pathology', 'Radiography', 'Trachea/pathology']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1980.tb02935.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1980 Jul;4(4):401-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1980.tb02935.x.,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanism of alterations of polyamine levels in physiological fluids in human cancer, polyamine levels of bone-marrow plasma from adult patients with leukemia were studied. Significant correlations were observed between bone-marrow cellularity and spermidine, between peripheral white blood cell counts and spermidine and spermine, and between absolute blast count and spermidine and spermine among untreated patients with acute leukemia. Untreated patients with chronic leukemia showed significantly elevated levels of polyamines relative to untreated patients with acute leukemia, indicating a higher turnover of bone-marrow cells in chronic leukemia than in acute leukemia. Chemotherapy-treated patients with acute leukemia who were in remission or who did not respond to the agent showed low polyamine levels. Patients who showed a destruction of tumor cell during chemotherapy gave high levels of polyamines.

This effect was abolished upon removal of hydroxyurea from cells. The enhancement of ara-CTP by hydroxyurea was observed for concentrations of ara-C ranging from 0.1 to 100 microM. These changes were not associated with alteration in the activity of deoxycytidine kinase, measured in extracts from L1210 cells both with and without deoxycytidine triphosphate.

Antisera against the minor histocompatibility antigens of Hooded rats were raised by immunizing August rats with grafts of tumours or normal tissue. Such antisera, if transferred to normal unimmunized August rats, cause them to reject i.v. administered Hooded rat leukemia (HRL) cells within a few hours, and X-irradiated August rats, for whom a graft of HRL is lethal, can survive indefinitely if pretreated with the antiserum. The distribution of 125I-labelled HRL cells in the tissues of August rats was followed at times after their injection, and it was found that, in the presence of antiserum, i.v. administered leukaemic cells are rapidly destroyed in the liver and spleen.

Antibody-mediated splenic and hepatic clearance of the leukaemia cells is unaffected by total-body X-irradiation but reduced by treating the rats with colloidal carbon. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the rejection of HRL across the histocompatibility barrier studied is, in the presence of antibody, effected by immunophagocytosis.","['Denham, S', 'Hooton, J W', 'Barfoot, R K', 'Alexander, P', 'Mayol, R', 'Wrathmell, A B']","['Denham S', 'Hooton JW', 'Barfoot RK', 'Alexander P', 'Mayol R', 'Wrathmell AB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*analysis', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Male', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats', 'Spleen/immunology']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1980.252 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1980 Sep;42(3):408-15. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1980.252.,,3,,,PMC2010402,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibiotic sensitivity of the intestine microautoflora was determined before, during and after the antibiotic use, by the methods of gradient dishes and paper disks. It was found that during the use of nonadsorbing antibiotics the resistance of E. coli to gentamicin increased and only 3--4 weeks after discontinuation of the antibiotic use it regained the initial level. The shifts in sensitivity of staphylococcus to ristomycin and yeasts to nystatin were of the same character but less pronounced. Sensitivity of the intestine microautoflora to neomycin, monomycin, oxytetracycline and polymyxin decreased during decontamination and remained unchanged for 3--4 weeks after discontinuation of the antibiotic use. Some other characteristic features of the shifts in sensitivity of the intestine microflora to ristomycin, novobiocin and oxacillin were noted.

Mononuclear cell preparations containing 82%, 51%, and 42% hairy cells (HC), respectively, were obtained from three males with the typical syndrome and characteristic tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-staining HC. Monocyte features were lacking in that HC did not stain for alpha-napthylacetate esterase, lacked receptors for C3, failed to produce chemiluminescence, and produced decreased 51Cr release in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against human red cell targets. Receptors for sheep erythrocytes, a T-cell marker, were decreased. Evidence against a B-cell origin of HC was provided by low numbers of slg staining and C3 receptor-bearing cells. Our results favor the hypothesis that HC in these three patients represent neoplastic proliferation of Null lymphocytes.

The frequency of weight loss ranged from 31 percent for favorable non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to 87 percent in gastric cancer. Median survival was significantly shorter in nine protocols for the patients with weight loss compared to the patients with no weight loss. Chemotherapy response rates were lower in the patients with weight loss, but only in patients with breast cancer was this difference significant. Decreasing weight was correlated with decreasing performance status except for patients with pancreatic and gastric cancer. Within performance status categories, weight loss was associated with decreased median survival. The frequency of weight loss increased with increasing number of anatomic sites involved with metastases, but within categories of anatomic involvement, weight loss was associated with decreased median survival. These observations emphasize the prognostic effect of weight loss, especially in patients with a favorable performance status or a limited anatomic involvement with tumor.","['Dewys, W D', 'Begg, C', 'Lavin, P T', 'Band, P R', 'Bennett, J M', 'Bertino, J R', 'Cohen, M H', 'Douglass, H O Jr', 'Engstrom, P F', 'Ezdinli, E Z', 'Horton, J', 'Johnson, G J', 'Moertel, C G', 'Oken, M M', 'Perlia, C', 'Rosenbaum, C', 'Silverstein, M N', 'Skeel, R T', 'Sponzo, R W', 'Tormey, D C']","['Dewys WD', 'Begg C', 'Lavin PT', 'Band PR', 'Bennett JM', 'Bertino JR', 'Cohen MH', 'Douglass HO Jr', 'Engstrom PF', 'Ezdinli EZ', 'Horton J', 'Johnson GJ', 'Moertel CG', 'Oken MM', 'Perlia C', 'Rosenbaum C', 'Silverstein MN', 'Skeel RT', 'Sponzo RW', 'Tormey DC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', '*Body Weight', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",1980/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0149-2918(05)80001-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0149-2918(05)80001-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1980 Oct;69(4):491-7. doi: 10.1016/s0149-2918(05)80001-3.,,4,,"['CA 17145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presently known transforming retroviruses contain transforming genes which were probably derived by recombination of a slow oncogenic retrovirus with cellular sequences closely related to these genes. It was recently reported that cellular DNA fragments from normal tissue culture cells could transform mouse fibroblasts in vitro with a low efficiency. High efficiency of transformation was observed in secondary transfections only when high molecular weight DNA from transformed recipient cells was used as the transforming agent. We observed that DNA isolated from different BALB/c mouse organs can transform both NIH/3T3 and BALB/3T3 cells, although at a low frequency. In attempts to increase the initial efficiency of transformation, we have found that preinfection of recipient 3T3 cells with murine leukaemia viruses markedly enhances focus formation by normal BALB/c DNA fragments.","['Krump-Konvalinkova, V', 'van den Berg, K J']","['Krump-Konvalinkova V', 'van den Berg KJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Virus Activation']",1980/09/25 00:00,1980/09/25 00:01,['1980/09/25 00:00'],"['1980/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/287353a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 Sep 25;287(5780):353-4. doi: 10.1038/287353a0.,,5780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggested that Rauscher SFFV encodes a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 54,000 (gp54) that reacts with antisera made to the envelope glycoprotein (gp70) of ecotropic murine leukemia viruses, as well as with a rat antiserum that reacts with the gp70's of dual-tropic mink cell focus-inducing and HIX viruses but not with the gp70's of ecotropic viruses. In these respects and in its tryptic peptide map, Rauscher SFFV-encoded gp54 is nearly identical to the gp55 glycoprotein which we previously reported to be encoded by Friend SFFV (Dresler et al., J. Virol. 30:564--575, 1979). However, gp54 is slightly smaller, and it lacks one methionine-containing tryptic peptide that occurs in gp55. Studies with cytotoxic antiserum in the presence of complement and with a rosetting technique which employed sheep erythrocytes coupled to protein A suggested that the gp54 and gp55 glycoproteins are weakly expressed on the surface membranes of SFFV-infected cells. In addition, the Rauscher SFFV genome also encodes gag polyproteins which appear to be identical to the gag polyproteins encoded by helper Rauscher murine leukemia virus, but differ from the antigenically related polyproteins encoded by some but not all clones of Friend SFFV. Furthermore, the glycosylated gag polyproteins encoded by Rauscher SFFV and by some Friend SFFVs also appear to be expressed on the surface membranes of infected cells. These results suggest that similar env gene recombination and partial deletion events were involved in the independent origins of two different strains of acute erythroleukemia virus.","['Ruta, M', 'Kabat, D']","['Ruta M', 'Kabat D']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/genetics']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.35.3.844-853.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1980 Sep;35(3):844-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.35.3.844-853.1980.,,3,,"['CA2302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC288878,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the mechanism(s) associated with the decrease in platelets, serial thrombokinetic studies were performed on various days after intravenous inoculation of 10(6) L5178Y ascites cells. At the nadir of thrombocytopenia (day 5), the recovery and circulating half-time of transfused normal 51Cr-platelets was only one half of control values. The loss of circulating radioactivity (70%) at 1 hr was accounted for by splenic (40%) and hepatic (30%) accumulation of labeled platelets. However, the liver contained three times more radioactivity per milligram of tissue than the spleen. There was no increase in hepatic accumulation of 59Fe-labeled red cells under the same conditions. When 51Cr-labeled leukemic platelets (day 3) were infused into normal animals, the circulating half-time was 50% of control. Despite spleen and liver enlargement, the blood volume of the leukemic mice did not increase. The megakaryocyte concentration remained unchanged after inoculation of leukemic cells, but the diameter of megakaryocytes increased significantly from days 5 to 10. These studies show that thrombocytopenia in mice transplanted with L5178Y leukemia occurs as a result of shortened platelet survival and increased organ sequestration. The increase in hepatic platelet accumulation suggests that the mechanism of thrombocytopenia is platelet specific and is not due to passive organ pooling.","['Scarborough, V', 'Jackson, C W', 'Whidden, M A']","['Scarborough V', 'Jackson CW', 'Whidden MA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,,IM,"['Animals', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Cell Survival', 'Leukemia L5178/*complications', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*complications', 'Megakaryocytes/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(80)90130-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1980 Nov;96(5):822-9.,,5,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 19270/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was made possible by virtue of the fact that the monoclonal antibody preparation used was completely incapable of directly hemagglutinating SRBC, although it possessed a high titer as assessed by direct hemolysis or direct hemagglutination. The monoclonal IgG2b- coated SRBC indicator cells were compared to SRBC coated with subhemagglutinating amounts of the IgG fraction of a hemagglutinating rabbit anti-SRBC antiserum: at high coupling concentrations, the monoclonal antibody-coupled SRBC gave consistently higher percentages of Fc rosettes, a large proportion of which were large and multi-layered, when various lymphoid cell populations and a variety of Fc receptor-positive cultured tumor cell line populations were tested. The increased sensitivity of the Fc rosette attained by this method may depend on the nature of the monoclonal anti-SRBC reagent used. Thus, indicator cells prepared by incubation with high concentrations of IgG1 subclass-specific non-hemagglutinating monoclonal anti-SRBC antibodies always gave significantly lower percentages of Fc rosettes than conventionally prepared indicator cells.","['Kerbel, R S']",['Kerbel RS'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies', 'Antibody Formation', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Goats', 'Hemagglutination Tests', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Rabbits', '*Receptors, Fc', '*Rosette Formation', 'Sheep']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(80)90218-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(80)90218-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1980;34(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(80)90218-5.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In children with acute leukemia, an impaired immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody response to poliovirus was documented previously. It was of interest, therefore, to determine the immunoclass of antibodies produced against the O antigens of bacteria causing bacteremia in patients with leukemia and other malignancies. For control purposes, parallel studies were carried out in patients without maligancies but with infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. The patients with malignancies were adults, and those without malignancies were children. The serum specimens were selected from patients mounting an antibody response. IgG and IgM antibodies were identified by mercaptoethanol reduction and chromatography. Antibody titers against the O antigens of enteric bacteria were determined by the hemagglutination procedure. Antibodies of both IgM and IgG immunoclasses were produced by all but 1 of 16 patients with leukemia and by all but 1 of 12 subjects with other malignancies. Thus, a specific IgM immune deficiency in adult patients with leukemia or other malignancies complicated by bacteremia was not present; however, the magnitude of the antibody response of the patient with leukemia was less than that of the subjets with other maligancies, with the median antibody titers of the former being 320 and those of the latter being 2,560.","['Gannon, P J', 'Surgalla, M J', 'Fitzpatrick, J E', 'Neter, E']","['Gannon PJ', 'Surgalla MJ', 'Fitzpatrick JE', 'Neter E']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', 'Child', 'Hemagglutination Tests', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Sepsis/*immunology']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.12.1.60-62.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1980 Jul;12(1):60-2. doi: 10.1128/jcm.12.1.60-62.1980.,,1,,,PMC273521,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uracil and 5-fluorouracil shared a saturable transport system (Km = 5 to 15 mM) capable of rapid equilibration of these substrates across the cell membrane (t 1/2 at 25 degrees in first-order range of concentration = 25 to 58 sec). Thus it seems unlikely that transport is limiting the incorporation of uracil or fluorouracil. Their transport was inhibited by various nucleosides and hypoxanthine. Only the non-ionized form of fluorouracil was a substrate for the transporter; exclusion of charged pyrimidines may explain why orotate was not a substrate at physiological pH. Orotate permeated the cell membrane much more slowly (t 1/2 = 2890 to 6930 sec); its permeation was apparently non-mediated and rate-determining in the conversion of extracellular orotate to intracellular nucleotides.","['Wohlhueter, R M', 'McIvor, R S', 'Plagemann, P G']","['Wohlhueter RM', 'McIvor RS', 'Plagemann PG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', '61H4T033E5 (Orotic Acid)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Orotic Acid/*metabolism', 'Ovary', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Uracil/*metabolism']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041040305 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1980 Sep;104(3):309-19. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041040305.,,3,,['GM24468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restriction of the chain lenght.,517-24,"1. Poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized in nuclei isolated from Friend erythroleukemic cells was characterized. Although the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis of cells induced to differentiate was suppressed to about one-third of that of uninduced cells, the chain length were identical, and were clearly restricted within a narrow band in polyacrylamide gels, moving at about half the speed of bromphenol blue. 2. The restriction of chain length was also observed in rat liver nuclei, though some poly(ADP-ribose) chains could be degraded into smaller pieces during incubation. Treatment of nuclei with a high concentration of detergent and sonication before incubation caused aberrant synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) chains which were not restricted in size. 3. In contrast, the average chain length of the 3H-labeled portion of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized during incubation of nuclei with 3H-NAD+ was found to be reduced to 50% of that in the induced cells. 4. Under our reaction conditions, about 95% of newly synthesized poly(ADP-ribose) was linked to non-histone nuclear proteins. The total content of the non-histones was reduced to about 50% by treatment with inducers. 5. In view of the above findings, it is suggested that the decrease of chain initiation frequency caused by the partial loss of available acceptor sites may be correlated with the suppression of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in induced cells.","['Morioka, K', 'Tanaka, K', 'Ono, T']","['Morioka K', 'Tanaka K', 'Ono T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Diamines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*biosynthesis', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a132998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1980 Aug;88(2):517-24. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a132998.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best reconstituting activity was detected in the supernates from glass-adherent cells, or unfractionated Lymphoprep cells, while those obtained from nylon-fibre non-adherent cells gave variable results sometimes containing no activity at all. It was shown that reconstitution was achieved by the uptake of Fc receptors present in the supernate which inhibited Fc rosette formation. Inhibition was also achieved with supernates from peripheral blood cells of a patient with monocytic leukaemia. Only autologous but not allogeneic cell supernates could reconstitute Fc receptors.

When reserpine was administered by a single ip injection (2.5 mg/kg) on day 1, the effect of subsequent administration of CAP-2, mitomycin-C, or vinblastine was synergistically enhanced. In this combination with reserpine, the acute lethality of CAP-2 on the host animals was apparently decreased. Among other sympatholytic drugs, rescinnamine, a central nervous system depressant, slightly potentiated the antitumor effect of CAP-2. On the other hand, when reserpine-induced hypothermia was prevented by maintenance of the ambient temperature at 30 degrees, the synergistic combined effect of reserpine was diminished. Chlorpromazine-induced hypothermia did not influence the antitumor effect of CAP-2. It may be concluded that the antileukemic synergism depends partially on the interaction between reserpine and CAP-2 or other antitumor agents in relation to body temperature and/or action on the central nervous system in leukemic mice.","['Miyamoto, K', 'Wakusawa, S', 'Koshura, R']","['Miyamoto K', 'Wakusawa S', 'Koshura R']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan,Gan,0151745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids)', '0 (Sympatholytics)', '81241-79-4 (1-(gamma-chloropropyl)-2-chloromethylpiperidine)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Body Temperature/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Reserpine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids/administration & dosage', 'Sympatholytics/administration & dosage']",1980/06/01 00:00,1980/06/01 00:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gan. 1980 Jun;71(3):408-14.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in seventeen patients (74%), were normal in six (26%), and were not decreased in any patient. The mean leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score was 166 (normal range, 11-95). High leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores correlated inversely with the absolute number of neutrophils in peripheral blood and were unrelated to other clinical factors, including age and time since splenectomy. High leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores were also associated with a shift to more immature forms of neutrophil differentiation. These findings are consistent with the view that high leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels in hairy cell leukemia are secondary to decreased marrow granulocyte reserves and do not necessarily indicate the existence of primary abnormalities of multiple bone marrow cell lines, including the granulocytes, in hairy cell leukemia. The role of the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase assay in the differential diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia with respect to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and other lymphoid malignancies is discussed.","['Aiba, M', 'Raffa, P P', 'Katayama, I']","['Aiba M', 'Raffa PP', 'Katayama I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Sex Factors', 'Splenectomy']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/74.3.297 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1980 Sep;74(3):297-300. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/74.3.297.,,3,,['RR05712/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we have found earlier, M. arthritidis enhanced endogenous colony formation in irradiated mice. In this paper we made an attempt to establish a connection between these two phenomena. The mixed inoculation of BALB/c mice with M. arthritidis and Rauscher leukemia virus produced a great increase in the number of endogenous colonies as compared with the effect of mycoplasmas alone, while Rauscher leukemia virus did not enhance the number of colonies. When injected into mice a day before their lethal irradiation, M. arthritidis was shown to increase the survival of mice within 30 days following irradiation. We tried to determine the possible mechanism of the effect of M. arthritidis on hemopoiesis. Our findings led us to the conclusion that the mycoplasmas had no influence on the splenic microenvironment and did not increase the migration of the surviving stem cells to the spleen. It is conceivable that M. arthritidis acts not on the pluripotent stem cells, but rather on the committed precursor cells. If so, the mechanism responsible for the enhancing effect of mycoplasmas on the development of Rauscher leukemia and endogenous colony formation resides possibly in the capacity of M. arthritidis to increase the number and/or sensitivity of target cells to the virus.","['Kaulen, D R', 'Sanin, A V', 'Khorobrykh, V V', 'Pronin, A V']","['Kaulen DR', 'Sanin AV', 'Khorobrykh VV', 'Pronin AV']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii i immunobiologii",0415217,,IM,"['Acholeplasma laidlawii', 'Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mycoplasmatales Infections/*complications/physiopathology', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Species Specificity']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol. 1980 May;(5):72-6.,,5,Simuliatsiia gemopoeza u myshei pod vliianiem Mycoplasma arthritidis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection of these mice with 10(4) focus-forming units of A-MuLV(M-MuLV) induced overt leukemia, detectable grossly or microscopically in 90% of the mice at 20-38 days. However, these methods did not detect leukemia at 17 days or before. Bone marrow cells from A-MuLV-infected leukemic or preleukemic mice were placed in tissue culture in a soft agarose gel. Cells from leukemic or preleukemic BALB/c mice grew to form colonies of 10(3) cells or more, composed of lymphoblasts, whereas marrow cells from normal uninfected mice did not. Cells from these colonies grew to form ascitic tumors after intraperitoneal inoculation into pristane-primed BALB/c recipients. Colony-forming leukemia cells could be detected in the marrow of A-MuLV-infected mice as early as 8 days after virus inoculation. The number of colony-forming leukemia cells increased as a function of time after virus inoculation. Colony-forming leukemia cells require other cells in order to replicate in tissue culture. Normal bone marrow cells, untreated or after treatment with mitomycin-C, provide this ""helper"" function. Only in the presence of untreated or mitomycin-C treated helper cells was the number of colonies approximately proportional to the number of leukemia cells plated. Marrow cells from leukemic BALB/c mice form more colonies than those from leukemic DBA/2 mice. The number of colonies formed per 10(3) microscopically identifiable leukemia cells plated was determined to be 2-3 for leukemic BALB/c mice and 0.3 for DBA/2 mice. Cocultivation of leukemic DBA/2 marrow cells with mitomycin-C treated normal BALB/c cells did not increase the number of colonies formed by the DBA/2 leukemic cells. Thus, the decreased ability of DBA/2 leukemia cells to form colonies appears to be a property of the leukemia cell population.","['Earl, C D', 'Scher, C D']","['Earl CD', 'Scher CD']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['0 (Mitomycins)'],IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Preleukemia/pathology']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041040204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1980 Aug;104(2):153-62. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041040204.,,2,,['CA 18662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predominant translation products after a 1-h labeling period were three precursor polypeptides of Mr 77000, 75000 and 65000. Following longer labeling periods the most stable precursor polypeptide of Mr 65000 was most prominent. In addition, several intermediates of Mr 35000--60000 were observed. After about 24 h, mature viral core proteins appeared. The rate of synthesis of the 75000-Mr and 77000-Mr viral proteins decreased gradually after injection, suggesting that viral core polypeptides somehow regulated processing or synthesis of the group-specific antigen precursors.

Its application is limited to trials where (a) the result of therapy is easily defined, (b) the result of therapy is discernible in a short time interval, and (c) one randomization is being tested, although patients may be stratified. The main disadvantage of sequential design is that if the therapies being tested are similar in efficacy, the trial may require more patients than fixed-sample analysis.

The time course of emergence of resistance of the treated cell lines was studied both in vivo and in vitro. When used as a single drug, in vivo resistance to MTX developed gradually and was considerable at eight passages and complete by 11 passages. Complete in vivo resistance to DDMP used alone occurred by the fifth passage. Complete in vivo resistance to the drugs in combination was seen by the eighth passage. In cells demonstrating complete DDMP resistance, as determined in vivo, there was no evidence of cross-resistance to MTX measured either in vivo or in vitro, while MTX resistance was associated with incomplete cross-resistance to DDMP. The greatest degree of resistance, as determined in vitro, occurred in the cell line treated with the drug combination. In vitro tests of drug resistance correlated well with in vivo survival data. An important observation was that major in vivo drug resistance was accompanied by only a small measurable effect using standard in vitro screening techniques.

Surface-adherent monocytes were not detected in the peripheral blood nor were monocytes that mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to isoantibody-coated human erythrocytes. In addition, lymphocytes of both patients failed to show blastogenic responses to concanavalin A (Con-A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) but showed a vigorous response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Other immunologic abnormalities were present but were either moderate in degree or were not present in both patients. In vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses were fully restored by incubation of patients' leukocytes with a normal donor's adherent monocytes. One patient received daily allogeneic leukocyte transfusion for 4 days. This resulted in complete normalization of monocyte adherence and ADCC that persisted for several months after transfusion and was associated with hemotalogic improvement. Therapy in case 1 resulted in correction of the blastogenic responses to Con-A and PWM. Thus, a host defense defect in hairy cell leukemia has been defined in 2 patients and a preliminary result suggests that therapy with leukocyte transfusions may be useful in the postsplenectomy patient with an infectious complication and should be explored further.","['Hersh, E M', 'Murphy, S', 'Zander, A', 'Dicke, K', 'Stewart, D J', 'Toki, H', 'Latreille, J']","['Hersh EM', 'Murphy S', 'Zander A', 'Dicke K', 'Stewart DJ', 'Toki H', 'Latreille J']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70550-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Sep;56(3):526-33.,,3,,"['05831/PHS HHS/United States', '14984/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several investigators have selected variant tumour cell lines with enhanced capacity to metastasize to specific organs, mainly using the spontaneously originating B16 melanoma cell line of the mouse and tumour variants with enhanced capacity to metastasize to the lungs, brain and liver. We previously reported the derivation of a liver-specific metastatic variant of a Marek's disease (MD) virus-transformed, non-producer lymphoma cell line. MD is a naturally occurring, herpes virus-induced, T-cell lymphoma of chickens which bears pathological and aetiological similarities to Burkitt's lymphoma in man. This makes MD a useful model for study. One similarity is the pattern of metastasis in which both lymphomas induce a high incidence of ovarian and liver lesions.

Based on the affinity between mercurated cDNA and sulphydryl-Sepharose, the hybrid was specifically selected by affinity column chromatography. The specificity of this method was dependent on the purity of the cDNA and it was necessary to remove non-viral sequences from the cDNA in order to isolate virus-specific RNA.

Using this methodology, the effect of the cell cycle on the transcriptional activity of proviral genes was investigated. Cultures of Moloney MuLV-infected rat cells arrested in Go phase of the cell cycle released reduced quantities of virus, but continued to synthesize virus RNA. The pools of virus RNA and p30 antigen in the Go-arrested cells equalled the pools in actively dividing cells.

Unlike their heterozygote (hr/+) littermates, hr/hr homozygotes express high levels of xenotropic virus during the preleukemic period, and viruses with a broadened host range (termed polytropic viruses) can be isolated from their preleukemic and leukemic tissues. Because hr/hr and hr/+ mice are otherwise genetically identical, the virological differences between them support the role of polytropic viruses in the generation of thymic leukemia. In the present report we show that the HRS/J polytropic viruses are env gene recombinants with unique oligonucleotide and peptide maps. These polytropic viruses appear to arise by recombination between ecotropic virus and an unidentified genome related, but not identical to, the endogenous xenotropic viruses. Moreover, polytropic viruses not only accelerate leukemogenesis in HRS/J mice, but also induce thymic leukemia in the low leukemia strain CBA/J.

(1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 97, 133-139], we showed that a nuclear fraction released from chromatin under a mild nuclease digestion contained an increased amount of hnRNA and the bulk of nonhistone proteins with a high metabolic rate. The present investigation has revealed that the nonhistone proteins of this fraction could be divided into three distinct metabolic groups. The first group consists of proteins with a fast turnover rate (mean half-life 30 min) which migrate into chromatin immediately after their synthesis. These proteins are predominantly acid-soluble and have relatively high molecular weights. The second group includes proteins which migrate to the nucleus more slowly and metabolize with a moderate turnover rate (mean half-life 5 h). The third group contains proteins with a more conservative metabolic behaviour. In experiments with actinomycin D it was found that the bulk of the nonhistone proteins of this fraction are not real components of the chromatin but belong to the protein moiety of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles associated with chromatin.","['Djondjurov, L', 'Ivanova, E', 'Pironcheva, G', 'Tsanev, R']","['Djondjurov L', 'Ivanova E', 'Pironcheva G', 'Tsanev R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Heterogeneous Nuclear/metabolism']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1980.tb04630.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1980;107(1):105-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1980.tb04630.x.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expected inflammatory reactions to infection were absent in most of these immunosuppressed patients. Nonspecific pathologic changes were found in 40%, of which diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial pneumonitis were the most common. The mortality was highest for Group I patients with infections (50%) and with diffuse alveolar damage (56%). In Group II patients specific diagnoses were made in only 7%, although histologic abnormalities were found in an additional 61%. This study emphasizes several important differences which should be considered in evaluating transbronchial lung biopsies from immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed patients. This biopsy procedure is most useful in diagnosing infection in immunosuppressed patients but the histology may be difficult to interpret since the usual inflammatory reactions are often absent. This procedure is also useful in evaluating nonimmunosuppressed patients, although open biopsy may be necessary when clinical and pathologic features do not correlate.","['Katzenstein, A L', 'Askin, F B']","['Katzenstein AL', 'Askin FB']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,IM,"['Biopsy/*methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Pneumonia/pathology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/pathology']",1980/06/01 00:00,1980/06/01 00:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-198006000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1980 Jun;4(3):223-34. doi: 10.1097/00000478-198006000-00002.,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nineteen patients received chemotherapy and were studied serially with the PCC technique. Of the 19 patients in this pilot study, 14 relapsed, and the PCC technique predicted relapse in 11 of these 14. The median time from an elevation in the fraction of G1 cells in the late G1 phase (a high proliferative-potential index) to the development of clinical evidence of relapse was 3.5 months. On the other hand, the median time from a low proliferative-potential index to relapse or to the end of the study was eight months. The incidense of false-positive or false-negative measurements was low. Two patients had high index values just before chemotherapy, and remission was estimated to be prolonged by 2.5 and six months by our therapeutic protocol. These results suggest that the PCC technique is useful and accurate in the early prediction of relapse in human leukemia.","['Hittelman, W N', 'Broussard, L C', 'Dosik, G', 'McCredie, K B']","['Hittelman WN', 'Broussard LC', 'Dosik G', 'McCredie KB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Cell Fusion', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Time Factors']",1980/08/28 00:00,1980/08/28 00:01,['1980/08/28 00:00'],"['1980/08/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198008283030902 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1980 Aug 28;303(9):479-84. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198008283030902.,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further characterization of protecting cell population.,715-8,"Spleen cells from 8-week-old, nonimmunized donor chickens can transfer resistance to a supralethal dose of the JMV leukemia line of Marek's disease (MD) to newly hatched, highly susceptible, histocompatible recipients. The population of cells transferring resistance has previously been shown to be non-T, non-B, and nonmacrophage in nature. We present data here showing that heavily x-irradiated spleen cells were unable to protect recipients from leukemia challenge. Both complement receptor-bearing and -lacking cells could confer resistance to newly hatched recipients. Fc receptor-bearing cells conferred significant protection to recipients, whereas spleen cells depleted of Fc receptor-bearing cells were unable to protect chickens from death after JMV challenge. This indicates that the population of spleen cells, which is moderately radiosensitive and which possesses Fc receptors, is responsible for the transfer of natural resistance to the malignancy in vivo.","['Lam, K M', 'Linna, T J']","['Lam KM', 'Linna TJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Marek Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Receptors, Complement', 'Receptors, Fc', 'Rosette Formation', 'Spleen/*cytology', 'X-Rays']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1980 Aug;125(2):715-8.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oligomers were tested in vivo using passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and in vitro by measuring their capacity to induce histamine release from normal rat mast cells and [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. The PCA results confirmed previous work that showed no large differences in the activity of dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers of IgE. The same was also true with normal rat mast cells; however, the RBL cells sharply discriminated between the variously sized oligomers. The stimulatory activity of all oligomers on the RBL cells was enhanced by D2O. The findings imply that the manner by which the clustering of the receptors for IgE leads to generation of signals in RBL cells involves a mechanism capable of discriminating between a variety of polymeric states of the receptors. In addition, our results suggest that no more than a few hundred trimers or an even smaller number of higher oligomers are capable of inducing a considerable amount of secretion from these cells.","['Fewtrell, C', 'Metzger, H']","['Fewtrell C', 'Metzger H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '29878-26-0 (Dimethyl Suberimidate)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Basophils', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dimethyl Suberimidate/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1980 Aug;125(2):701-10.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The negative variants are cloned, cultured cells obtained from the Thy-1.2(theta) positive BALB/c lymphoma RL male 1 in a single-step immunoselection procedure. The reduction appears to be related to an alteration in the host response to the tumor, since both the variant and parental cells induce tumors equally well in irradiated mice. Males are much more susceptible to the inoculated tumor cells, suggesting that the relevant response is restricted to females. A majority of female animals that survive challenge with the variant do not allow growth of the parental tumor when they are injected with a quantity of cells that is uniformly fatal in untreated recipients. Most of the surviving females have an antibody in their sera that is cytotoxic for the variant, its parent, and normal thymocytes.

It is also demonstrated that both chicken liver and beef liver dihydrofolate reductases (and perhaps all of the animal dihydrofolate reductases) contain a single sulfhydryl group within the 11 or so amino acids of the NH2-terminal sequence and that this is the site of mercurial interaction and activation.

Leukemic blasts from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia lacked both Fc receptors and surface immunoglobulin and did not migrate towards chemoattractants. Leukemic blasts from patients with acute monocytic leukemia, however, demonstrated heterogeneity with regard to Fc receptors, surface immunoglobulins and chemotaxis, and could be divided into three groups: in group I, leukemic blasts which lacked both Fc receptors and surface immunoglobulin moved poorly; in group II, large proportions of leukemic blasts and Fc receptors but lacked surface immunoglobulins. These blasts migrated well towards the chemoattractants, and in group III, leukemic blasts which had both Fc receptors and surface immunoglobulins lacked chemotactic property. A correlation between the presence or absence of Fc receptors and chemotaxis was observed.

In this study, we investigated the effects of lithocholic acid on the DNA of mouse lymphoblastoma L1210 cells. Incubation of L1210 cells with lithocholic acid (2.5 X 10(-4) M) at 37 degrees for 30 min and for 1 hr resulted in the appearance of single-strand breaks in the DNA. This was demonstrated by sedimentation of nucleoids in neutral sucrose gradients and by alkaline elution. The DNA damage was repaired upon incubation of the cells in fresh medium lacking lithocholic acid. These results suggest that DNA repair efficiency is an important function for the population of cells which are constantly exposed to low concentrations of lithocholic acid. The presence of even a low level of persistent damage could lead to significant biological consequences including mutations and the induction of error-prone repair processes.","['Kulkarni, M S', 'Heidepriem, P M', 'Yielding, K L']","['Kulkarni MS', 'Heidepriem PM', 'Yielding KL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5QU0I8393U (Lithocholic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA, Neoplasm', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics', 'Lithocholic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight']",1980/08/01 00:00,1980/08/01 00:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Aug;40(8 Pt 1):2666-9.,,8 Pt 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of release of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide from monomeric and polymeric derivatives was examined under physiological conditions (pH 7.0, 37.0 degrees) in vitro. Hydrophobicity and length of alkyl chain of substituents at the 4-position of the phosphamide ring decreased the rate of hydrolysis. The polymeric derivatives were more slowly hydrolyzed than were their corresponding monomers. Toxicity in mice indicated that the rate of hydrolysis in vitro is related to toxicity in vivo. The optimal antitumor activity (maximum 270% increase in life span in L1210-bearing mice) and effective dose range of each derivative of low molecular weight were similar to cyclophosphamide. The polymeric derivatives exhibited much less antitumor activity (maximum 50% increase in the life span) than did cyclophosphamide. The short-alkyl-chain monomeric derivatives such as propanol and propionic acid caused acute lethal toxicity, which limited the upper dose usable for antitumor activity. Polymeric derivatives, when compared on a molar basis to their corresponding monomers, were relatively more toxic to the mice which limited their maximum dose.","['Hirano, T', 'Ringsdorf, H', 'Zaharko, D S']","['Hirano T', 'Ringsdorf H', 'Zaharko DS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Body Weight', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Hydrolysis', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Jul;40(7):2263-7.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bromodeoxyuridine density-labeled DNA and normal DNA were isolated by sedimentation in a cesium chloride density gradient and analyzed for the level of globin-specific DNA by hybridization with radioactive cDNA of the globin messenger RNA. Globin genes were found to be replicated near the end of the middle third of the S phase. The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA also resulted in a lowered induction of hemoglobin synthesis in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells. In this case, the sensitivity was correlated with the introduction of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA replicated in early S phase. The possibility that this fraction of DNA, which is low in globin gene content, carries genes regulating the erythroid differentiation or the expression of globin genes is discussed.","['Lo, S C', 'Ross, J', 'Mueller, G C']","['Lo SC', 'Ross J', 'Mueller GC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', '*Genes', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', '*Interphase', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1980/06/27 00:00,1980/06/27 00:01,['1980/06/27 00:00'],"['1980/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2787(80)90138-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(80)90138-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Jun 27;608(1):103-11. doi: 10.1016/0005-2787(80)90138-0.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qualitative differences in tissues and changes in methylation of repeating sequences during aging, carcinogenesis and hormonal induction].",357-68,"5-methylcytosine (m5C) is nonrandomly distributed in mammalian genome. The unique sequences in DNA of all species studied (mouse, rat, cow) methylated to a similar extent and are characterized by a minimal m5C content (0.8--0.9 mole%). The very renaturating sequences (including satellite DNA) possess a maximal m5C amount. The rarely repeated (10 to 1000 folds) sequences which are known to contain genes for rRNA and tRNA as well as for histones are characterized by an elevated level of methylation. It is established that tissue differences in m5C content in DNA as well as decrease in the DNA methylation level with age and on spontaneous lympholeukosis in cattle and, on the contrary, increase in DNA methylation degree in rat liver as a result of induction with hydrocortisone, are due to tissue specific changes in the methylation level of repeated but not unique sequences. The methylation level of sequences differing in the reiteration degree seems to be mainly due to CG-dublet frequencies. In the unique sequences this particular dinucleotide is almost completely methylated. Nevertheless, the multiplicity of DNA methylases in the animal nucleus is not ruled out. Methylation of the CG sequence is supposed to protect animal DNA's, especially structural genes, against restriction endonucleases. The decrease in DNA methylation in animals with age and on lympholeukosis detected by us is considered to be one of the possible reasons for chromosome lesions and for distortions in DNA replication and transcription.","['Romanov, G A', 'Vaniushin, B F']","['Romanov GA', 'Vaniushin BF']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis', '*DNA/analysis/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/analysis', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Renaturation', 'Organ Specificity', 'Rats']",1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 1980 Mar-Apr;14(2):357-68.,,2,"Vnutrigenomnaia spetsifichnost' metilirovaniia DNK u zhivotnykh.

When Ga-67 solutions were centrifuged to separate the precipitate, the highest precipitated radioactivity was found at the stated pH. With the addition of chelating agents which interact strongly with gallium, the adsorption to either cells or a glass surface was stoichiometrically inhibited. No such inhibition occurred, however, when counter ions unbound to gallium were added. The amount of Ga-67 released from the cell depended on the pH, suggesting that most of the gallium is deposited on the cell surface.

Hydroxyurea (HU) was administered by continuous iv infusion 5 days after tumor implantation. Perturbation effects on the S-phase cells were measured by serial tritiated thymidine labeling indices. Effects on cell-cycle progression were measured by DNA content distribution analysis using flow cytometry. Synchronization of tumor cells was achieved with HU infusion (48 mg/kg/hour x 24 hours), resulting in 90% of the cells in S phase. Following infusion, synchronous progression of S-phase cells into G2/M and then G1 was apparent from +0 to +10 hours later. The susceptibility of HU-synchronized cells to subsequent chemotherapy was determined by treating mice with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), methotrexate (MTX), or Adriamycin (ADR) pulse doses at various intervals following infusion. Synergy, measured by prolongation of survival times, resulted when Ara-C was administered immediately after the end of the infusion. Survival times then decreased as the fraction of cells in S phase decreased. In contrast, the survival times of mice treated with MTX or ADR pulse doses after HU infusion were additive at best and did not correlate with fluctuations in the S phase compartment. Therefore, prior synchronization of tumor cells in S phase was therapeutically advantageous when coupled with appropriately timed Ara-C pulse doses. There was little advantage in combining HU infusion with subsequent MTX or ADR therapy.","['Moran, R E', 'Straus, M J']","['Moran RE', 'Straus MJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1980 Jan;64(1):81-6.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In RBL-1 cells, prostaglandin D2 is isomerase activity was found in the 150 000 X g microsomal pellet as well as the supernatant fraction. Incubation of RBL-1 microsomes with arachidonic acid without cofactors yielded 17.5 +/- 2% prostaglandin E2 and 9.1 +/- 1.4% prostaglandin D2. The cyclooxygenase activity was enhanced (25%) by epinephrine and the addition of reduced glutathione led to a marked increase in prostaglandin D2 synthesis (3-fold). Incubations with arachidonic acid, glutathione and epinephrine gave the maximum conversion to prostaglandin D2, yielding 7 +/- 0.4% prostaglandin E2 and 35.6 +/- 3.5% prostaglandin D2. Incubations with [14C]prostaglandin H2 to bypass cyclooxygenase confirmed the presence and glutathione dependence of the prostaglandin D2 isomerase in the microsomal fraction and also revealed the presence of the same enzyme in the 150 000 X g supernant. In contrast to RBL-1 cells, incubations of microsomes and supernatant from normal rat mast cells with [14C]-arachidonic acid and [14C]prostaglandin H2 localized the prostaglandin D2 isomerase activity in the soluble fraction.

Most of the small intestinal lesions, which usually were multicentric, metastasized. When metastases were absent or confined to regional lymph nodes, surgical excision alone provided satisfactory long-term therapy. When the disease involved the liver, the course until death was usually long but inexorable unless chemotherapy was used. During follow-up, which averaged more than six years, no carcinoid of the appendix, rectum, or lung recurred or metastasized after surgical extirpation. Other neoplasms, including adenocarcinomas of the rectum, appendix, prostate, and nasopharynx and acute granulocytic leukemia, appeared in six patients, which extends previous observations that patients with carcinoids have a neoplastic diathesis.","['Wood, E R', 'Wood, W G']","['Wood ER', 'Wood WG']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Appendiceal Neoplasms/surgery', 'Carcinoid Tumor/pathology/secondary/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileal Neoplasms/surgery', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Jejunal Neoplasms/surgery', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/pathology/secondary', 'Rectal Neoplasms/surgery']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007611-198005000-00021 [doi]'],ppublish,South Med J. 1980 May;73(5):621-6. doi: 10.1097/00007611-198005000-00021.,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients without documented infection who did not respond to antibiotics and whose fever developed after a course of cytotoxic drugs, were given the provision of high dose corticosteroid therapy. Infection was documented microbiologically or clinically in 13/29 episodes. Septicaemia was proven in 7, and 6 had pneumonia. Neutropenia was present in 18/29 episodes. A satisfactory response to initial therapy was achieved in 7/13 with documented infection and in 9/16 without proven infection. The overall good response was 55%, 5/7 cases with septicaemia, but only 2/6 with pneumonia responded well. The 2 septicaemia patients who did not respond had Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. In 16 episodes without documented infection 7 did not respond to initial therapy. To 4 of them, who were subject to recent cytotoxic drug administration, high dose corticosteroid therapy was given, and 3 of them responded well. Of the remaining 3 non-responders, one became afebrile after cytostatic and one after prednisolone treatment. Serum assays of tobramycin were done on the 1st and 5th day of therapy and no difference in concentration was observed on these 2 occasions. Five patients developed renal failure, but this was attributed to antibiotic therapy only in 1, who initially had an elevated serum creatinine. It is concluded, that in hospitals where pseudomonas is not a dominating pathogen, tobramycin--cephalothin may be a good combination to start empiric therapy with. In patients without proven infection, who have recently been subjected to cytotoxic therapy, and who do not respond to the initial course of antibiotics, a high dose of corticosteroids may be tried, provided the patient is monitored for the hazard of bacterial infection.","['Hjorth, M', 'Weinfeld, A', 'Brorson, J E']","['Hjorth M', 'Weinfeld A', 'Brorson JE']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'R72LW146E6 (Cephalothin)', 'VZ8RRZ51VK (Tobramycin)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Cephalothin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sepsis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Tobramycin/blood/*therapeutic use']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/inf.1980.12.issue-2.13 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 1980;12(2):139-48. doi: 10.3109/inf.1980.12.issue-2.13.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The short and long term prognosis is usually difficult to predict in the individual case. In the present work the proliferative activity in peripheral CLL cells of 38 patients was analysed by 3H-thymidine uptake and a proliferative index (PI = labelling index x white blood cell count/1 x 10(-9)) was calculated. A strong correlation between PI and clinical disease activity was found. Thus 22 out of 23 patients with non-progressive disease had normal values (PI less than 10). 8 out of 8 cases with PI greater than 20 had a clear disease progression in all blood variables. The PI interval 10--20 comprised both patients with progressive and patients with non-progressive disease. Variations in PI correlated well to variations in clinical disease activity in 8 patients examined at intervals during long term treatment. The results indicate that determination of PI might be used as therapy guide since it was normalized during successful treatment.,"['Simonsson, B', 'Nilsson, K']","['Simonsson B', 'Nilsson K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1980.tb02363.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1980 Feb;24(2):169-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1980.tb02363.x.,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phorbol esters, on the other hand, are potent inhibitors of both spontaneous and induced cellular differentiation. We therefore investigated the relationship between the potency of compounds to induce erythroid differentiation in FL cells and their potency to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation induced by PMA and other mitogens. We report here that many of the compounds that induce erythroid differentiation in FL cells are similar to DMSO in selectively suppressing PMA-induced lymphocyte mitogenesis.","['Stenzel, K H', 'Schwartz, R', 'Rubin, A L', 'Novogrodsky, A']","['Stenzel KH', 'Schwartz R', 'Rubin AL', 'Novogrodsky A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitogens', 'Phorbols/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1980/05/08 00:00,1980/05/08 00:01,['1980/05/08 00:00'],"['1980/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/285106a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1980 May 8;285(5760):106-8. doi: 10.1038/285106a0.,,5760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeast amber suppressor tRNA (amber tRNA) enhanced the synthesis of the Rauscher murine leukemia virus and clone 1 Moloney murine leukemia virus Pr200(gag-pol) polypeptides by 10- to 45-fold, but at the same time depressed the synthesis of Rauscher murine leukemia virus Pr65(gag) and Moloney murine leukemia virus Pr63(gag). Under suppressor-minus conditions, Moloney murine leukemia virus Pr70(gag) was present as a closely spaced doublet. Amber tRNA stimulated the synthesis of the ""upper"" Moloney murine leukemia virus Pr70(gag) polypeptide. Yeast ochre suppressor tRNA appeared to be ineffective. Quantitative analyses of the kinetics of viral precursor polypeptide accumulation in the presence of amber tRNA showed that during linear protein synthesis, the increase in accumulated Moloney murine leukemia virus Pr200(gag-pol) coincided closely with the molar loss of Pr63(gag). Enhancement of Pr200(gag-pol) and Pr70(gag) by amber tRNA persisted in the presence of pactamycin, a drug which blocks the initiation of protein synthesis, thus arguing for the addition of amino acids to the C terminus of Pr63(gag) as the mechanism behind the amber tRNA effect. Moloney murine sarcoma virus 124 30S RNA was translated into four major polypeptides, Pr63(gag), P42, P38, and P23. In the presence of amber tRNA, a new polypeptide, Pr67(gag), appeared, whereas Pr63(gag) synthesis was decreased. Quantitative estimates indicated that for every 1 mol of Pr67(gag) which appeared, 1 mol of Pr63(gag) was lost.","['Murphy, E C Jr', 'Wills, N', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Murphy EC Jr', 'Wills N', 'Arlinghaus RB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Peptide Chain Termination, Translational/drug effects', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Transfer/*genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', '*Suppression, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis']",1980/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.34.2.464-473.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1980 May;34(2):464-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.34.2.464-473.1980.,,2,,,PMC288725,,,,,,,,,,,,

BALB/Mo mice, which carry M-MuLV as an endogenous virus at a single Mendelian locus, were used to examine the genetically transmitted viral genome copy and additional M-MuLV sequences acquired somatically during leukemogenesis. It has been shown previously that M-MuLV genome expression in these mice is restricted to lymphatic target tissues. In young homozygous BALB/Mo mice carrying one M-MuLV genome copy per haploid mouse genome in all cells we found that the genetically transmitted viral genome copy was in a preferentially DNase I-sensitive conformation in lymphatic target tissues, whereas in nontarget tissues the same sequence was not preferentially DNase I sensitive. This suggests that the chromatin conformation and the transcriptional activity of the integrated proviral genome are related to and probably determined by the state of cellular differentiation. In target tissues from BALB/Mo mice examined at different ages and in different stages of leukemogenesis the majority of the new somatically acquired M-MuLV sequences were preferentially DNase I digestible. A very similar pattern of DNase I digestibility was observed in target tissues from BALB/c mice exogenously infected with M-MuLV. This shows that in these tissues somatically acquired proviral sequences integrate preferentially or exclusively at sites of the host genome in which they are in a transcriptionally active chromatin conformation. Alternatively, the chromatin structure of the respective host genome region may be changed after the integration of viral DNA. In nontarget tissues from BALB/Mo mice the M-MuLV-specific sequences remained DNase I resistant throughout the lives of the animals. A different pattern of DNase I digestibility was observed in virus-infected cell lines which had been produced by low-multiplicity infection, cloned, and selected for virus production. When cell lines harboring different numbers of M-MuLV proviral copies were examined, it was found that a minority of the proviral sequences (on the average only one M-MuLV genome copy per haploid mouse genome) were preferentially digestible by DNase I, independent of the total number of proviral genome copies present. This suggests that the chromatin conformation of newly acquired proviral sequences is influenced by the state of differentiation of the infected cell or the way infected cells are selected or both.","['Breindl, M', 'Bacheler, L', 'Fan, H', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Breindl M', 'Bacheler L', 'Fan H', 'Jaenisch R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Chromatin', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleases/pharmacology', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Protein Conformation', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.34.2.373-382.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1980 May;34(2):373-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.34.2.373-382.1980.,,2,,,PMC288715,,,,,,,,,,,,
