Although the percentage of patients acquiring any infection was similar in the transfusion and control groups (46 and 42 per cent, respectively), granulocyte transfusions decreased the proportion of patients with bacterial septicemia (9 per cent of those with transfusions vs. 27 per cent of the controls; P = 0.01). Granulocyte transfusions did not reduce the incidence of other infections or improve bone-marrow recovery, remission rate and duration, or survival. Seventy-two per cent of the patients given transfusions had transfusion reactions.

Immature hemopoietic cells can adhere on to marrow-derived fibroblast cells, whereas mature granulocytes cannot.

Effect of pH and metabolic inhibition.,363-8,"Previous experiments on the functional properties of rat basophilic leukaemia cells showed a major anomaly when compared to normal mast cells: though IgE-mediated secretion was dependent on external Ca2+ with both types of cells, substantial non-cytotoxic release with ionophore A23187 could be demonstrated with the normal cells but not with the tumour cells. We now show that when the pH of the incubation medium is increased to 8 it is possible to obtain excellent Ca-dependent, non-cytotoxic secretion from tumour basophils with the ionophores A23187 and ionomycin. These results provide further evidence that secretion from the tumour cells occurs via a mechanism similar to that used by normal mast cells and basophils. Experiments with metabolically inhibited tumour cells suggest that their unusual sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of Ca2+ ionophores may be related to their ability to sequester intracellular calcium. Changes in the conditions of cell culture appeared to produce substantial and at least partially reversible changes in responsiveness to IgE-mediated triggering and ionophores.","['Fewtrell, C', 'Lagunoff, D', 'Metzger, H']","['Fewtrell C', 'Lagunoff D', 'Metzger H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Ionomycin', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism']",,1981/06/22 00:00,1981/06/22 00:01,['1981/06/22 00:00'],"['1981/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(81)90394-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(81)90394-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 Jun 22;644(2):363-8. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(81)90394-1.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Ionophores)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']","['HL-03714/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-23593/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The data here indicate that membrane preparations from RL sigma 1 leukemia targets, EL-4 lymphoma targets, and P815 mastocytoma targets each inhibited binding of its homologous target to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-activated murine macrophages in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar amounts of membrane from lymphocytes did not alter binding of the three neoplastic target to BCG-macrophages. Membranes of the three targets also inhibited binding of the heterologous neoplastic targets. Inhibitory activity of membrane preparations from P815, EL-4, and RL sigma 1 targets could be adsorbed by incubation of limiting concentrations of the membrane preparations with BCG-activated macrophages but not with thioglycollate broth-elicited macrophages. Exposure of BCG macrophages to membrane preparations from RL sigma 1, FL-4, or P815 targets inhibited subsequent cytolysis of the three targets.

Effect of passively administered antibody on growth of transplanted tumor cells.,805-10,"The objective of the present study was to establish a model system for the evaluation of passive immunotherapy of murine leukemias. Monoclonal antibodies directed at T lymphocyte differentiation antigens (Thy 1 and Lyt 2) were tested for their effect on tumors that were grown in hosts congenic for the target antigen. Tumor challenges were selected that were at least 500 times the dose that was lethal in 50% of untreated controls. The A strain leukemia, ASL.1, was transplanted subcutaneously into a/Thy 1.1 congenic hosts. Intraperitoneal administration of anti-Thy 1.2 monoclonal antibodies of the IgG3 and IgM classes reduced tumor growth. Up to 90% of the mice receiving antibody of the IgG3 subclass failed to develop tumors, whereas IgM antibodies prolonged survival time, but the mice eventually died of tumors. Antibody was most effective if administered within 24 hr of tumor inoculation; delay of antibody injection for 48 hr prolonged host survival but did not eradicate cells at the injection site or prevent metastases. The C57BL/6-derived tumors, ERLD and EL4, were evaluated for susceptibility to treatment with antibody directed at the Lyt 2.2 alloantigen using the protocol that was effective in treating aSL.1. Monoclonal antibody of the IgG2a subclass was effective in the case of C57BL/6/Lyt 2.1 congenic mice bearing ERLD, but caused a decrease in survival time of mice bearing the transplanted EL4 tumor. Thus, antibody of the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass can be effective in controlling tumor growth if administered in the optimal treatment regimen, but inherent features of the tumor cell ultimately determine whether abrogation or enhancement of growth will occur.","['Kirch, M E', 'Hammerling, U']","['Kirch ME', 'Hammerling U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Maternally-Acquired', 'Immunoglobulins/classification', 'Immunotherapy', 'Isoantibodies', 'Leukemia, Experimental/mortality/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Time Factors']",,1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Aug;127(2):805-10.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']","['AI 14831/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Although optimal conditions for the production of MCGF in CM are identical to those for the production of T cell growth factor (TCGF), MCGF can be dissociated from TCGF after the first stage of purification on a DEAE-cellulose column. MCGF elutes from the column in the breakthrough fraction, whereas TCGF binds avidly to DEAE and is eluted only at high salt concentration. MCGF also differs from TCGF with respect to m.w. (as estimated by Sephadex G-150 chromatography) and sensitivity to trypsin. In addition, MCGF is produced by the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 and the radiation induced thymic lymphoma LBRM-33 cells, whereas TCGF is produced only by the latter in the presence of a mitogen. Another hemopoietically active factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) present in media conditioned by WEHI-3 and LBRM-33 cells, however, shares a number of properties with MCGF. Although studies with purified or partially purified MCGF have thus far failed to reveal a correlation between MCGF and G-CSF, further biochemical analyses are necessary to dissociate MCGF from G-CSF.","['Yung, Y P', 'Eger, R', 'Tertian, G', 'Moore, M A']","['Yung YP', 'Eger R', 'Tertian G', 'Moore MA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Male', '*Mast Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Time Factors']",,1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Aug;127(2):794-9.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Four months after diagnosis all three had fallen significantly, but this tendency stopped after six months.

The third factor in the preclinical evaluation of the bis-diketopiperazines that may have clinical application is the evidence that suggests that these drugs have an antimetastatic effect.","['Poster, D S', 'Penta, J S', 'Bruno, S', 'Macdonald, J S']","['Poster DS', 'Penta JS', 'Bruno S', 'Macdonald JS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Clin Trials,Cancer clinical trials,7905482,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Dogs', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Razoxane/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Clin Trials. 1981;4(2):143-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)']",,,19,,,,,,

It was derived from a fusion of the NS-1 plasmacytoma cell line with spleen cells from a mouse immunized with human acute monoblastic leukemia cells. The antibody reacts weakly with viable monocytes in suspension but has specificity for fibrous projections, which are found on monocytes that have adhered to substrate. Other hemopoietically derived cells such as granulocytes and lymphocytes, and many tissue-culture lines, do not react with UC45 by cell-surface immunofluorescence. Similarly, UC45 reacts with the processes of both viable CNS and PNS neurons in tissue culture but with no other neural-tissue-derived cells. The monoclonal antibody has interspecies reactivity, in that it reacts with human, rat and mouse monocytes and neurons. The monocytes and neuronal antigen is present predominantly on a protein of 45 kd. Attempts to identify this protein on monocytes with conventional heteroantisera directed against fibronectin, complement components, fibrinogen, collagen, tubulin and actin have failed. A monoclonal antibody has therefore allowed identification of an antigen, unexpectedly shared by monocytes and neurons. The fact that it is found on cell processes of both cell types suggests that it may be performing some similar function for these cells, whose other activities differ substantially.","['Hogg, N', 'Slusarenko, M', 'Cohen, J', 'Reiser, J']","['Hogg N', 'Slusarenko M', 'Cohen J', 'Reiser J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neurons/*immunology', 'Rats']",,1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(81)90113-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90113-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 Jun;24(3):875-84. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90113-6.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,

Six of the seven cell lines released galactosyltransferase into their culture media. Only the human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells failed to release demonstrable galactosyltransferase activity. Release of galactosyltransferase activity into the media closely paralleled the growth curves for all but the BHKpy cells. These cells continued to release peak levels of galactosyltransferase activity into the culture media after their growth had plateaued. Media galactosyltransferase activity was unaffected by Triton X-100 treatment had remained in the supernatant fraction of a 100,000 X g, 12-hr centrifugation, suggesting that the cells release galactosyltransferase in a soluble form. In contrast to galactosyltransferase activity, only one of the cell lines (L1210) released sialyltransferase activity in appreciable amounts. Even this level of activity was 20-fold less than that observed for galactosyltransferase in the media from L1210 cells. Of the nine glycosidase activities assayed, only N-acetylglucosaminidase was observed in significant amounts in the media from all but the CCRF-CEM cells. However, N-acetylglucosaminidase release did not correlate closely with cell growth. These findings suggest a relatively specific release of galactosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities by cells in tissue culture. Moreover, the release of galactosyltransferase closely parallels cell growth. The significance of these released enzymes, especially to cell growth, has yet to be determined.","['Klohs, W D', 'Mastrangelo, R', 'Weiser, M M']","['Klohs WD', 'Mastrangelo R', 'Weiser MM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Culture Media', 'Galactosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Hexosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Lung', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Rats', 'Sialyltransferases/metabolism']",,1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Jul;41(7):2611-5.,"['0 (Culture Media)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Hexosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)']",['CA25074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Four of the 6 positive B-CLL cases were in ""prolymphocytoid"" transformation; two of them had bright membrane Ig (SmIg) staining and may represent an intermediate form between B-CLL and B-PLL. Although there was a tendency for the intensity of the immunofluorescence reaction with FMC7 and SmIg to change in parallel, FMC7 did not correlate with any Ig class. In addition, almost all FMC7-negative B-CLL had weak expression of SmIg. FMC7 is different from other monoclonal antibodies raised against B-lineage cells in that it recognizes only some subsets, presumably those at a late stage of maturation.

At the same time a testicular biopsy was performed in each boy and the morphology was studied. Histologically the chemotherapy appeared to damage the tubular system in particular, and the degree of damage was assessed by estimating the tubular fertility (TF) index which is defined as the percentage of seminiferous tubules containing identifiable spermatogonia. The mean TF index in all 44 biopsies was 51%. Only 2 of the 44 boys showed an absent or blunted testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotrophin. This suggests that Leydig cell function is rarely impaired by such chemotherapy and that most of the boys, similarly treat for ALL, will undergo normal pubertal maturation. Apart from the basal luteinising hormone (LH) levels in the prepubertal group which could not be compared, the median basal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, and testosterone concentrations, the median peak FSH and LH responses to LH-RH, and the mean plasma testosterone responses to human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation did not differ between the prepubertal, early pubertal, and late pubertal groups compared with normal boys of similar pubertal maturation. Three of 32 prepubertal ALL boys, and 5 of 12 pubertal ALL boys showed abnormalities of gonadotrophin secretion. The increased frequency of abnormalities of FSH secretion in the pubertal ALL boys compared with the prepubertal ALL boys could not be explained by more severe tubular damage in the former group. We conclude that moderately severe damage to the tubular system of the testis unassociated with Leydig cell impairment may not be detected in the prepubertal boy with current tests of testicular function.","['Shalet, S M', 'Hann, I M', 'Lendon, M', 'Morris Jones, P H', 'Beardwell, C G']","['Shalet SM', 'Hann IM', 'Lendon M', 'Morris Jones PH', 'Beardwell CG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Puberty', 'Testis/*physiopathology', 'Testosterone/blood']",PMC1627226,1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.56.4.275 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1981 Apr;56(4):275-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.56.4.275.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,

MTX dianilide was likewise prepared, in comparable yield, from APA and L-glutamic acid dianilide via the mixed carboxylic--carbonic anhydride method. Dihydrazide and bis(N-methylhydrazide) derivatives of MTX were formed readily from MTX diethyl ester. However, reaction with hydroxylamine led to MTX gamma-monohydroxamic acid as the sole isolated product. The bis adduct appears to form, but is unstable during workup. The identity of the product was confirmed by independent mixed anhydride synthesis from APA and the gamma-monohydroxamate of L-glutamic acid. Treatment of MTX dimethyl ester with N,N-dimethylhydrazine unexpectedly yielded MTX gamma-monomethyl ester. MTX dianilide was active against L1210 leukemia in mice, with a +155% increase in life span at a dose of 160 mg/kg given ip in 10% Tween 80 on a q3d X 3 schedule. The bis(p-chlorobenzylamide), bis(p-methoxybenzylamide), and dihydrazide were also active against L1210 leukemia in vivo, but to a lesser extent than the dianilide. The gamma-monohydroxamic acid derivative showed activity (+111% ILS at 40 mg/kg) similar to that of MTX and was found to bind to a partially purified dihydrofolate reductase preparation from L1210 cells with an ID50 of 0.005 microM as compared to 0.007 microM for MTX. In vivo experiments in mice indicated that the pharmacokinetic properties of this compound and of MTX are similar but failed to demonstrate any advantage over MTX in terms of selective uptake into tumor (sc implanted P388 leukemia) or improved penetration of the central nervous system. The activities of the dianilide, bis(benzylamide), and dihydrazide derivatives in vivo are of interest in view of their low toxicity relative to MTX against cells in culture, which suggests that these derivatives are probably acting as prodrugs in the intact animal.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Yu, C S', 'Uren, J', 'Lazarus, H', 'Wick, M']","['Rosowsky A', 'Yu CS', 'Uren J', 'Lazarus H', 'Wick M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Amides/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Glutamates', 'Hydrazines/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Mice']",,1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00137a016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1981 May;24(5):559-67. doi: 10.1021/jm00137a016.,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CH-23/CH/OID CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Sequential precipitation experiments using antibody 5E9, alpha OD heteroantiserum (raised against T ALL cells), and monoclonal antibody OKT9 demonstrated that the 3 antibody preparations recognized the same 90,000 m.w. glycoprotein. Thus, antibody 5E9 defines an 90,000 m.w. human cell surface antigen that is absent on the majority of PB mononuclear cells and is expressed on rapidly dividing normal and malignant human cells.

A comparison of the effect of FT and 5-FU on the proliferation of L 1210 ascites tumor cells in the present work has shown that both drugs result in an inhibition of DNA synthesis due to an inhibition of thymidylate synthetase. However, the extent of the effect of FT is reduced, i.e., to achieve a cell kinetic effect comparable to that of 5-FU, 60 times the equimolecular FT dose has to be applied. Thus, there is no dose-saving effect of FT compared to 5-FU. A depot-like 5-FU effect of FT due to a slow release of 5-FU from FT as described in the literature could not be confirmed in the present study either. The effect of FT on the proliferation of L 1210 ascites tumor cells did not last longer than that of 5-FU. In contrast to 5-FU a severe side effect, viz., a drastic decrease of the body temperature from 39.1 degrees to 31.6 degrees C, was observed. That means that FT cannot only be effective by a release of 5-FU. This toxic side effect must be due to a different mechanism of action of FT. A significant increase in the median life span could only be achieved by the application of 5-FU (180 microgram/g). An equimolecular FT-dose did not result in an increase of the median life span. Based on the present study, the advantages of FT compared to 5-FU described in the literature cannot be confirmed. The present work shows that cell kinetic studies in animals are a useful tool to test the effect of new drugs in chemotherapy.","['Schultze, B', 'Jellinghaus, W', 'Weis, G', 'Muller, V', 'Maurer, W']","['Schultze B', 'Jellinghaus W', 'Weis G', 'Muller V', 'Maurer W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tegafur/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Uridine/metabolism']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00405899 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1981;100(1):25-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00405899.,"['1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,

However, in spite of the large number and diversity of these chemicals, only a few have been implicated as human leukemogens. One such agent is benzene, a known bone marrow depressant. A number of case reports have associated chronic exposure to this agent with the development of acute leukemia, as have several epidemiologic surveys. Treatment with various antitumor agents, including procarbazine, melphalan, thio-TEPA, chlorambucil, and cyclophosphamide, has also been associated with the development of acute leukemia. In addition, chloramphenicol and phenylbutazone have been implicated as human leukemogens, but the association between exposure to these two agents and acute leukemia appears at present to be weaker than it is for benzene and antitumor agent exposure. Despite such associations between exposure to chemicals and acute leukemia, several important problems exist with regard to implicating specific agents in the development of this neoplasm in man, including the paucity of animal models for chemically induced leukemia, and the frequent necessity to rely on single case reports or clusters of cases in which chemical exposures are associated with acute leukemia.

The present study was designed to investigate whether plasma and mucosal DAO could be used to monitor the timing and severity of injury and recovery of the intestinal mucosa after administration of the chemotherapeutic agent 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). A dose of 0.3 g/kg s.c. every 8 hr for 6 doses was given to adult Lewis x Brown Norway rats. This resulted in death of the proliferating crypt cells, followed by regeneration of the mucosa from the surviving crypt cells, with recovery by Day 8. This mucosal damage and recovery was reflected by histological changes and a decrease in activity of mucosal disaccharidases and alkaline phosphatase. Both mucosal and plasma DAO levels also fell markedly to less than 10% of basal levels (N = 30, p less than 0.005) by Day 4 and recovered with a time course similar to the histological and biochemical changes indicative of injury and recovery. With increasing dosage and/or increasing duration of ara-C treatment, mucosal injury was progressive, with increasing loss of both plasma and mucosal DAO levels as compared to controls (N = 38, p less than 0.005). Plasma DAO levels in three patients with leukemia following ara-C chemotherapy decreased markedly to less than 30% of basal pretreatment levels (p less than 0.05) by Days 9 to 12, with a time course that was compatible with clinical intestinal mucosal injury. Our data document that plasma DAO levels reflect the mucosal injury and subsequent recovery after ara-C treatment in the rat and humans. Thus, plasma DAO may serve as a marker of the integrity of the intestinal mucosa after chemotherapy.","['Luk, G D', 'Vaughan, W P', 'Burke, P J', 'Baylin, S B']","['Luk GD', 'Vaughan WP', 'Burke PJ', 'Baylin SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)/analysis/*blood', 'Animals', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Disaccharidases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Intestinal Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Intestinal Mucosa/analysis/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Rats', 'Regeneration', 'Time Factors', 'alpha-Glucosidases/metabolism']",,1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Jun;41(6):2334-7.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Disaccharidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-Glucosidases)']","['1 P50 HL19157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01 AM27447/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', '5 R01 CA18404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

The degree of blastic infiltration does not affect the haematological presentation and the frequency of acute leukaemia evolution.

The immunofluorescence assay, particularly when used in combination with antisera to surface membrane antigens, has proved a sensitive technique for detecting small numbers of lymphoblasts in extramedullary sites, for example, testis or cerebrospinal fluid, or of residual Thy-ALL blasts in the marrow, which might otherwise be difficult to recognise. Differences in concentration of several enzymes concerned in purine metabolism have been detected between the blast cells in the various acute leukaemias. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) concentrations tend to be higher in Thy-ALL than in other forms of leukaemia, but the wide overlap reduces the diagnostic value of this assay. Thy-ALL blasts, however, appear to be selectively and exquisitely susceptible to inhibition of ADA by the drug deoxycoformycin, which has now been used sucessfully in a number of other wise resistant patients with Thy-ALL to obtain a complete remission. The recently introduced technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies has substantially widened the reagents available for analysing the membrane characteristics of bone marrow stem cells and of cell lineages derived from them. These have revealed previously unsuspected heterogeneity among different cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, for example, among Thy-ALL blasts from different patients, and they have also delineated minor populations of immature thymocytes from which these leukaemic cells are derived. The potential use of these antibodies to prevent graft-versus-host disease by selective removal of T-lymphocytes from donor bone marrow before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or to prevent recurrence of Thy-ALL and other lymphoblastic leukaemias or lymphomas by selective removal of leukaemic or lymphoma malignant cells before autologous transplantation, is reviewed.","['Hoffbrand, A V', 'Janossy, G']","['Hoffbrand AV', 'Janossy G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism']",PMC1146474,1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.34.3.254 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1981 Mar;34(3):254-62. doi: 10.1136/jcp.34.3.254.,"['0 (Antibodies)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",,,69,,,,,,

Their preclinical spectrum includes activity against murine leukemias and against the murine ependymoblastoma, which is particularly noteworthy for DAG. Dibromomannitol trials were targeted to chronic myelogenous leukemia but no advantage over busulfan therapy was demonstrable. Dibromodulcitol and DAG were sequentially evaluated for their usefulness against a wide variety of tumors. The activity of DBD against breast cancer has stimulated several continuing trials in this disease. On the other hand, DAG was disappointing in breast cancer and in several other malignancies, but some activity has been noted against lung cancer. Both DBD and DAG are being investigated for possible usefulness in the management of patients with intracranial neoplasms.

It has been recognized that hyperviscosity can be present if any one of the blood viscosity factors is increased, even if the viscosity of whole blood appears normal or even subnormal. While hyperviscosity may result in ischemic and thromboembolic episodes, the causes of hyperviscosity may include cancer, genetic abnormality, infection, metabolic disorders, and many others. The basic causes can be, in their turn, affected and reinforced by hyperviscosity. Superimposition of an added hyperviscosity factor onto already elevated blood viscosity might lead to precipitation of ischemic episodes. This review deals with the correlations between hyperviscosity and heat disease and among diabetes, cancer, and chronic anxiety.

Furthermore, we found that the quality of rosettes formed by the nonpathogenic bacteria with the lymphocytes, i.e., the number of bacteria per lymphocytes, was lower than that of pathogenic Brucella species. We conclude that all of the Brucella species tested have the ability to bind to human B lymphocytes, but that only those which are human pathogens bind firmly to all B lymphocytes and may be used as reliable markers for these cells. We also suggest that the binding of Brucella species to B lymphocytes may have some bearing on the pathogenesis of brucellosis in humans.","['Bratescu, A', 'Mayer, E P', 'Teodorescu, M']","['Bratescu A', 'Mayer EP', 'Teodorescu M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Brucella/*immunology', 'Brucella abortus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/microbiology', 'Rosette Formation']",PMC351382,1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.31.2.816-821.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1981 Feb;31(2):816-21. doi: 10.1128/iai.31.2.816-821.1981.,,"['1 RO1 AI14630/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1 RO1 CA 21399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 RO1 AM 19414/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The three H-2 linked Rmv genes are immune response genes controlling the antiviral antibody response.,914-8,"It has been shown previously that three different H-2-associated genes control the resistance to viremia and leukemia in Moloney virus-infected mice: Rmv. 1, mapping to the I-A or less probably K regions; Rmv. 2, mapping to the I-C, S or G regions and Rmv. 3, mapping to the D or T regions. Experiments have been performed to determine the role of these genes in the control of the antibody responses directed against Moloney murine leukemia virus (M. MuLV) virions and/or leukemic cells. The inoculation of infectious M.MuLV failed to provide conclusive responses due to unequal replication of the virus in different inbred strains resulting in variable antigenic stimulations and/or in vivo antibody absorptions. The use of inactivated M.MuLV as antigen allowed to avoid these problems. It showed that (2) the IgG-specific antiM.MuLV response is controlled by H-2 linked genes, (b) a clear correlation exists between high or low-responder phenotypes and the resistance or susceptibility to M.MuLV infection and (c) all three Rmv genes behave like immune response genes. These results were not surprising for Rmv. 1 and Rmv. 2 which map in the I region of the major histocompatibility complex. It was more puzzling for Rmv. 3. Further experiments are necessary to determine the exact mechanism by which this gene controls the immune response.","['Debre, P', 'Boyer, B', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Bismuth, A', 'Levy, J P']","['Debre P', 'Boyer B', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Bismuth A', 'Levy JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",,1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830101205 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1980 Dec;10(12):914-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830101205.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,

Using two 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-negative leukemias, we have for the first time been able to measure the synthesis and biological effects of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) in intact mammalian tumor cells. Malignant cells lacking this enzyme, unlike enzyme-positive cells, excreted MTA into the culture medium at a rate of 0.58 to 0.70 nmol/hr/mg protein. The production of the nucleoside was inhibited effectively by nontoxic concentrations of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), a putrescine-depending S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase inhibitor, and also by spermidine and spermine but was enhanced by putrescine. In a reciprocal fashion, MTA at low concentrations progressively increased both the synthesis and concentration of putrescine but suppressed spermine production. The unique alterations in polyamine metabolism induced by elevated MTA levels could offer a selective growth advantage to the 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient cells and thus may be related to the high frequency of this enzyme deficiency among human leukemic cell lines.","['Kamatani, N', 'Carson, D A']","['Kamatani N', 'Carson DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Thionucleosides/deficiency/*metabolism']",,1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Nov;40(11):4178-82.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']","['AM 25443/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Tumor cells were identified as an excess of cells bearing one light chain type ('clonal excess') at discrete levels of fluorescence intensity. Normal patterns of fluorescence staining are compared to those for tissues infiltrated with tumor. For B cell neoplasms with surface Ig of weak intensity, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as few as 1% of the tumor cells admixed with normal cells could be detected; the bright surface fluorescence of cells from lymphoma permitted their recognition when only 0.1% of the tumor cells were present. FACS analysis was carried out on the peripheral blood of a series of patients with B cell lymphoma whose blood was normal by classic cytologic and cytochemical analysis.

In patients with many neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood, the presence of neutropenia and monocytopenia as well as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in the neoplastic cells, appears to be crucial for early diagnosis. Thus, the clinical features and routine laboratory data alone are sufficient in the majority of cases to suggest the diagnosis HCL. The monocytopenia proved to be most helpful in this respect.

Continuous-flow red cell exchange effectively reduced the haemoglobin S concentration in an individual with sickle cell disease prior to general anaesthesia and abdominal surgery. Complications were not encountered although the procedures were carried out repetitively over prolonged periods of time. All 5 patients tolerated their exchanges without discomfort. As with any new and expensive technique, caution should attend the introduction of continuous-flow plasma or red cell exchange into clinical medicine.

Identification of an interleukin 2-producing human leukemia T cell line.,1709-19,"To isolate a stable tumor cell line capable of producing human interleukin 2 (IL-2; formerly referred to as T cell growth factor), 16 human T and B leukemia cell lines were screened for constitutive and mitogen-stimulated IL-2 production. We found that the T cell leukemia line designated Jurkat-FHCRC produced > 200 U/ml of IL-2 activity after a 24-h stimulation with T cell mitogens. Peak mitogen-induced IL-2 activity was found in supernates harvested from 24-h Jurkat-FHCRC cell cultures stimulated with either 1% phytohemagglutinin or 20 microgram/ml concanavalin A. Addition of the fatty acid derivative phorbol myristate acetate to mitogen-stimulated cultures increased Jurkat-FHCRC IL-2 production to concentrations > 400 U/ml.

When large numbers (10(6) to 10(7)) of BCL1 cells were injected into these mice, leukemia, as measured by the appearance of leukemic cells in peripheral blood with subsequent mortality, did not occur in C.B-20, was delayed in C.AL-20, and progressed at the same rate in BAB-14 relative to BALB/c control mice. These results indicate that an immune response directed against an antigen encoded for by an H chain V region gene (idiotype or variable-region allotype) or linked gene (minor histocompatibility antigen) prevents the growth of the BCL1 leukemia in the C.B-20 mice. Tumor resistance appears to be due to T cell activity since adoptive transfer of such cells from C.B-20 tumor rejectors protected sublethally irradiation recipients from subsequent tumor challenge. Although H-2 restricted, anti-BCL1 cytotoxic cells were detected in C.B-20 mice challenged in vivo and restimulated in vitro with BCL1 cells, evidence is discussed that suggests that the resistance observed is not due to these effector cells. The resistance of allotype congenic mice to BCL1 was not absolute; a small inoculum (10(2)) was as lethal in C.B-20 and C.AL-20 as BALB/c mice. Thus, Ig-encoded cell surface antigens, although immunogenic, in no way ensure ultimate host survival.","['Ciavarra, R', 'Forman, J']","['Ciavarra R', 'Forman J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Code', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin Allotypes', '*Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', '*Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Jan;126(1):54-8.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Allotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",['CA-23115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Despite morphological resemblance between megaloblastosis in erythroleukaemia and nutritional megaloblastosis, the dU suppression values in erythroleukaemia were within normal range in contrast to abnormal dU suppression in vitamin B12/folate-deficient megaloblastic bone marrows. The incorporation of 3H-thymidine alone was significantly lower in erythroleukaemia than in normal or vitamin B12/folate-deficient megaloblastic bone marrows. Autoradiographic studies showed that 3H-TdR labelling indices as well as mean grain count (MGC) of basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts were significantly lower in erythroleukaemia than in normal or vitamin B12/folate-deficient bone marrows. The reduced incorporation of 3H-TdR in erythroleukaemia erythroblasts was probably not due to deficiency of the salvage pathway enzyme, thymidine kinase, since MTX (10(-5) M) which blocks the de novo pathway of thymine-DNA synthesis, enhanced the incorporation of 3H-TdR into erythroblasts in erythroleukaemia as well as in normal bone marrows. A high intracellular pool of thymidine-triphosphate (dTTP) due to defective DNA synthesis may allosterically inhibit thymidine kinase and 3H-TdR incorporation.","['Das, K C', 'Garewal, G', 'Mohanty, D']","['Das KC', 'Garewal G', 'Mohanty D']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Deoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/metabolism']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000207224 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1980;64(3):121-30. doi: 10.1159/000207224.,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,

The differentiated Ml cells synthesized and released prosetaglandins, whereas untreated Ml cells did not. When the cells wee prelabelled with [14C]arachidonate, the major prostaglandins released into the culture media were found to be prostaglandin E2, D2, and F2 alpha in an early stage of differentiation, but the mature cells produced predominantly prostaglandin E2. The synthesis and release of prostaglandins were completely inhibited by indomethacin. Dexamethasone, a potent inducer of differentiation of Ml cells, did not induce production of prostaglandins in resistant Ml cells that could not differentiate even with a high concentration of dexamethasone. These results suggest that production of prostaglandins in Ml cells is closely associated with differentiation of the cells. Homogenates of dexamethasone-treated Ml cells converted arachidonate to prostaglandins, but this conversion was scarcely observed with homogenates of untreated Ml cells. Dexamethasone and the other inducers stimulated the release of arachidonate from phospholipids. Therefore, induction of prostaglandin synthesis during differentiation of Ml cells may result from induction of prostaglandin synthetase activity and stimulation of the release of arachidonate from cellular lipids. Lysozyme activity, which is a typical biochemical marker of macrophages, was induced in Ml cells by prostaglandin E2 or D2 alone, as well as by inducers of differentiation of the cells, but it was not induced by arachidonate or prostaglandin F2 alpha. These results suggest that prostaglandin synthesis is important in differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells.","['Honma, Y', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Hozumi, M', 'Koshihara, Y']","['Honma Y', 'Kasukabe T', 'Hozumi M', 'Koshihara Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/*biosynthesis']",,1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041040308 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1980 Sep;104(3):349-57. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041040308.,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",,,,,,,,,

Another lambda 1-producing myeloma tumor line (HOPC-2020) and a lambda 1-containing B cell leukemia line (BCL1) also contain significant levels of kappa RNA. One lambda 11-producing line (MOPC-315) contains no detectable kappa RNA, but it also has no kappa genes in the embryonic configuration. kappa-related proteins are not detectable in the lambda 1-producing lines by standard procedures, but by sensitive methods at least two lines contain kappa protein fragments. The MOPC-104E line produces both a 14.5K kappa fragment that is not readily detectable because of its low rate of synthesis and short half-life (T 1/2 less than 5 min), and a major 16.5K protein that lacks kappa cross reactivity but is demonstrable by translation of purified MOPC-104E kappa RNA. The HOPC-1 kappa RNA also encodes a short-lived 14K kappa fragment. The MPC-11 line, which produces a mature kappa RNA and protein as well as an 800 base kappa fragment RNA and kappa protein fragment, has both kappa alleles rearranged, one apparently aberrantly between J and C kappa. Two different kappa RNA species, one the same size as the MPC-11 kappa fragment RNA, frequently are present in kappa RNA-containing Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed lymphoid cells as well as in 18 and 19 day murine fetal liver. For light chains, neither allelic nor isotype exclusion is generally evident in myeloma and lymphoma cells; rather both produce only a single functional light chain.

Such activation requires the binding of C1 to the viral surface through two subcomponents, C1q and C1s. This conclusion is based on the following results. (1) Isolated human C1q and C1s bind the same membrane protein on virions. (2) Binding one subcomponent is independent of the other. (3) Only dimeric C1s binds, whereas monomeric C1s, prepared by dissociation with ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), has no affinity for the virus. (4) The activated C1s dimer, C1s, does not attach to the virus. (5) Saturation of C1s binding sites on the viral surface does not prevent binding of macromolecular C1, but such bound C1 is not activated. (6) No exchange occurs between C1s bound to the viral membrane and C1s contained in C1, which in turn is attached via C1q to the same virus. Therefore activation occurs only when both C1q and C1s in the same C1 complex in contact with the viral activator. Human C1r has no affinity for the virus nor does guinea pig C1s. The latter result explains why guinea pig serum does not function in antibody-independent virolysis.","['Bartholomew, R M', 'Esser, A F']","['Bartholomew RM', 'Esser AF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Complement C1/*metabolism', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Protein Binding', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology', 'Virion/physiology']",,1980/06/24 00:00,1980/06/24 00:01,['1980/06/24 00:00'],"['1980/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00554a005 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1980 Jun 24;19(13):2847-53. doi: 10.1021/bi00554a005.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Complement C1)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,

After pokeweed mitogen stimulation, intracellular synthesis of J chain and immunoglobulins appeared simultaneoulsy and was most pronounced during early days of culture. These data indicate that J chain is not expressed during the earliest stages (pre-B and B cells) of differentiation of lymphoid cells and that the synthesis of J chain is closely linked to the production of immunoglobulin chains, irrespective of the class. Examination of lymphoid cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of patients with various lymphoproliferative diseases (secretory and non-secretory multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, H- or L-chain diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, plasma cell leukaemia, and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma) revealed that J chain was present in various proportions of the cells that contained monomeric (IgG, IgD or IgA) or polymeric (IgA or IgM) immunoglobulins, as well as in cells from patients with H- or L-chain diseases.

On the other hand, both catechols had little effect on the growth of two fibroblasts derived originally from normal tissues (mouse fibroblast L929 and Chinese hamster fibroblast Don-6). Cys-dopa and L-dopa inhibited DNA and protein synthesis in YT-nu cells, but RNA synthesis was less affected.

Furthermore replacement of serum by bovine serum albumin in the growth medium of virus producing cells did not affect the AP activity.

It is shown that genes in the B, J, or E subregions of the H-2 complex confer resistance to a spontaneously arisen, tissue culture-adapted AKR thymoma, BW5147. A direct correlation is demonstrated between survival to injected BW5147 cells and humoral responsiveness in various hybrids obtained from crosses of AKR mice and C57BL/10 or C3H/DiSn derived congeneic strains differing at H-2. Cellular immunity appears to play no role in resistance to the proliferation of tumor cells. It is further established that development of effective humoral immunity depends on B cells and Ly-1+, 2-, 3- helper T-cells bearing the I-Jk phenotype. These findings seem directly applicable to the spontaneous disease, and results of studies using transformed cells from an overtly leukemic AKR mouse parallel those obtained using BW1547 cells.","['Meruelo, D', 'Flieger, N', 'Smith, D', 'McDevitt, H O']","['Meruelo D', 'Flieger N', 'Smith D', 'McDevitt HO']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', '*Isoantibodies/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC348675,1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.4.2178 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Apr;77(4):2178-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.4.2178.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,,,,,,,,

In addition, lymphocytes were prepared from three normal subjects, and five established lymphoid lines were used. Cells were extracted either with Triton 0, 2%, or with water followed by 0.2% Triton. alpha-Glucosidase activity was measured in water homogenates, water extracts after centrifugation, and Triton extracts, with or without antisera directed against acid maltase (EC 3.2.1.3) and renal maltase (EC 3.2.1.20). The percentage of acid and renal maltases was then calculated in each soluble fraction. Normal whole leukocytes (mostly granulocytes) contain both acid and ""renal"" maltases, whereas normal lymphocytes contain very little or no ""renal maltase."" This isozyme is present in chronic myelocytic leukemia, but is absent in acute myeloid and chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as in established lymphoid lines. Acid maltase is almost completely extracted with water, whereas renal maltase is extracted only with Triton. From the results, it appears that for the diagnosis of alpha glucosidase deficiency, cells should be extracted in water and centrifuged before determination. Lymphocytes, which are devoid of renal maltase, are a better diagnostic material than are granulocytes.","['Dreyfus, J C', 'Poenaru, L']","['Dreyfus JC', 'Poenaru L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase/*deficiency', 'Glucosidases/*deficiency', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'alpha-Glucosidases/metabolism']",,1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-198004000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1980 Apr;14(4 Pt 1):342-4. doi: 10.1203/00006450-198004000-00017.,"['EC 3.2.1.- (Glucosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-Glucosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.3 (Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase)']",,,,,,,,,

The clinical symptoms associated with the onset of leukemia were an increased number of leukocytes which were predominantly mature granulocytes, development of anemia, and multifocal bone lesions. Terminally, the animals had elevated immature granulocytes in the blood, cellular bone marrow with a predominant number of immature granulocytes, and hepatosplenomegaly.

In three of these subjects, serial studies showed progressive increases in basal FSH and exaggerated FSH responses to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). Although gonadal biopsies were not done, this elevation of FSH is indicative of progressive and severe damage to the germinal epithelium by chemotherapy. Elevated leutinizing hormone (LH) was found in seven and decreased testosterone (T) in two of these subjects. Increased LH responses to LHRH stimulation were also found in the three subjects studied. These findings suggest that the testicular damage is not restricted to the germinal tissue.

Subjects with no initial organ involvement were usually female (76%) and of old age (mean 69.2 years). Adenopathy or combined lymph node and spleen enlargement were inversely proportional to the mean age at diagnosis. Subsequent organ enlargement was noted in 11.7% of patients with no initial organomegaly, splenomegaly in 15% of patients with adenopathy only and adenopathy in 15% of patients with splenomegaly only. Except in the few cases with leukopenia, particularly high leuklocyte levels were noted in patients with splenomegaly (with or without adenopathy). Anemia at diagnosis was not related to the degree of organ enlargement. It is suggested that qualitative and also quantitative differences in organomegaly in CLL merit further study to establish their underlying mechanisms. CLL must be seen as something more complex than the simple mechanical expression of progressive lymphocyte accumulation.","['Paolino, W', 'Infelise, V', 'Rossi, M', 'Paolino, F', 'Locatelli, F', 'Caramellino, L', 'Levis, A']","['Paolino W', 'Infelise V', 'Rossi M', 'Paolino F', 'Locatelli F', 'Caramellino L', 'Levis A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adenoma/*etiology', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Splenomegaly/*etiology']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000207363 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1980;63(1):19-27. doi: 10.1159/000207363.,,,,,,,,,,

Cost estimates were based on blood-bank charges throughout the country. Calculations of effectiveness suggest that leukocyte transfusion might prevent 50 to 75% of early deaths from infection. Therapeutic transfusion would add approximately 10.9% to the hospital bill of the average bill of the average leukemic patient and cost $17.7 million annually nationwide. Prophylactic transfusion would add 35.2% to the hospital bill and cost $57.8 million annually. Mean cost-effectiveness ratios were $14,982 per life-year for therapeutic transfusion and $35,020 to $50,029 per life-year for prophylactic transfusion.

The study of anti-RLmale 1 responses of [(C57BL/6 x BALB/c) x BALB/c] mice shows that the major histocompatibility complex controls the anti-RLmale 1 CTL reaction at a second level, through an Ir gene, with dominant responsiveness, probably mapping to the right of I-B and controlling the high or low-CTL responder phenotype. Another non-H-2 associated gene interferes with the H-2 linked Ir gene, a responder allele at the non-H-2 locus, being necessary for the expression of the high-responder phenotype at the Ir gene locus.","['Duprez, V', 'Belucchi, S', 'Levy, J P']","['Duprez V', 'Belucchi S', 'Levy JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Genetic Linkage', '*H-2 Antigens', 'Hybridization, Genetic', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830100106 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1980 Jan;10(1):26-30. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830100106.,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,

In the present study, striking differences were demonstrated in the target cells for in vivo transformation by two clonal replication-competent type C viruses, Moloney- and Rauscher-MuLV. Moloney-MuLV-induced tumors and lymphoma cell lines exhibited Thy.1 antigen in the absence of detectable Fc or C3 receptors, indicating their T cell origin. Rauscher-MuLV primary tumors and lymphoma cell lines of the same mouse strain, however, invariably exhibited Fc receptors in the absence of Thy.1 antigen, suggesting that these tumors were of the B lymphoid lineage. The pattern of immunoglobulin synthesis by individual Rauscher-MuLV tumor cell lines was determined by both biosynthetic and radioimmunologic techniques. Rauscher-MuLV lymphoma lines invariably expressed immunoglobulin heavy (mu) chain in the absence of detectable light (kappa or lambda) chains. These findings establish that the target of neoplastic transformation in response to Rauscher-MuLV is an immature cell within the B lymphoid lineage. The demonstration of different target cells for transformation by well characterized clonal strains of mouse leukemia virus should aid in elucidating the mechanisms by which these viruses induce malignancy.","['Reddy, E P', 'Dunn, C Y', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Reddy EP', 'Dunn CY', 'Aaronson SA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Rauscher Virus/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology']",,1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(80)80043-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(80)80043-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1980 Mar;19(3):663-9. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(80)80043-2.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",,,,,,,,,

Purification and properties of this enzyme isolated from blast cells of acute myelocytic leukemia patients.,2293-300,"The enzyme uracil DNA-glycosylase has been purified from blast cells of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia. A 1000-fold purification has been achieved and the enzyme appears highly enriched for the uracil glycosylase activity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme is 30,000. Uracil DNA-glycosylase exhibits activity in the absence of any added metal and the addition of MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, NaCl, or KCl causes inhibition. EDTA as well as EGTA can inhibit enzyme activity. An interesting finding is the biphasic effect of spermine. At a concentration of 25 microM, spermine will cause a 2.5-fold activation of enzyme activity, whereas at concentrations of 100 microM and higher, spermine will inhibit enzyme activity. An Arrhenius plot of glycosylase activity in the presence of 25 microM spermine shows a biphasic curve with the transition temperature being 36 degrees C. Initial velocity studies in the presence of varying concentrations of spermine indicate a change in both the apparent Km and Vmax of the enzyme. Various uracil analogs were tested to establish a structure-activity relationship for this enzyme. It appears from this data that uracil DNA-glycosylase is very specific for uracil moieties. Uracil, acting as a product inhibitor, gives a Ki value of 220 microM.","['Caradonna, S J', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Caradonna SJ', 'Cheng YC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Blastomeres/*enzymology', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cations, Monovalent', '*DNA Glycosylases', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Polyamines/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Uracil/analogs & derivatives', 'Uracil-DNA Glycosidase']",,1980/03/25 00:00,1980/03/25 00:01,['1980/03/25 00:00'],"['1980/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85889-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1980 Mar 25;255(6):2293-300.,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Cations, Monovalent)', '0 (Polyamines)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (Uracil-DNA Glycosidase)']",,,,,,,,,

Two human T-cell derived cell lines of acute lymphatic leukemia origin showed moderate but significant adsorption, and the same was true for unfractionated marmoset lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood did not adsorb, before or after fractionation, whereas normal human thymocytes showed moderate but significant adsorption.

In patients with leukemia, this was most likely due to large numbers of circulating blast cells diluting or replacing the effector cells. In patients with aplastic anemia there was an apparent absence of the effector cells in a proportion of the patients. After marrow transplantation, cytotoxic activity in all three systems returned to normal rapidly, by 30 days, and remained so through 100 days.

Furthermore, they point out the need for new in vitro approaches for meaningful monitoring of marrow transplant patients.

The same is true in plant cells, where no DNA polymerase beta activity is detectable and the pattern of the high mol. wt. cluster is similar to that observed in E. coli extracts (which also lack low mol. wt. peptides). Also in mitochondria from higher and lower eukaryotes only high mol. wt. species are observed, and the active band(s) range from 70000 to 145000 daltons. Our results indicate that the structure of DNA polymerase has been highly conserved during evolution so that an active fragment of mol. wt. greater than or equal to 70 000 is always found in prokaryotic enzymes and in the replicative species of eukaryotic and mitochondrial DNA polymerases; at a certain stage in evolution, another species of low mol. wt.

Specifically, N-ethyl-, N-n-propyl-, N-n-butyl-, and N-n-butyl-N',N'-dimethyl-N-nitrosoureas have been found to be effective for inducing leukemias in rats. The induced leukemias are divided into four major types; myeloblastic, myelocytic, erythroblastic, and lymphoblastic, and each type is hematologically and pathologically characteristic. Four possible pathways for the induction process of leukemia by N-nitrosoureas are proposed and discussed. 1) Normal hematopoietic cell(s) mutate directly into leukemic cell(s) by the direct action of N-nitrosourea. 2) Hematopoietic cell(s) recover from chemically or physiologically induced cytotoxic effects and undergo proliferation into leukemic cell(s) by secondary N-nitrosourea action. 3) Bone marrow cell(s) are altered by chemical or physical agents and exhibit genetic instability to become leukemic cell(s) by secondary N-nitrosourea action. 4) The bone marrow cells upon interaction with chemical or physical agents become altered cells, which may undergo intensive clonal proliferation. These proliferating cells may subsequently interact with additional N-nitrosourea to develop into leukemic cell(s). In addition, the immunosuppressive state of the host, various growth factors, and promotors may also act on the newly induced leukemic cell(s) to produce and apparent leukemia. Experiments on rat thymic lymphoma are also briefly reviewed.","['Ogiu, T', 'Odashima, S']","['Ogiu T', 'Odashima S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*toxicity', 'Rats']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1982;32 Suppl 1:223-35.,['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)'],,,48,,,,,,

Before the differentiation, the M1 cells do not have a locomotive and phagocytic activity but do after the differentiation. The rather peculiar properties of actin shown by the leukemic M1 cells, low polymerizability and low affinity to myosin ATPase as well as the presence of polymerization inhibitor may explain their inability of motility and phagocytosis. Enhanced binding of actin and myosin on the plasma membrane looks necessary to carry out those differentiated functions which must need vigorous movement of the membrane. The cell movement also anticipates cell deformability which accompanies gelation in a part of cytoplasm and solation in another part. We have already isolated several gelation-factors as well as inhibitors. Not only chemical modifications of actin and myosin molecules but also quantitative variations in those regulatory proteins must be taken into consideration. Thus, studies on the cellular contractile proteins are casting a new light on the process of differentiation of the M1 cell line.","['Ichikawa, Y', 'Nagata, K', 'Sagara, J']","['Ichikawa Y', 'Nagata K', 'Sagara J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,IM,"['Actin Depolymerizing Factors', 'Actins/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Contractile Proteins/*analysis', 'Destrin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*analysis/pathology', '*Microfilament Proteins', 'Myosins/analysis/metabolism', 'Polymers/metabolism', 'Proteins/isolation & purification']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1982;32 Suppl 1:187-96.,"['0 (Actin Depolymerizing Factors)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Destrin)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",,,42,,,,,,

There is evidence that this total is likely to be very nearly complete. During the entire period (average 27.1 years) the leukaemia mortality per million person-years was 25 in the BCG vaccinated group, 20 in the vole-bacillus vaccinated group, and 21 in the randomly-allocated unvaccinated (control) group. Although there was neither a benefit nor a disadvantage from vaccination over the whole period, detailed figures suggested that there may have been a beneficial effect against leukaemia during the first 15 years after entry (that is between age 15 and 30 years) and a deleterious effect after longer intervals (or above the age of 30 years). Alternatively this swing may simply represent an unusual chance fluctuation. There has been no sign in recent years of any substantial decrease in leukaemia mortality in England and Wales at ages 15-29 years, although the proportion of children given BCG vaccine at about age 13 years has risen from less than 1 per cent (for the cohort aged 15-19 years in 1951-1955) to more than 70 per cent 25 years later. It has therefore been provisionally concluded that chance is the explanation for the apparent swing from prevention to enhancement, and that BCG vaccination at age 13-14 years in Great Britain does not affect subsequent mortality from leukaemia.","['Sutherland, I']",['Sutherland I'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'BCG Vaccine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'England', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/*prevention & control', 'Vaccination', 'Wales']",,1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.4780010410 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 1982 Oct-Dec;1(4):329-35. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780010410.,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],,,,,,,,,

It is suggested that the density and/or the accessibility of membranous antigens may be different on B and T cells, or alternatively that in addition to antigens common to all lymphocytes, anti-I and non-I/i cold agglutinins recognize specific antigenic determinants on B lymphocytes, whereas anti-i cold agglutinins recognize specific antigenic determinants on T lymphocytes.","['Pruzanski, W', 'Armstrong, M', 'Ko, H', 'Norman, C', 'Minta, J']","['Pruzanski W', 'Armstrong M', 'Ko H', 'Norman C', 'Minta J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,IM,"['Agglutinins/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cryoglobulins', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology']",,1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1982 Dec;15(4):409-18.,"['0 (Agglutinins)', '0 (Cryoglobulins)', '0 (cold agglutinins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

The use of CSA has made possible the technique of a mis-matched transplant, but as yet an unrelated donor has not been used. It may be that tolerance is more easily established with a one haplotype mis-match than with a completely unrelated person who may, nevertheless, be HLA identical. Clearly this would be an exciting project for the future, provided that all problems concerning relapse of disease and GvHD are overcome, and will also probably depend upon improvements in tissue typing techniques. (table; see text) Certainly we would now recommend this form of treatment to all patients under 40 years of age, in first remission from AML. Patients above this age, have responded less well and have been prone to more complications. We do not as yet know whether a complete remission is essential prior to embarking on a graft; certainly a few patients have been in early relapse, and this does not seem to have necessarily produced a poor outcome. Florid relapse at the present time is a definite contra-indication and no patients have been grafted in this situation. It will be noted that results for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and chronic granulocytic leukaemia are bad. The first group were grafted early in the programme, but the number of relapses was extremely high and was accompanied in many circumstances by interstitial pneumonitis. Transplantation in chronic granulocytic leukaemia, a disease in which the prognosis has not improved for the past 20 years, has also not been successful except in one syngeneic graft. Two of the three deaths were in previously treated patients, one in blast transformation, but the third was virtually untreated and GvHD was a very serious problem indeed. Other reports of grafting for CGL have been discouraging except in twins. All these deaths occurred early. Whether this therapeutic approach will remain a treatment of choice remains to be seen, but we are very encouraged by our progress so far, although much work remains to be done.","['Clink, H M']",['Clink HM'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Trans Med Soc Lond,Transactions of the Medical Society of London,7506118,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Methods', 'Tissue Donors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Trans Med Soc Lond. 1980-1981;97:16-26.,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,

Amsacrine's mechanism of action is not clearly understood, although the drug is known to inhibit DNA synthesis. As an investigational NCI ""Group C"" agent, amsacrine is available to physicians for the treatment of adult patients with refractory acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) under an established protocol. Following intravenous administration, amsacrine has a biphasic plasma clearance. It is extensively metabolized by the liver to inactive compounds that are excreted in the bile. Phase I studies indicated that amsacrine was potentially effective in patients with solid tumors and acute leukemias. Patients with solid tumors could tolerate much lower doses of amsacrine than leukemia patients because of dose-limiting bone-marrow suppression in the former. In Phase II studies, amsacrine appeared effective in treating the acute leukemias, with response rates of 31% and 23% for acute lymphocytic leukemia and ANLL, respectively. Patients with other types of cancers have not responded to amsacrine therapy. Frequently occurring adverse effects of amsacrine include leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients with solid tumors; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; mucositis in patients receiving higher doses (leukemia patients); alopecia; hepatotoxicity; and phlebitis. The clinical usefulness of amsacrine appears limited to treatment of the acute leukemias. Studies of combination therapies that include amsacrine are currently underway and should further define the therapeutic role of amsacrine.","['Grove, W R', 'Fortner, C L', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Grove WR', 'Fortner CL', 'Wiernik PH']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Clin Pharm,Clinical pharmacy,8207437,IM,"['*Aminoacridines/adverse effects/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy']",,1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Pharm. 1982 Jul-Aug;1(4):320-6.,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",['1 P50C A32107-01/PHS HHS/United States'],,61,,,,,,

This result was roughly compared with that obtained by Thomas et al. until 1977. Interstitial pneu-monia and infections were the main (80%) cause of death. Since October, 1980, following Thomas, recommendation, our BMT team performed Allo-BMT to 5 leukemic patients in complete remission, 2 of whom (40%) are for 14 and 10 months post-transplant in unmaintained remission. According to the previously described method, our BMT team performed autologous BMT (Auto-BMT) to 4 patients with acute leukemia and 11 with several cancers of undifferentiated cell type. The 4 leukemics achieved earlier complete remission, but all died of relapse, thus suggesting that Auto-BMT is only one of supportive therapies. Results of Auto-BMT performed to 5 patients with malignant lymphoma, encouraged by our experience of Allo-BMT to a patient with malignant lymphoma of CS IV, who survived with no chemotherapy 10 1/2 months posttransplant, showed that one patient is alive for 22 months posttransplant in unmaintained remission, and patients have relapsed 2, 6 and 14 1/2 months posttransplant, but are still alive for 25, 14 and 28 months posttransplant, respectively, well responding to chemotherapy. One of 2 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is healthy for 2 years posttransplant in unmaintained remission. The remaining 5 patients died of either infections or relapse. Relapse in both Allo- and Auto-BMT cases, and infectious complications, and no covering of expenses for BMT by health insurance were main problems in Japan and how to solve them were discussed.

The differences in the complete remission rate, duration of remission and median survival were not significant among these groups. 2) 5000 leukocyte differential and survival: 86 cases with acute leukemia which achieved complete remission were divided into three groups according to the levels of remaining leukemic cells by 5000 leukocyte differential: 0-1/5000-39 cases, 2-4/5000-24 cases and 5-/5000-23 cases. A close correlation between the leukemic cell level during remission and survival of patients was observed. A marked tendency of longer survival was observed in cases in which leukemic cells decreased during remission and vice versa. 3) Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) therapy: Up to now, 15 patients have been treated and 4 of them are alive now.

It allows more intensive treatment to be given without regard to marrow toxicity and allows in the case of allogeneic marrow an additional immunotherapeutic effect through graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Initially, allogeneic transplants in HLA matched sibling donors were only employed in end-stage patients. Although there were encouraging results in terms of long-term therapeutic effects, the overall mortality was prohibitive. Subsequently, patients were transplanted in remission with a marked improvement in overall survival in both acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The major obstacles to further improvement in the therapeutic effects of this procedure have been identified (i.e., GVHD, viral infection, and relapse in ALL) and are subject to intensive investigations that already show encouraging results. Syngeneic marrow transplantation is limited for obvious reasons, but early results have shown significant therapeutic effects, in particular, in chronic myelogenous leukemia. These results have encouraged others to use autologous bone marrow. Marrow contamination with unseen tumor cells is being approached by pharmacologic and immunologic techniques designed to ""purge"" marrow of tumor cells. Animal and initial clinical studies have been encouraging.","['Santos, G W']",['Santos GW'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Yale J Biol Med,The Yale journal of biology and medicine,0417414,IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Virus Diseases/etiology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC2596566,1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yale J Biol Med. 1982 Sep-Dec;55(5-6):477-85.,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']","['CA-06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Prolymphocytes have a B-cell membrane phenotype with strong expression of surface Ig in 81% of cases (B-PLL) whilst the rest have T-cell markers (T-PLL). Both forms of the disease have distinct laboratory and clinical findings. T-PLL has a more aggressive course with a median survival of 7 months (24 months in B-PLL). Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates larger lysosomal granules in T-PLL cells which results in a higher content of acid hydrolases.

In blocking experiments, AggIgD binding was shown to be specific and Fc dependent. Likewise, B but not T derived neoplastic lymphoid clones expressed Fc delta receptors. Fc delta receptors were exclusively present on neoplastic clones that also expressed SmIgD. Neoplastic lymphoid cells expressing SmIgM alone did not express Fc delta. The chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell which typically bore membrane SmIgM and SmIgD expressed multiple FcR with specificities for IgM, IgD and IgG.

Remission duration and survival were similar when induction regimens were compared. Forty-five patients reaching maintenance therapy were randomised to either chemo-immunotherapy (BCG plus intradermal leukaemic blast cells) or chemotherapy alone. The duration of CR in these two groups was almost identical, though patients receiving chemotherapy alone had prolonged survival (median 161 weeks) when compared to the chemo-immunotherapy group (84 weeks, p = 0 . 07).

Thus, the original deposition of radiation energy (that is, the dose) is unaltered by metabolic characteristics of cells and tissue, unlike the situation for chemical agents. Intensely ionizing radiations, such as neutrons and alpha particles, are up to ten times more damaging than sparsely ionizing sources such as x-rays or gamma rays for equivalent doses. Furthermore, repair in cells and tissues can ameliorate the consequences of radiation doses delivered at lower rates by up to a factor of ten compared with comparable doses acutely delivered, especially for somatic (carcinogenic) and genetic effects from x- and gamma-irradiation exposure. Studies on irradiated laboratory animals or on people following occupational, medical or accidental exposures point to an average lifetime fatal cancer risk of about 1 x 10(-4) per rem of dose (100 per 10(6) person-rem). Leukemia and lung, breast and thyroid cancer seem more likely than other types of cancer to be produced by radiation. Radiation exposures from natural sources (cosmic rays and terrestrial radioactivity) of about 0.1 rem per year yield a lifetime cancer risk about 0.1 percent of the normally occurring 20 percent risk of cancer death. An increase of about 1 percent per rem in fatal cancer risk, or 200 rem to double the ""background"" risk rate, is compared with an estimate of about 100 rem to double the genetic risk. Newer data suggest that the risks for low-level radiation are lower than risks estimated from data from high exposures and that the present 5 rem per year limit for workers is adequate.","['Goldman, M']",['Goldman M'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,West J Med,The Western journal of medicine,0410504,IM,"['Embryo, Mammalian/radiation effects', 'Fetus/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology', 'Radiation Genetics', 'Radiation Injuries/prevention & control', 'Radiation, Ionizing/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",PMC1274230,1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,West J Med. 1982 Dec;137(6):540-7.,,,,16,,,,,,

Both dThd and HU increased the cellular uptake and rate of formation of Ara-CTP. Measurement of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate pools implicated a reduction of the dCTP as the mechanism of this effect. dThd and HU had opposite effects on the incorporation of Ara-C into DNA per unit time, but both enhanced the incorporation of Ara-C per unit of newly synthesized DNA. In a Phase I trial Ara-C was given by continuous infusion for five days at 100 mg/m2, and HU by mouth every six hours with dose escalation from 0.375 to 1.78 g/m2 every six hours. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxicity; the major nonhematologic toxicity was skin rash.

To ascertain whether the immunoadjuvant effect was anatomically restricted to the peritoneal cavity (PC), spreading of IP injected lymphoma was studied by means of LSTRA cells labeled with 3-5'iodo-deoxyuridine 125I (125IUdR) and tumor bioassay in spleen, lung, kidney, liver, and PC of recipient mice. The results showed that IP tumor challenge led to early (1 h) generalized neoplasia in both untreated and CA-pretreated hosts. Therefore, the combined antitumor effects of chemotherapy and CA are not restricted to the PC but rather the result of systemic immunity. In conclusion, in our system the PC seems to be a preferential site for eliciting generalized antilymphoma host responses markedly amplified by selected schedules of immunoadjuvant administration.","['Marconi, P', 'Bistoni, F', 'Cassone, A', 'Frati, L', 'Baccarini, M', 'Garaci, E', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Marconi P', 'Bistoni F', 'Cassone A', 'Frati L', 'Baccarini M', 'Garaci E', 'Bonmassar E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Candida albicans/immunology', 'Carmustine/*therapeutic use', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Peritoneal Cavity/*immunology']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00205313 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1982;13(2):128-33. doi: 10.1007/BF00205313.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,

Each of these factors is considered in terms of the scientific data supporting their importance. Inability to measure the size of the tumor mass during all phases of treated AL continues to weaken rational strategies for therapy especially maintenance chemotherapy. Increasing the drug dose improves cell kill and potentially the cure rate up to the limits of toxicity. These limits may be extended by bone marrow transplantation. Various systems to study the drug sensitivity of leukemic cells are in experimental use, including stem cell assays but as yet they do not give a guide to altering therapy. The scheduling of multiple drugs is designed to increase cell kill by recruitment into the cycle, but ""sanctuaries"" appear to exist for resting cells. The suppression of normal hemopoiesis apparently due to leukemia-associated inhibitors is associated with favorable prognosis in childhood ALL but use of this information to improve treatment protocols is still unclear.","['Stryckmans, P', 'Delforge, A', 'Bron, D', 'Malarme, M', 'Debusscher, L', 'Suciu, S', 'Ronge-Collard, E']","['Stryckmans P', 'Delforge A', 'Bron D', 'Malarme M', 'Debusscher L', 'Suciu S', 'Ronge-Collard E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1982;8(3):603-22.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,51,,,,,,

Within the three decades of therapy evolution, evidence has accumulated that for some children with this disease cure is now a realistic goal. Two major areas of concern remain. As an increasing number of children achieve long-term disease-free survival, late consequences of the disease and its therapy have emerged as a serious consideration in the design of new treatment programs. Of these late consequences, the impaired intellectual performance found in some children, presumably related to CNS prophylaxis, is a particularly important concern. Current and future therapy protocols must address the problem of effective control of CNS leukemia with minimal consequences for normal brain function. The major deterrent to effective disease control at this time is bone marrow relapse. In some patients, drug-resistant leukemic cells, either preexistent at the time of diagnosis or acquired by modulation during drug exposure, develop a growth advantage and cause a return of the disease manifestation. Once relapse has occurred, expectations for subsequent cure are minimal. During the past decade, several clinical and biological features of acute lymphocytic leukemia have allowed for an increasingly accurate prediction of the risk for bone marrow relapse. Future studies must focus on therapeutic strategies designed to take into account the individual patient's risk of relapse. Further biological studies must focus on mechanisms of the acquisition of drug resistance and its prevention.","['Mauer, A M']",['Mauer AM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1982;8(3):553-60.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05584/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,20,,,,,,

When viewed within this context even the early results of bone marrow transplantation were encouraging. When transplantation was performed on patients with acute leukemia in first remission results clearly superior to the best currently obtainable with chemotherapy were documented. In this group of patients leukemic relapse is relatively unusual. Yet, some 40% of patients succumb, chiefly to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Current research efforts are aimed at blunting GVHD. They include the removal of T-lymphocytes from the transfused marrow by treatment with lectins and with antibodies.

Results show that in vitro glucose consumption is linked to the intensity of leukocytes concentration, and is independent of the type of leukocyte. Factitious hypoglycemia may thus frequently occur in patients with high blood leukocyte count. This phenomenon, that was previously described, is again of interest to day because many laboratories do not yet use any more glycolysis inhibitors that partially inhibit it.

DAP IV activity was measured directly in normal granulocytes, monocytes, B and T lymphocytes as well as in lymphocyte suspensions of leukemic cases. On a cytochemical level granulocytes, monocytes, B lymphocytes and all 24 cases of B-CLL were found to be DAP IV negative, though some of the latter showed positive reactions for AcE and AcP. From the six cases of T-CLL, five were positive to DAP IV cytochemically. No discrepancies were observed between cytochemical and biochemical results. It is concluded that DAP IV is a reliable and easy to perform marker for T mu lymphocytes and their neoplasias.

Studies in the BNML rat model.,763-9,"In view of its application in patients with acute leukemia prior to bone marrow transplantation, the toxicity and efficacy of high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment were evaluated in a rat model for human acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML). The LD50 in leukemic rats proved to be lower than that in normal rats (100 vs 164 mg/kg respectively). With dosages above 120 mg/kg, bone marrow transplantation was required to overcome irreversible aplasia. Additional causes of death were lung-, bladder- and intestinal tract hemorrhages (160-200 mg/kg) or acute cardiopulmonary failure (250-300 mg/kg). In leukemic rats, excessive leukemic cell kill leading to tumor cell embolism was another contributing factor. In this respect, treatment of late-stage leukemia proved invariably fatal. In leukemic rats, the highest therapeutic index was achieved with 100 mg/kg. Depending on the stage of disease, a 5-8.5 log leukemic cell kill was achieved. An increased proliferation rate of residual leukemic cells after cyclophosphamide treatment appeared likely. Finally, the present data are extrapolated to the current treatment of human acute myelocytic leukemia in complete remission with high-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with supralethal total-body irradiation.","['Hagenbeek, A', 'Martens, A C']","['Hagenbeek A', 'Martens AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",,1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(82)90075-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1982 Aug;18(8):763-9. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(82)90075-x.,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,,,,,,

The binding of the first three members of the series to covalently closed circular duplex DNA showed the unwinding properties expected of intercalators. The 2,7-diisopropyl showed intermediate properties and the 2,7-di-t-butyl derivative failed to unwind this DNA. Antibacterial toxicity, measured in cultures of Salmonella typhimurium, increased with increasing lipophilic character of the compounds. Mutagenicity in the TA1537 frameshift tester strain was restricted to the first two members of the series, although the mutagenicity of the more lipophilic members may have been masked by toxicity. In contrast, toxicity towards cultures of L1210 cells showed a possible transition between intercalating and non-intercalating derivatives. It is proposed that DNA intercalation provides the major component of the toxicity towards cultured leukaemia cells, whereas lipophilicity provides the major component towards bacteria.","['Baguley, B C', 'Ferguson, L R', 'Denny, W A']","['Baguley BC', 'Ferguson LR', 'Denny WA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Circular/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Intercalating Agents', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Proflavine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects']",,1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(82)90145-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(82)90145-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1982 Oct;42(1):97-105. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(82)90145-4.,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', 'CY3RNB3K4T (Proflavine)']",,,,,,,,,

The techniques are relatively safe and rapid, but still exceedingly expensive. The indications and efficacy of cytapheresis appear relatively clear. The role of lymphocytapheresis in various disease states is still under investigation. Plasma exchange currently must be considered a palliative procedure, but clear and prolonged benefit has resulted in a few instances. The expense will not make this a practical approach in many instances. A combination of immunosuppressive therapy with plasma exchange will evolve as a more appropriate treatment in many instances. Finally, the removal of specific substances from the plasma by immunoadsorption columns should have the advantage of less side effects, less depletion of normal elements of the plasma, and more specifically targeted therapy.","['Vogler, W R']",['Vogler WR'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/therapy', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/*trends', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Neuromuscular Diseases/therapy', 'Plasma Exchange/adverse effects/*trends', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/therapy']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1982;106:1-13.,,,,28,,,,,,

In addition, the published cases of complicating leukemia have been tabulated. Based on the results of the present study and those in the literature it appears that chromosomes #3 and #17 should be stressed as being nonrandomly involved in complicating leukemia in addition to the previously stressed chromosomes #5 and #7. The results of the present study are discussed in relation to those reported in the literature, and stress put on the significance of cytogenetic changes in relation to possible causative factors of the complicating leukemia. The hypothesis is advanced that these nonrandom chromosome changes may reflect causative specificity of the complicating leukemia and that a concerted effort must be made to obtain more cogent information on the role of noxious agents in the causation of complicating leukemia.","['Sandberg, A A', 'Abe, S', 'Kowalczyk, J R', 'Zedgenidze, A', 'Takeuchi, J', 'Kakati, S']","['Sandberg AA', 'Abe S', 'Kowalczyk JR', 'Zedgenidze A', 'Takeuchi J', 'Kakati S']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Chromosome Aberrations/complications/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary']",,1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(82)90009-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(82)90009-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1982 Oct;7(2):95-136. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(82)90009-7.,,"['CA-14555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-2599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,112,,,,,,

It was elevated to a mean value of 145.6 ng/ml (+/- 104.4 ng/ml) compared to 37.8 ng/ml (+/- 14.6 ng/ml) the sera of normal subjects. Patients with active disease generally had higher serum NCA levels than those with CML in blast crisis. A correlation of the serum NCA levels with the cellular contents of this antigen was attempted using different methods. Large variations of serum NCA levels were observed in different patients having roughly similar white blood cell (WBC) counts. In general a better correlation was observed between the serum NCA level and the number of maturing myeloid cells than with the number of polymorphs. The staining of blood smears with anti-NCA serum by an immunoperoxidase method suggested an explanation for some cases of CML in blast crisis with normal serum NCA levels inasmuch as the staining of myeloid cells was very weak or negative in these cases, indicative of a lack of NCA synthesis in the cells. In other cases, cellular NCA was measured by radioimmunoassay in maturing myeloid cells and polymorphs. The mean values were not significantly different from the NCA values obtained in normal polymorphs. From the NCA content/10(6) cells and the polymorph or maturing myeloid cell counts, we calculated the total NCA cell content/ml of blood. It was much higher than, though poorly correlated with, the serum NCA level. Thus factors other than NCA cellular content, mainly the rate of NCA release from the myeloid cells, might play an important role in the regulation of its serum level.","['Frenoy, N', 'Ben-Bunant, M', 'Berruel, C', 'Child, J A', 'Gendron, M C', 'Missett, J L', 'Razafimahaleo, E', 'Burtin, P']","['Frenoy N', 'Ben-Bunant M', 'Berruel C', 'Child JA', 'Gendron MC', 'Missett JL', 'Razafimahaleo E', 'Burtin P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radioimmunoassay']",PMC2011169,1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1982.269 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1982 Nov;46(5):765-72. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1982.269.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,

The macrophages were mostly of donor marrow origin as judged by Y body fluorescence and were morphologically normal, except for the intracellular accumulation of various amounts of heterogeneous foreign materials. Macrophage function of patients studied within four months after transplantation was impaired, as measured by chemotaxis, phagocytosis and killing of Candida pseudotropicalis, and killing of bacteria. In two patients studied six and 12 months after transplantation, macrophage functions returned toward normal except for a persistent defect in killing of C. pseudotropicalis. Cytomegalovirus was cultured from the lavaged cells of two patients, but the macrophage dysfunction was independent of the cytomegalovirus isolation. These results show that alveolar macrophage dysfunction occurs in marrow transplant recipients and may be associated with their increased risk for pulmonary infections.","['Winston, D J', 'Territo, M C', 'Ho, W G', 'Miller, M J', 'Gale, R P', 'Golde, D W']","['Winston DJ', 'Territo MC', 'Ho WG', 'Miller MJ', 'Gale RP', 'Golde DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemotaxis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Macrophages/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pneumonia/*immunology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/cytology', 'Virus Cultivation']",,1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(82)90777-X [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(82)90777-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1982 Dec;73(6):859-66. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(82)90777-x.,,"['AI-15332/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

This antibody has been previously reported to recognize a surface antigen expressed by almost all human thymocytes and peripheral T cells. It was also detected on surface immunoglobulin-bearing cells of most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia but was not detectable in normal B-cells and B-cell lines. In the present series, the neoplastic lymphocytes in 33 cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia expressed surface immunoglobulin, Ia antigen, and receptors for Fc, C3, and mouse erythrocytes. All but one case expressed the Leu-1 antigen as detected by indirect immunofluorescence using flow cytometry. In three other cases, the leukemic cells in the peripheral blood reacted with anti-Leu-1, whereas the bone marrow lymphocytes did not. Moreover, quantitative differences in the surface density of Leu-1 were apparent by flow cytometry. The peripheral blood and bone marrow lymphocytes in other B-cell leukemias, including 15 cases of leukemic B-cell lymphomas and three cases of hairy-cell leukemia, failed to stain positively with the anti-Leu-1 antibody. The recognition of the Leu-1 antigen adds to the phenotypic characterization of b-chronic lymphocytic leukemia and may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and its expression in different tissues.","['Koziner, B', 'Gebhard, D', 'Denny, T', 'Evans, R L']","['Koziner B', 'Gebhard D', 'Denny T', 'Evans RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Rosette Formation']",,1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(82)90761-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(82)90761-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1982 Dec;73(6):802-7. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(82)90761-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']","['CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27690/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

These viruses are associated with a wide variety of cancers in chickens mice, cats, and monkeys. Some retroviruses cause a specific type of cancer soon after infection in a high proportion of animals, whereas others cause various cancers late after infection in a lower proportion of animals. Highly oncogenic retroviruses are recombinants of viral and host genes. The cancers induced by these viruses are determined by the transduced host gene. Retroviruses that cause cancer at a low incidence do not contain inserted host information. Rather, they appear to cause cancer via mutation of the expression of potentially oncogenic host genes. During their normal life cycle, retroviruses integrate proviral DNA into the chromosomal DNA of their host. Integrations occur at many different sites. Most integrations are benign, but some result in cancer. Retroviral research has identified 12 potentially oncogenic host genes. Each is associated with a characteristic cancer or spectrum of cancer. Several appear to code for protein kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues.","['Robinson, H L']",['Robinson HL'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/etiology', 'Birds', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*etiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*microbiology']",,1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/4.5.1015 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1982 Sep-Oct;4(5):1015-25. doi: 10.1093/clinids/4.5.1015.,,,,80,,,,,,

The eight cell lines included two Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines, three plasmacytoma cell lines, and three spontaneous T-cell lymphomas from AKR mice. All of the cell lines in the B-cell series had high-affinity insulin binding sites. The apparent equilibrium association constant (Ka) for the high-affinity binding sites on these cells was 1.3-3.3 X 10(9) M-1. Two of the T-cell lymphomas had high-affinity receptor levels so low as to be undetectable in the whole cell binding assay under the conditions used for assaying the other cell lines, although in binding assays performed at very high cell densities, these two cell lines did appear to have a small number of high-affinity insulin binding sites. These results indicate that the growth stimulus provided by the tumor virus in neoplastic transformation of the AKR thymic lymphocytes differs from that provided by lectins in blast transformation of lymphocytes in that the neoplastic transforming event does not always result in the emergence of large numbers of high-affinity insulin receptors. In addition, the existence of cell lines such as the T-cell lymphomas that have nearly exclusively low-affinity binding sites suggests that the low-affinity sites may represent a distinct receptor that is not freely interconvertible with the high-affinity receptor.","['Straus, D S', 'Pang, K J']","['Straus DS', 'Pang KJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*analysis', 'Lymphoma/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/analysis', 'Plasmacytoma/*analysis', 'Receptor, Insulin/*analysis/metabolism']",,1982/09/17 00:00,1982/09/17 00:01,['1982/09/17 00:00'],"['1982/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00229599 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1982 Sep 17;47(3):161-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00229599.,"['0 (Insulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']","['AM21993/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05816/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes from B1- and B2-CLL patients were unable to secrete Ig either spontaneously or after PWM stimulation.

Cocultivation experiments with freshly isolated, unseparated lymphocytes from normal subjects and lymphocytes from patients were of no informational value, since isolated normal B-cells alone already showed a high rate of Ig secretion.

Six patients died of documented fungal infection, predominantly aspergillus pneumonia; the complete remission rate was only 40%. Based on this experience we began using amphotericin B empirically in any AML patient remaining febrile or having recurrent fever after a week of broad spectrum antibiotics. Of 22 patients treated from October 1978 to August 1980, none died of fungal infection during induction therapy; the remission rate increased significantly to 77%. Chemotherapy and supportive care were otherwise unchanged during this period. While the first group was older, the improvement in remission rate was also seen in patients younger than 60 years of age. Since fungal infection may be difficult to document, this study suggests that empirical amphotericin B is reasonable therapy in leukemic patients remaining febrile or having a recurrent fever following a week of broad spectrum antibiotics, if the institution has a high incidence of fungal infections.","['Stein, R S', 'Kayser, J', 'Flexner, J M']","['Stein RS', 'Kayser J', 'Flexner JM']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/*drug therapy', 'Pneumonia/complications']",,1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19821201)50:11<2247::aid-cncr2820501102>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1982 Dec 1;50(11):2247-51. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19821201)50:11<2247::aid-cncr2820501102>3.0.co;2-7.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['CA 19429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Use of this or a similar categorization should result in a more rational approach to differential diagnosis, should encourage a more focused diagnostic work-up, whould reduce the necessity for invasive procedures, should provide the microbiology laboratory information about specific organisms that should be sought sedulously, and should permit the selection of a more rational antimicrobial regimen prior to the availability of definitive microbiologic information.","['Sen, P', 'Kapila, R', 'Chmel, H', 'Armstrong, D A', 'Louria, D B']","['Sen P', 'Kapila R', 'Chmel H', 'Armstrong DA', 'Louria DB']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcoholism/complications', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/complications', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Equipment Safety', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/complications', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/complications', 'Infections/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Meningitis, Meningococcal/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology', 'Parasitic Diseases/etiology', 'Pneumonia/complications', 'Strongyloidiasis/complications', 'Virus Diseases/etiology']",,1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(82)90414-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(82)90414-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1982 Nov;73(5):706-18. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(82)90414-4.,,,,92,,,,,,

Pretransplant conditioning consisted of single-dose irradiation combined with high-dose, short-term chemotherapy in 23 patients, while four patients received a bone marrow transplantation without any radiation therapy. Thyroid dysfunction occurred in 10 of 23 (43 percent) irradiated patients; compensated hypothyroidism (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels only) developed in eight subjects, and two patients had primary thyroid failure (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and low T4 index). The abnormal thyroid studies were detected a median of 13 months after bone marrow transplantation. The four subjects who underwent transplantation without radiation therapy have remained euthyroid (median follow-up two years). The only variable that appeared to correlate with the subsequent development of impaired thyroid function was the type of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis employed; the irradiated subjects treated with methotrexate alone had a higher incidence of thyroid dysfunction compared to those treated with methotrexate combined with antithymocyte globulin and prednisone (eight of 12 versus two of 11, p less than 0.05).

In one, circulating monocyte levels remained normal over a 14-month period while examinations of blood and marrow in this case showed few hairy cells. In another case, severe and persistent monocyte deficiency was noted during a 2-year period of unsuccessful treatment. When he eventually responded to low dose chlorambucil and his Hb rose from 40-140 g/l and WBC became normal, the number of circulating monocytes also became normal.","['Janckila, A J', 'Wallace, J H', 'Yam, L T']","['Janckila AJ', 'Wallace JH', 'Yam LT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,IM,"['Esterases/metabolism', 'Histiocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', '*Monocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Skin Window Technique']",,1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1982.tb00577.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1982 Aug;29(2):153-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1982.tb00577.x.,['EC 3.1.- (Esterases)'],,,,,,,,,

Two of these, PMN 6 and PMN 29, are specific for neutrophils; the third monoclonal antibody, AML-2-23, is reactive with the majority of normal monocytes as well as a subpopulation of mature neutrophils. Although neutrophils from all individuals tested expressed these antigens, cytofluorographic analysis revealed that the percentage of cells bearing the PMN 6 and AML-2-23 antigens varied among individuals. Significant additional heterogeneity in the density of each antigen among antigen-bearing cells was also observed. All three antibodies efficiently mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity of acute myelocytic leukemia cells yet were unreactive with lymphocytic leukemia cells. Neutrophil cytotoxicity was mediated by PMN 6 and PMN 29 but not by AML-2-23. On the other hand, AML-2-23, but not PMN 6 or PMN 29, was cytotoxic for normal monocytes and macrophages.

The IgE-destroying activity, which has an extremely acid pH optimum, resisted attempts at solubilization using detergents. However, it was solubilized in good yield by use of chaotropic salts and especially KOCN. The soluble activity is stable to freezing and thawing, and to heating to 68 degrees C for 60 min. It is promptly destroyed upon boiling. IgE destruction was linear with time up to 20 min and a series of products, mol. wts 138,000, 92,500, 60,000 and 36,500, are formed during the reaction. No pH optimum for the reaction could be found because, as the pH was lowered below 4.0, the spontaneous destruction of IgE became too great. At pH 4.75 the apparent Km for the reaction was 0.55 microM and Vmax was 0.4 nmoles IgE/10(4) mast cell equivalents/min. IgE-destroying activity could be inhibited by heat-inactivated serum, and by relatively high concentrations of crude alpha 1-antitrypsin, aprotinin, lima bean and soybean trypsin inhibitors and by p-nitroguanidinobenzoate.

Efficacy and safety of the drug were evaluated. The underlying diseases in the 64 patients included in the evaluation of efficacy were acute myelocytic leukemia (30 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (9), acute promyelocytic leukemia (3), acute monocytic leukemia (2), chronic myelocytic leukemia-blastic crisis (10), erythroleukemia (2), malignant lymphoma (2), aplastic anemia (2), and others (4). The infections were septicemia in 3 patients, suspected septicemia in 47, respiratory tract infections in 7, oral infections in 3, urinary tract infections in 2, and others in 2. The clinical efficacy of CFX was 'excellent' in 13 patients, 'good' in 26, 'fair' in 6, 'poor' in 19 for an efficacy rate of 60.9%. The efficacy rate classified according to infections was 66.7% in septicemia, 66.0% in suspected septicemia, 42.9% in respiratory tract infections and 66.7% in oral infection. The organisms isolated from the patients with septicemia were E. coli in 2 patients and B. cereus in 1. B. cereus was not susceptible to CFX. The efficacy rate was 60.0% in the 10 patients whose causative organisms were identified and 61.1% in the 54 patients whose causative organisms were not identified. There was no significant difference in the efficacy rate between the patients who had failed to respond to prior antibiotic therapy and those treated with CFX from the beginning. The efficacy rates for the former group (23 patients) and for the latter group (41 patients) were 56.5% and 63.4%, respectively. The efficacy rate in patients with an initial neutrophil count less than 500/mm3 (35 cases) and from 501 to 1,000/mm3 (13 cases) were 57.1% and 76.9%, respectively. Side effects which might have been caused by CFX were skin eruptions in 2 patients (2.6%) and transient elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 patient (1.3%) among 76 patients who were evaluated for safety.

Lymphocytes from mice immunized against M-MSV (designated as immune lymphocytes, IL) inhibited tumor growth when transferred before the virus injection. However, the same lymphocytes were ineffective against tumors consisting of a solid mass when transferred after the virus inoculation. When IL was transferred shortly after 500 rad whole-body irradiation of the tumor-bearing mice, tumors regressed markedly and most of them became undetectable, while tumors of other groups receiving normal lymphocytes or medium combined with irradiation ceased to regress soon after the treatment. This effect of IL was abolished by the treatment of IL with anti-Thy 1 antibody and complement, and was not observed against antigenically distinct syngeneic tumors (Meth-A). Concomitant transfer of spleen cells from mice bearing progressing tumors with IL partially impeded the effect of IL. These results suggest that specific immune T lymphocytes induce tumor regression when transferred after the whole body irradiation of the tumor-bearing mice. The effects of irradiation may be divided into two categories: the direct effect on tumor cells, and the indirect effect upon the activity of IL.","['Kimura, H', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Fujisawa, T']","['Kimura H', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Fujisawa T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan,Gan,0151745,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Immunization, Passive', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gan. 1982 Jun;73(3):446-53.,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine how the various subcomponents of bone marrow populations contribute to the overall PCC pattern. Thirty bone marrow aspirations from persons at various stages of disease (2 normal, 11 untreated, 12 in remission, and 5 n relapse) were fractionated according to density in albumin gradients, and the various fractions were characterized by determining the proliferative potential index (PPI, or the fraction of G1 cells in late G1) using the PCC technique. In general, normal bone marrow and marrow from patients In remission showed lower PPI values throughout the gradients, with the most dense and most mature cells yielding the lowest PPI values in the gradient. In contrast, bone marrow from newly presenting patients and from patients in relapse showed higher PPI values, with the highest PPI values found In the most dense fractions containing the most mature cells. Thus, residual mature cells from patients with active disease exhibit the malignant characteristic of accumulating in late G1 phase. It is postulated that these morphologically mature cells from patients with active disease either represent matured cells of malignant origin or represent residual normal cells pushed beyond the restriction point in early G1 phase by a putative tumor growth factor synthesized by the leukemic cell population.","['Hittelman, W N', 'Vellekoop, L', 'Zander, A R', 'Dicke, K A']","['Hittelman WN', 'Vellekoop L', 'Zander AR', 'Dicke KA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Fusion', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",,1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84587-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Nov;60(5):1203-11.,,"['CA-14528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Thirteen patients remain well and in remission from 202 to 1126 d post transplantation. These results show that morbidity and mortality from the bone marrow transplantation procedure is low.

Nevertheless, it is possible to draw certain general conclusions about the effects of ALS in human subjects. ALS administration has often been shown to reduce the number of circulating E-rosette-positive lymphocytes, although the precise mechanisms by which this reduction occurs are not known. Using a combined technique of E-rosette formation and immunofluorescence, heterologous immunoglobulin has been demonstrated on T and non-T lymphocytes from patients receiving non-selective ALS. Fifteen years' experience has failed to provide convincing support for the view that ALS (including immunoglobulin prepared from the whole antiserum) prolongs human renal allograft survival. It is not yet known whether ALS is a useful immunosuppressive agent in cardiac transplantation. One observation of possible clinical interest is that bone marrow regeneration has occurred in a number of patients with aplastic anemia who have been treated with ALS. No satisfactory method has been developed for monitoring the dose of ALS in human subjects. Appropriate studies may determine whether monoclonal antilymphocytic antibodies are clinically useful, for example in prolonging the survival of transplanted organs, in preventing or treating graft-versus-host disease, or in treating lymphoma, leukemia, or aplastic anemia.","['Heyworth, M F']",['Heyworth MF'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Preservation', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thimerosal/adverse effects']",,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1982.tb00428.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1982;65:79-97. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1982.tb00428.x.,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '2225PI3MOV (Thimerosal)']",,,99,,,,,,

This pattern did not change upon differentiation. The acid protease activity of the soluble fraction increased following differentiation. After 4 days in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, the differentiated cells exhibited 4-fold higher specific activity as compared with 4 day-old control cells. In contrast, the alkaline activity of the insoluble fraction of the differentiated cells was 4-fold lower than that of the undifferentiated cells.

Twenty-two such patients received transplants, with seven surviving in remission 3-5 years later. Nineteen patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia received transplants in first remission and 11 are living in remission 3.5-5.5 years after grafting.

Administration by oral and rectal routes is indicated rather than by the intravenous route on the basis of efficacy, safety and cost; this recommendation is applicable to both loading and maintenance dosing. Intravenous administration should be restricted to emergency preoperative loading (single 500-mg dose); to patients with proven anaerobic infections; patients with serious sepsis associated with an unidentified organism; patients who are unable to take medication by mouth and those without a functional rectum or with diarrhoea; and patients with leukaemia who are vomiting. These drugs are remarkably safe under conditions of acute use if the intravenous route is avoided. However, extreme caution in their long-term use and use in obstetric and paediatric patients should be exercised until toxicological issues are resolved.

L1210 cells were allowed to interact with collagen or glass in serum-containing medium (time of cell-substrate interaction, tint, under stationary conditions, was within 2-25 min) or in serum-free medium (tint was 5 s-15 min). The relative number A of cells adhering under stationary conditions, and remaining adherent to the substrate despite experiencing a shearing force F, was determined. The following was found for cells adherent to collagen and glass, both in the presence and absence of serum in the medium. The number A increases with the value of tint and tends to reach a plateau. The plateau value depends on adhesion conditions (presence or absence of serum). When adhesion occurred in serum-containing medium (F congruent to 0.1 X 10(-13)N), function A(tint) increased up to 15 min. The plateau values were in the ratio of 2:1 for cells adherent to collagen and glass, respectively. When adhesion took place in serum-free medium, the function A(tint) increased within the first 20 or 130s for cells adhering to glass or collagen, respectively. The value of A(tint) increased up to the effective interaction time, teff int, i.e. the time after which a plateau was reached at 100% adhesion. This meant that after tint greater than or equal to teff int all cells were in adhesion with glass and collagen despite the application of the greatest shearing force, F congruent to 2 X 10(-9)N. The values of teff int for cells adherent to collagen and glass were in the ratio of 6:1, respectively. The value of A decreases with the value of F for cells adherent to substrate in the absence of serum when tint less than teff int. The function A(F) for cells adherent to collagen and glass in the presence of serum, but not in the absence of serum, can be described by the equation: A = a/square root F + c, where a and c = constant greater than 0. The values of a were in the ratio of 2:1 for cells adherent to collagen and glass, respectively. The Brownian motion of cells interacting with both substrates in the absence of serum ceased. The times during which cell motion persisted for cells interacting with collagen and glass, respectively, were in the ratio of 2.5:1.","['Kowalczynska, H M', 'Nowak, M']","['Kowalczynska HM', 'Nowak M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Blood', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Collagen', 'Culture Media', '*Glass', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",,1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1984 Mar;66:321-33.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,,,,,,,

Enhancement by lysosomotropic amines and carboxylic ionophores.,9359-64,"The kinetics of cytotoxicity induced by ricin and a series of immunotoxins consisting of ricin A-chain coupled to antibodies against cell-surface antigens has been studied. The inhibition of protein synthesis in cells treated with immunotoxins or ricin occurs after a lag period. The rate of protein synthesis decreases according to a mono-exponential function, indicating a first-order process. With increasing concentration of immunotoxin, a maximal rate of inhibition is reached. The inactivation rate induced by immunotoxins was much slower than that achieved with ricin, even when products were compared on a basis of an identical number of molecules bound per cell, demonstrating the real higher efficacy of ricin. The time required to reduce protein synthesis by 90%, denoted T10, was 1.4-1.6 h with ricin, 60 h with anti-T65 immunotoxin on CEM human T leukemia cells (T65 positive), 65 h with anti-p97 immunotoxin on SK-MEL 28 human melanoma cells (p97 positive), and 20 h with an IgM anti-Thy 1.2 immunotoxin on WEHI-7 mouse T leukemia cells (Thy 1.2 positive). In this latter case, when the IgM antibody was replaced by an IgG anti-Thy 1.2, a 5-fold increase in the inactivation rate was obtained, demonstrating the importance of the binding moiety for the immunotoxins. Lysosomotropic amines such as ammonium chloride, chloroquine, and methylamine and carboxylic ionophores such as monensin, which are known to interfere with the uptake of certain macromolecules, strongly increased the rate of protein synthesis inhibition by all immunotoxins tested and increased 4-50,000-fold the sensitivity of cells to the immunotoxin. Enhancement in the inactivation rate was as much as 7-10-fold when either of these compounds was added, generating T10 values comparable to those of ricin.","['Casellas, P', 'Bourrie, B J', 'Gros, P', 'Jansen, F K']","['Casellas P', 'Bourrie BJ', 'Gros P', 'Jansen FK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amines/*pharmacology', 'Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Pepstatins/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Ricin/*immunology']",,1984/08/10 00:00,1984/08/10 00:01,['1984/08/10 00:00'],"['1984/08/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42707-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Aug 10;259(15):9359-64.,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Pepstatins)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '11076-29-2 (Streptomyces pepsin inhibitor)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'J97339NR3V (leupeptin)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)', 'V6Y2T27Q1U (pepstatin)']",,,,,,,,,

The antigenic cell surface phenotype of these clones defined by panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) was analyzed by flow microfluorometry (FMF) using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS II) and compared with the known stable phenotype of the parent cell line. The antibody panel consisted of eight MAb against melanoma-associated antigens, two MAb against monomorphic determinants of HLA-DR (la) and HLA-ABC, respectively, one MAb against the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) and one MAb against carcinoembryonic antigen used as control. A remarkable heterogeneity in terms of qualitative and quantitative expression of the cell surface antigens studied was observed among and within the different clones. The single-cell origin of the clones was assessed by comparing the clonogenic cell frequency, determined by limiting dilutions in microculture plates, with the cloning efficiency observed in Petri dishes. Both techniques using methylcellulose medium gave the same percentages of growing colonies. Cells from four Me43 clones were recloned in methylcellulose and the phenotype of five randomly selected subclones from each clone was analysed using the same panel of monoclonal antibodies.

Immunoperoxidase staining of bone marrow showed that these antigens are mainly expressed by monocytes and blast cells. Treatment of bone marrow cells with those antibodies which extensively inhibited spleen colony formation and with rabbit complement abolished the ability of progenitor cells to form colonies in soft agar. Quantitative absorption studies distinguished the antigens recognized by two of the anti-stem cell monoclonal antibodies from those detected by anti-H-2k 11-4.1 monoclonal antibody.

Km values for the transport of adenosine, uridine, and thymidine in erythrocytes were 2.2, 195, and 199 microM, while Vmax were 2.9, 118, and 96.5 pmol/min/10(6) cells, respectively. In L5178Y cells, Km values of 14.8 and 23.1 microM and Vmax of 389 and 176 pmol/min/10(6) cells were obtained for adenosine and uridine, respectively. For erythrocytes, the Ki values of BAU were 127, 124, and 198 microM using adenosine, uridine, and thymidine as the substrate; and those of BBAU, 14.1 and 19.2 microM for adenosine and uridine, respectively. In L5178Y, the Ki values of BAU were 202 and 234 microM, and those of BBAU, 39.8 and 27.9 microM for adenosine and uridine, respectively. These data indicate that, in two cell types, Ki values for BAU and BBAU did not vary regardless of the substrate used; that the values of Ki are different for the erythrocytes and L5178Y cells; and that BBAU is at least 5-fold more potent than BAU as an inhibitor of nucleoside transport. The inhibitory effects on the efflux of preloaded uridine indicate that BAU and BBAU are inhibitors, rather than permeants, of the nucleoside transport system.","['Lee, K H', 'el Kouni, M H', 'Chu, H S', 'Cha, S']","['Lee KH', 'el Kouni MH', 'Chu HS', 'Cha S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Uracil/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Uridine/*metabolism', 'Uridine Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Sep;44(9):3744-8.,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0H851I3O9D (5-benzylacyclouridine)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', '82857-75-8 (5-benzyloxybenzylacyclouridine)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.3 (Uridine Phosphorylase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']","['CA 09204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Uptake and retention of daunomycin were significantly enhanced in sensitive and resistant P388 leukemia cells when they were perfused with LDL-daunomycin complex relative to free drug. The interaction of the LDL-daunomycin complex with P388 cells appeared to be through a LDL-specific pathway since competition with free LDL but not high-density lipoprotein significantly reduced daunomycin uptake. The LDL-daunomycin complex was cytotoxic to both daunomycin-sensitive and daunomycin-resistant P388 sublines.

The potentiating effect of verapamil on DNA single-strand breaks in vitro was concentration dependent, relevant to clinically achieved levels of Ca2+ antagonists, and showed good correlation with enhanced cytotoxicity when VP-16 and Ca2+ antagonists were combined in soft agar colony-forming assays. Onset of verapamil activity was observed within 20 min of addition to cells whether VP-16 had been preincubated with cells or was added simultaneously with the Ca2+ blocker. The presence of the extracellular Ca2+ antagonist was required for potentiation as evidenced by the rapid reversal of increased DNA single-strand breaks when cells were washed free of verapamil. Neither ethyleneglycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid nor the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 altered verapamil potentiation of VP-16-induced DNA damage, suggesting that this Ca2+ antagonist acts by a mechanism other than by inhibition of Ca2+ influx. In isolated L1210 nuclei, verapamil did not enhance VP-16- or 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6-O-2-thenylidene-beta-D- glucopyranoside (VM-26)-induced single-strand breaks suggesting a requirement for the intact cell. Even though VM-26 was 5- to 10-fold more potent than VP-16, verapamil potentiated the DNA damage caused by these two epipodophyllotoxins in L1210 cells to the same extent when these agents were used at equipotent doses. Potency differences between VM-26 and VP-16 were evident in isolated nuclei suggesting that nuclear binding or activation is a more important parameter than were previously reported membrane transport differences. The significance of Ca2+ antagonist potentiation of VP-16-induced DNA damage is discussed in terms of overcoming resistance to epipodophyllotoxins and characterizing more precisely the intracellular disposition, binding, and activation of VP-16.","['Yalowich, J C', 'Ross, W E']","['Yalowich JC', 'Ross WE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Gallopamil/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Verapamil/*toxicity']",,1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Aug;44(8):3360-5.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '39WPC8JHR8 (Gallopamil)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",['CA-00537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

When cells were transferred to drug-free medium after 4-hr exposures, vinblastine was released much more rapidly from cells than was vincristine, and by 0.5 hr after resuspension of cells, the amount of vincristine associated with the cells was greater than the amount of vinblastine and remained so for up to at least 6 hr.","['Ferguson, P J', 'Phillips, J R', 'Selner, M', 'Cass, C E']","['Ferguson PJ', 'Phillips JR', 'Selner M', 'Cass CE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/physiopathology', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Vincristine/metabolism/*toxicity']",,1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Aug;44(8):3307-12.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast, 27 of 28 Wistar rats (96%) developed lymphomas of mostly thymic origin. The 3 lymphomas derived from the SHR bore only a Thy 1.1 antigen, whereas most of the lymphomas derived from Wistar rats carried not only a Thy 1.1 antigen but also a guinea pig red blood cell rosette receptor and a T (W3/13) antigen. Grafts of 1-week-old male Wistar thymus into the neonatal female SHR promoted a differentiation of thymocytes and markedly increased the incidence of the lymphomas which were positive for a guinea pig red blood cell rosette receptor and a T-antigen; grafts of 1-week-old SHR thymus, however, failed to do this. These results suggest that the low incidence of GLV-induced lymphomas in SHR may correlate closely with the absence or decreased numbers of the rosette-forming thymocytes which are presumably the target cells for GLV.","['Takeichi, N', 'Suzuki, K', 'Kobayashi, H']","['Takeichi N', 'Suzuki K', 'Kobayashi H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hypertension/complications/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/*immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/complications/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Rats, Mutant Strains', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology/transplantation']",,1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Aug;44(8):3241-4.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,

Didemnin B inhibits protein synthesis and DNA synthesis much more than RNA synthesis and is in general more potent than didemnin A. Time course studies reveal that the action of didemnin B is rapid and cannot be reversed after 2 h in contact with the cells. The inhibition of protein synthesis is almost superimposable to that of L1210 cells growth. DNA synthesis is also markedly inhibited. These results collectively suggest that didemnin B acts differently, at least in part, from other depsipeptide antibiotics and its biological effect is primarily mediated through its inhibition of protein synthesis and to a lesser extent its inhibition of DNA synthesis.","['Li, L H', 'Timmins, L G', 'Wallace, T L', 'Krueger, W C', 'Prairie, M D', 'Im, W B']","['Li LH', 'Timmins LG', 'Wallace TL', 'Krueger WC', 'Prairie MD', 'Im WB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Depsipeptides', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ionophores', 'Kidney Cortex/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microvilli/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Sodium/metabolism']",,1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(84)90095-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(84)90095-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1984 Jul;23(3):279-88. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(84)90095-8.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '4LSZ9C5HOB (didemnins)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,,,,,,,

If indomethacin treatment was initiated prior to transplantation of the tumor or 2 weeks post-transplantation, and continued throughout the disease process, there was no effect on either the course of the disease or mortality. Injection of similar doses of indomethacin into mice bearing advanced B16 melanoma tumors did not result in increased mortality. Therefore, metabolic changes which occur in the leukemic animals may uniquely alter host sensitivity to this non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent.

Its clinical significance in relation to their differential diagnosis and prognosis.,702-8,"Forty-eight patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 12 patients with small (well differentiated) lymphocytic lymphoma (WDL) were histologically evaluated for their pattern of bone marrow (BM) involvement. Four different types of BM infiltration were recognized: nodular (N), interstitial (I), nodular and interstitial (mixed) and diffuse (D). The pattern of BM involvement was compared with the clinical, laboratory, and survival status in all patients. The extent of the disease in CLL patients, was determined by the Rai and the International Workshop on CLL Staging Systems, while in WDL patients the Ann Arbor staging system was used. In the CLL group the N pattern was found in 8%, the I in 33%, the mixed in 31%, and the D in 27% of the patients. Based on the International Workshop on CLL Staging System, the I pattern of BM involvement was more frequently found in Stage A (56%), the mixed in Stage B (68%), and the D in Stage C disease (90%). All CLL patients with D pattern required treatment from the beginning, contrary to CLL patients with the other patterns, in whom therapy was required in less than 50%. Similarly, deaths were more common in the D pattern in whom therapy pattern than in the other patterns.

The comparison of toxicity of 20 to 50 mg/kg CNCC and 15 to 30 mg/kg (2-chloroethyl)ribopyranosyl-3-nitrosourea RFCNU at Day 1 and Day 5 showed that the bone marrow microenvironment was modified by the effect of oil and was further impaired by CNCC in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast RFCNU had less effect on the microenvironment. Similarly, the bone marrow GM-CFUc population was reversibly impaired by CNCC in a dose-dependent fashion, and again RFCNU had less effect. In the spleen both drugs provoked a higher toxic effect than in the bone marrow; on Day 1 they decreased the GM-CFUc population by 1 to 2 log. On Day 5 a compensatory regeneration was obtained in all cases except the highest tolerable CNCC dose, whose effect was more delayed.","['Blazsek, I', 'Mathe, G', 'Maral, R', 'Jasmin, C']","['Blazsek I', 'Mathe G', 'Maral R', 'Jasmin C']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Count', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*toxicity', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects']",,1984/06/30 00:00,1984/06/30 00:01,['1984/06/30 00:00'],"['1984/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0041-008x(84)90150-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1984 Jun 30;74(2):250-7. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(84)90150-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '56194-22-0 (RFCNU)', ""77469-44-4 (N,N'-bis((2-chloroethyl)nitrosocarbamoyl)cystamine)""]",,,,,,,,,

These small lysine derivatives of MTX are of interest as putative breakdown products of MTX-poly(L-lysine). Inhibition of DHFR in a cell-free assay was decreased only 3-fold relative to MTX, indicating that gamma-substitution by up to three lysines is well tolerated for binding. On the other hand, toxicity toward L1210 murine leukemia cells in culture decreased up to 120-fold relative to MTX as the lysines increased in number from one to three, suggesting that uptake across the cell membrane becomes difficult when positively charged lysines are at the gamma-position. Growth inhibition of H35 rat hepatoma cells was decreased 40- to 60-fold relative to MTX, but in H35R0.3 cells, which have normal DHFR content but are 180-fold MTX resistant by virtue of a transport defect, the lysine derivatives were only 3- to 7-fold less toxic than MTX. When the adducts were given to L1210 leukemic mice by twice-daily injection for 10 days, an increase in life span (ILS) of 80-100% was observed at 40 mg/kg (equivalent to 20-30 mg/kg of MTX).

Granule concentrations of approximately 1 microgram/ml granule protein were adequate to lyse 100% of the erythrocytes, while the nucleated cells required up to 100 micrograms/ml granule protein to achieve complete lysis. Cytoplasmic granules purified from noncytotoxic lymphoid cells did not contain detectable cytolytic activity; purified granules from rat mast cells and rat liver lysosomes likewise failed to display cytolytic activity. However, granules prepared from normal rat peripheral blood LGL were cytolytic. Granule-mediated lysis of erythrocytes and nucleated cells was complete within 3 min at room temperature. The lytic activity required calcium at concentrations of 10(-4)-10(-2) M; magnesium or barium failed to replace calcium, while strontium could replace calcium at 10(-3)-10(-2) M when nucleated cells were the target. Exposure of LGL tumor granules to calcium before the addition of target cells resulted in an inactivation of granule cytolytic activity over the course of 20 min at room temperature. Granule cytolytic activity was heat and Pronase sensitive, and could be solubilized by 2 M salt. Examination of granules exposed to calcium in the electron microscope using negative staining showed that calcium treatment of granules results in the formation of ring-shaped structures previously described to be associated with LGL-mediated cytotoxicity. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the cytotoxic processes mediated by LGL are a secretory event characterized by the release of cytolytic material from the cytoplasmic granules after triggering by a surface receptor. The results further suggest that the ring structures visible in the electron microscope are associated with the lytic event.","['Henkart, P A', 'Millard, P J', 'Reynolds, C W', 'Henkart, M P']","['Henkart PA', 'Millard PJ', 'Reynolds CW', 'Henkart MP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/isolation & purification', 'Drug Stability', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lysosomes/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",PMC2187435,1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.160.1.75 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1984 Jul 1;160(1):75-93. doi: 10.1084/jem.160.1.75.,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,

These included respiration, glucose transport, microtubule content, glutathione content, production of H2O2 or superoxide anion, and the activities of a variety of different enzymes. Several cellular activities or measurements were inhibited or lowered after SIRSox-treatment, including cell division, microtubule content, glutathione reductase activity, and thioredoxin reductase activity; inhibition was partially reversed by the sulfhydryl reducing agent dithiothreitol. Protein sulfhydryl content of P815 mastocytoma cells and several other cell types was lowered by 35 to 45% after exposure to SIRSox. Protein sulfhydryl loss was also partially restored after incubation with dithiothreitol. Sulfhydryl loss was not due to cell lysis. In addition, treatment of crude cellular particulate fractions with SIRSox resulted in protein sulfhydryl loss and formation of protein sulfenyl derivatives.

Cutaneous leukemic lesions may be concomitant with or preceding the diagnosis of systemic leukemia. Therefore, skin biopsy may be helpful in detecting the leukemia and may facilitate the work-up. Leukemia cutis probably is a dissemination of systemic leukemia to the skin, and the demonstration of leukemia in skin is associated with a very poor prognosis.","['Su, W P', 'Buechner, S A', 'Li, C Y']","['Su WP', 'Buechner SA', 'Li CY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology']",,1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(84)70145-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(84)70145-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1984 Jul;11(1):121-8. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(84)70145-9.,,,,,,,,,,

This material was collected from the 811 NPC patients treated in our hospital from March 1958 to 1972. The results obtained are presented as follows: Concurrent pregnancy had a disastrous effect on the prognosis of NPC patients giving a five year survival of only 11% (1/9). Of the eight patients who died, six did so within one year of the treatment, five of whom died of distant metastases. This fatal outcome was not altered by any measure we instituted. This adverse influence was not observed in the subsequent group, yet the time of gestation seemed to be relevant to the prognosis. Two of the three patients who became pregnant within one year of the treatment died of disease, those who became pregnant beyond the second year after irradiation had the best prognosis. All seven patients who became pregnant after the second year of treatment survived. The frequency of pregnancy did not influence the prognosis of patients if the conception occurred beyond the second year in the subsequent group. All the five patients who gave birth to two, three or even four children survived for more than five years without any evidence of tumor. A total of 21 children were born to the patients of these two groups. They have been followed regularly for 10 to 20 years. No deformity, or retardation in growth or mentality was discovered, nor was there any evidence of radiation tumor or leukemia observed.","['Yan, J H', 'Liao, C S', 'Hu, Y H']","['Yan JH', 'Liao CS', 'Hu YH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Carcinoma/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Myelitis/etiology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Time Factors']",,1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0360-3016(84)90387-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1984 Jun;10(6):851-5.,,,,,,,,,,

Comparative studies of dihydrofolate reductase enzyme and cell growth inhibition following treatment with methotrexate and F-MTX suggest that the two agents possess similar modes of action.

These atypical patients had clinically milder disease and significantly less anemia than the usual patient (mean hemoglobin, 12.1 g/dl versus 9.4 g/dl; P = 0.016), although neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were comparable. Mortality and infection rates were similar in both groups. Infections were common in all patients, but opportunistic infections and septicemia were rare in patients prior to initiation of therapy. Two thirds of the patients who received corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic agents had serious infections, with a 50% mortality rate. Nearly 70% of the neutropenic patients (leukocyte count less than 1000) who received any form of treatment had a serious infection.

Three preleukemic patients with -7 who were studied during transformation to overt leukemia all developed additional cytogenetic abnormalities. According to the two-step or multistep hypothesis for malignant transformation, the prolonged preleukemic course in patients with -7 as the only abnormality could represent a premalignant stage, in which further evolution is required for development of overt leukemia.

The specific activities per microgram of protein were 2-10 times greater in the microvesicles than in the plasma membrane fraction, suggesting localization in specific membrane domains. Sucrose density centrifugation gave a single protein peak (density 1.14) with congruent procoagulant and platelet aggregating activities. Both activities required the extrinsic pathway, as shown by studies with factor-deficient plasmas, and both were inhibited by heating (60 min/100 degrees C), by reduction and alkylation, and by incubation of the microvesicles with rabbit anti-bovine brain tissue factor antibody. These observations were confirmed using microvesicles from the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, which are known to contain tissue factor activity. The results suggest that both procoagulant and proaggregating activities are causally related through the presence of tissue factor in the microvesicles. Studies with the Baumgartner perfusion apparatus showed that U87MG microvesicles increased the size of adherent thrombi nearly tenfold and that these thrombi were associated with nucleated cells from the blood. The increase in adherent thrombi did not occur if perfusion was carried out in the presence of DAPA, confirming the role of thrombin in their formation.","['Bastida, E', 'Ordinas, A', 'Escolar, G', 'Jamieson, G A']","['Bastida E', 'Ordinas A', 'Escolar G', 'Jamieson GA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Dansyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Glioma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Perfusion', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Thromboplastin/immunology/*physiology', 'Thrombosis/*chemically induced']",,1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83855-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Jul;64(1):177-84.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Dansyl Compounds)', '55381-72-1 (dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']","['CA 305538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 05737/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The residual transport activity, designated NBTI -resistant transport, was inhibited by NBTI only at concentrations above 1 microM (ID50 = 10-50 microM). S49 cells exhibited only NBTI -sensitive uridine transport, whereas Novikoff cells exhibited only NBTI -resistant uridine transport. In all instances NBTI -sensitive transport correlated with the presence of between 7 7 X 10(4) and 7 X 10(5) high-affinity NBTI binding sites/cell (Kd = 0.3-1 nM). Novikoff cells lacked such sites. The two types of nucleoside transport, NBTI -resistant and NBTI -sensitive, were indistinguishable in substrate affinity, temperature dependence, substrate specificity, inhibition by structurally unrelated substances, such as dipyridamole or papaverine, and inhibition by sulfhydryl reagents or hypoxanthine. We suggest, therefore, that a single nucleoside transporter can exist in an NBTI -sensitive and an NBTI -resistant form depending on its disposition in the plasma membrane. The sensitive form expresses a high-affinity NBTI binding site(s) which is probably made up of the substrate binding site plus a hydrophobic region which interacts with the lipophilic nitrobenzyl group of NBTI . The latter site seems to be unavailable in NBTI -resistant transporters. The proportion of NBTI -resistant and sensitive uridine transport was constant during proportion of NBTI -resistant and sensitive uridine transport was constant during progression of P388 cells through the cell cycle and independent of the growth stage of the cells in culture. There were additional differences in uridine transport between cell lines which, however, did not correlate with NBTI sensitivity and might be related to the species origin of the cells. Uridine transport in Novikoff cells was more sensitive to inhibition by dipyridamole and papaverine than that in all other cell lines tested, whereas uridine transport in CHO cells was the most sensitive to inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents.","['Plagemann, P G', 'Wohlhueter, R M']","['Plagemann PG', 'Wohlhueter RM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/*pharmacology', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ovary', 'Rats', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Uridine/*metabolism']",,1984/06/13 00:00,1984/06/13 00:01,['1984/06/13 00:00'],"['1984/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(84)90548-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(84)90548-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1984 Jun 13;773(1):39-52. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(84)90548-0.,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",['GM 24468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Although a remission rate of 65% has been reported, the toxicity was severe and was possibly related to the high plasma concentrations of Ara-C (about 100 microM) reached during 1 h infusion. It has been postulated, however, that the intracellular enzymes which convert Ara-C into the active metabolite cytosine arabinoside triphosphate (Ara-CTP), are saturated at plasma concentrations of about 10 microM. We calculated that this level could be reached with an intermediate dose of 0.5 g/m2 Ara-C, given in a 1 h infusion (ID Ara-C). Subsequently 15 patients with ANLL (12 in relapse and three refractory to conventional therapy) were treated with ID Ara-C every 12 h for 6 d in combination with doxorubicin and vincristine. The overall remission rate was 80%. The median duration of bone marrow depression was 20 d (range 14-29 d) and side effects were comparable to conventional treatment.

The results demonstrate that the dansyl-L-lysine analogue of methotrexate was rapidly transported into L1210 cells where it formed a high-affinity, fluorescent complex with intracellular dihydrofolate reductase.","['Susten, S S', 'Kempton, R J', 'Black, A M', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Susten SS', 'Kempton RJ', 'Black AM', 'Freisheim JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Dansyl Compounds/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fluorescence', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",,1984/06/15 00:00,1984/06/15 00:01,['1984/06/15 00:00'],"['1984/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(84)90555-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(84)90555-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1984 Jun 15;33(12):1957-62. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(84)90555-0.,"['0 (Dansyl Compounds)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '83416-29-9', '(N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxy-N(10)-methylpteroyl)-N-(epsilon)-(5-(N,N-dimethylamino', ')-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)lysine)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA 11666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

It is found that the ways in which measurement error is most likely to mislead are through downward bias in the estimated regression coefficients and through distortion of the shape of the dose-response curve. The magnitude of the bias and the power for testing the hypothesis of no effect are evaluated for several dose treatments including the use of grouped and ungrouped data, analyses with and without substituting 600 rad for estimated doses exceeding this value, and analyses which exclude doses exceeding 200 rad. The calculations are based on a model in which the error distributions are assumed to be log normal with standard deviations that are 0, 30, and 50%, respectively, of the true dose values. Results are limited to a dose-response function which is linear on total dose. It is found that the commonly applied practice of substituting 600 rad for doses exceeding this value definitely reduces bias in the presence of error. Restricting analyses to doses less than 200 rad reduces bias even more but at the price of considerable loss of power. Both the bias and the power for analyses based on grouped data are very close to the respective bias and power with ungrouped data.","['Gilbert, E S']",['Gilbert ES'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Models, Biological', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Injuries/*mortality', 'Radiometry/methods', 'Regression Analysis', 'Urban Population']",,1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1984 Jun;98(3):591-605.,,,,,,,,,,

The neoplasms most commonly metastasizing to the brain are those of lung, breast, renal and skin (melanoma) origin. In two-thirds of cases, intracranial metastases are located within the brain parenchyma, while the remaining third involves the pachymeningeal envelopes. Leptomeningeal metastases are rare and develop mainly from leukemia, lymphomas and breast carcinoma. The route of spread to the central nervous system is usually hematogenous but occasionally direct involvement from adjacent bone or pachymeningeal metastases can occur. Median survival from clinical presentation usually doesn't exceed a few months. However brain metastases are the cause of death only in about 15% of patients. This is probably due because they occur late in the course of the natural history of the disease, when metastatic deposits in other viable organs have already developed. Due to this reason, systematic assessment of metastases to the brain is not advisable in all patients but it should be restricted to symptomatic patients and to asymptomatic patients affected by small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung, who could benefit from prophylactic brain irradiation. In symptomatic patients, plain skull X-ray, electroencephalography and computed tomography represent appropriate diagnostic tools to provide accurate informations about number, size, site and morphological characteristics of brain metastases.","['Boccardo, F', 'Comelli, G', 'De Menech, R', 'Mina, G', 'Zanardi, S']","['Boccardo F', 'Comelli G', 'De Menech R', 'Mina G', 'Zanardi S']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,IM,"['Angiography', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*secondary', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,1984/05/31 00:00,1984/05/31 00:01,['1984/05/31 00:00'],"['1984/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Med. 1984 May 31;75(22-23):1369-78.,,,Storia naturale e stadiazione delle metastasi cerebrali.,,,,,,,

In this paper, we attempted to relate these differences to the expression of F-SFFV and Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) functions. Teratocarcinoma phenotype hybrids retained F-SFFV-and F-MuLV-related provirus sequences. They did not express F-SFFV- or F-MuLV-related RNA or proteins. The hybrids differentiated to endoderm-like cells on exposure to retinoic acid or hexamethylene-bis -acetamide. These cells, in contrast to the teratocarcinoma phenotype (uninduced) cells expressing SSEA-1-like antigens, did not express SSEA-1-like antigens; they formed typical, prekeratin-staining cytoskeletal structures and could be induced to release mouse interferon. The differentiating cells, but not the uninduced teratocarcinoma hybrids, were infected productively with F-MuLV or the F-MuLV--F-SFFV complex. They, however, did not express endogenous F-SFFV. Endogenous F-SFFV functions could not be rescued by infection with F-MuLV. Induction of teratocarcinoma hybrids with retinoic acid did not activate endogenous F-MuLV or F-SFFV transcription or protein synthesis. These data demonstrated two control mechanisms of Friend virus repression: one which acted trans during formation of the cell hybrids and was maintained only in teratocarcinoma phenotype cells and the other which acted cis and was still operative during induction of endodermal differentiation.","['Asche, W', 'Colletta, G', 'Warnecke, G', 'Nobis, P', 'Pennie, S', 'King, R M', 'Ostertag, W']","['Asche W', 'Colletta G', 'Warnecke G', 'Nobis P', 'Pennie S', 'King RM', 'Ostertag W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hybrid Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Teratoma/*genetics']",PMC368841,1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.4.5.923-930.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1984 May;4(5):923-30. doi: 10.1128/mcb.4.5.923-930.1984.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,

Thus, nonexpresser variants were isolated at high frequency from murine cell lines by immunoselection directed against virus-encoded cell surface glycoproteins and also simply by subcloning cells from lines which had been cultured for many generations. Studies of independently infected cell clones indicate that shutdown is a property of the cell line rather than of the specific proviral site. Nucleic acid blot analyses suggest that shutdown correlates with decreased transcription. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicates that other murine retroviruses also shut down frequently in murine but not in rat cells and that shutdown of replication-competent murine leukemia viruses with accompanying loss in interference to superinfection may be the rate-limiting reaction enabling cells to acquire multiple proviruses in their chromosomes. High-frequency shutdown in vivo would have important pathological consequences.","['Bestwick, R K', 'Machida, C A', 'Polonoff, E', 'Kabat, D']","['Bestwick RK', 'Machida CA', 'Polonoff E', 'Kabat D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics']",PMC368838,1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.4.5.908-914.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1984 May;4(5):908-14. doi: 10.1128/mcb.4.5.908-914.1984.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Neonatal mice of several strains were inoculated with Friend ecotropic virus (F-Eco) and analyzed for the presence of mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) virus or DNA restriction enzyme fragments which were specific for Friend MCF virus (F-MCF). MCF virus was detected within 2 weeks of inoculation in NFS /N mice and at about 2 months after inoculation in BALB/c mice.

Thus, although MCF viruses were associated with F-Eco erythroblastosis in NFS /N and BALB/c mice, they were not necessary for F-Eco-induced lymphoid or myeloid leukemias in C57BL mice. To investigate the association between resistance to erythroblastosis and absence of MCF virus, C57BL mice were inoculated with pseudotypic mixtures of F-Eco plus F-MCF; MCF virus replicated well in these mice, but the mice remained resistant to erythroblastosis. Furthermore, in genetic crosses between C57BL and NFS /N or BALB/c, some mice inherited resistance to F-Eco erythroblastosis without inheriting the C57BL resistance to the generation of MCF viruses.

For this to be feasible, the growth of leukemic progenitor cells should be inhibited by these compounds, with the inhibition preferentially affecting leukemic over normal hemopoietic progenitor cells. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was chosen as a differentiation inducer and was studied for its effect on the growth of leukemic colony-forming cells (L-CFU) in ten patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in comparison with normal myeloid colony-forming cells (CFU-C). Growth inhibition of both L-CFU and CFU-C was observed with TPA concentrations as low as 10(-10) M. With increasing concentrations of TPA, survival of L-CFU tended to decline more precipitously than that of CFU-C. In eight of ten patients, inhibition of L-CFU was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) than CFU-C with TPA concentrations of 10(-9) M or higher.

A ""zero-time,"" temperature-independent binding of VM-26 to cells, attributable to adsorption on the cell membrane or to solvation in the membrane, varied independently of the sensitivity of cell lines to the drug as measured by the extracellular concentration of drug required to inhibit growth of a subline by 50% at the end of 24 hr (IC50). The IC50 values varied from 22 nM VM-26 for parental cells to 45 microM VM-26 for the most resistant subline. After subtraction of the zero-time values, the initial rates of influx for VM-26 (extracellular concentration, 20.5 microM) and the apparent equilibrium constants for the flux of drug across the cell membrane correlated inversely with the logarithm of the IC50 values. Cellular steady-state levels of VM-26, initial rates of efflux of the drug, and cellular levels of nondiffusible drug varied independently of the IC50 values but in relation to each other. The efflux of VM-26 from the sublines was faster than from the parental cells at both 4 degrees and at 37 degrees.

Cultures representing the first spectrum were from 20 times to 1200 times more resistant to VM-26 than were cultures of parental cells. At 24 hr after addition of 22 nM VM-26 to the medium, the growth of cultures of parental cells was inhibited by 50%. Increases in resistance to VM-26 among the sublines coincided with increases in population doubling times. When cells were transferred to drug-free medium, there was a sharp decrease in resistance over the first 10 days; the subsequent decline in resistance, over 2 to 4 months, correlated with a decrease in population doubling times. The second spectrum of resistant sublines arose from the first spectrum after the latter had been maintained for about 1 year on various selective concentrations of VM-26. Resistance to VM-26 by this second group of sublines was from 400 times to over 2000 times greater than that of the parental cell line. Doubling times for these resistant cell populations were similar to the normal rate of the parental cell line. Eight sublines were characterized by two chromosomes with homogeneously staining regions, while the remaining subline had a single chromosome with this anomaly. One of the regions appeared on a submetacentric chromosome in seven of the nine sublines, while the other was on an acrocentric chromosome. These observations indicate that a longer doubling time facilitated selection of increasingly resistant sublines but was not essential for the resistance of sublines in the second spectrum.","['Lee, T', 'Roberts, D']","['Lee T', 'Roberts D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Teniposide/*toxicity']",,1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jul;44(7):2981-5.,"['957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']","['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 35319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Neither ABMFPP nor ABOFPP alone had any significant activity against P388 leukemia. However, a marked synergistic effect was observed when a single i.p. injection of CY at 24 hr after tumor inoculation (10(6) cells/mouse) was followed by multiple i.p. injections of either ABMFPP or ABOFPP . For instance, the increase of life span was about 180% when animals received both CY (150 mg/kg) and ABMFPP (125 mg/kg/injection) as compared to 100% increased life span when animals received CY alone, and 0% increased life span when animals received ABMFPP alone. Also, 80% of the animals were long-term survivors (greater than 30 days) when animals received the combination therapy as compared to 20% survivors when animals received CY alone. The synergistic effect exhibited by ABMFPP or ABOFPP correlated positively to the initial reduction of tumor burden by CY. The optimal gap between CY and pyrimidinone administration was one day. The best therapeutic response was observed when pyrimidinone was given every 4 days for a total of 7 injections; however, other schedules and dosing frequencies also gave significant responses. The synergistic effect was also observed with B 16 melanoma when animals received the combination therapy.

Therefore, in this model, the testicular leukemia cells do not appear to reside in a pharmacological sanctuary.","['Hoots, W K', 'Nelson, J A']","['Hoots WK', 'Nelson JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jun;44(6):2464-6.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA-28034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Of 26 cell lines tested, 17 were sensitive to IFN-alpha, and the main cell cycle effect was accumulation in the G0-G1 phase. One Burkitt's lymphoma line, Namalwa, showed a decreased rate of progress through S without any G0/G1 accumulation. Three of the cell lines were also tested with IFN-beta and with IFN-alpha 2 produced by recombinant DNA technology. The latter IFN did not affect one of the cell lines; otherwise, the results were similar to those of IFN-alpha.

Correlations were noted between reactivity with FBL -L, and DR and Fc receptor expression. Among continuous cell lines, FBL -L bound with high intensity to a majority of HL-60 and U937 cells. The less well differentiated myeloblast cell lines, KG-1, KG1a , and HL-60 blast II, exhibited less FBL -L binding than HL-60 and U937. A moderate proportion of K562 cells exhibited low level binding of FBL -L. Several lymphoblastic cell lines exhibited a pattern of low intensity binding that was distinguishable from the high intensity binding pattern of the myeloblastic lines. FBL -L reactivity of U937 was enhanced by induction of differentiation with leukocyte conditioned medium, but not dimethylsulfoxide.

The antibody was in the form of IgG from sheep antiserum. Three of the 4 cases showed a significant fall in blood lymphocyte count. On one occasion most of the residual circulating lymphocytes were apparently dead. However on all occasions the cell counts rebounded to near pre-infusion levels within one week. Viable lymphocytes recovered from the blood after infusion always showed evidence of antigenic modulation: a diminished level of surface idiotype in a patched distribution, with an accompanying refractoriness to lysis by anti-idiotype plus complement. When cultured in vitro blood lymphocytes from three of the four patients revealed an appreciable export of idiotypic Ig. These 3 patients showed plasma levels of idiotypic Ig up to 400 micrograms ml-1, reduced by plasma exchange prior to infusion. The fourth patient had a level of less than 4 micrograms ml-1, and was the only one in whom free antibody could be found in the plasma after infusion. These cases demonstrate two major factors which thwart antibody attack on leukaemic cells--extracellular antigen and antigenic modulation--as well as problems relating to sparseness of surface antigen, recruitment of effectors, and exhaustion of effectors.","['Gordon, J', 'Abdul-Ahad, A K', 'Hamblin, T J', 'Stevenson, F K', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Gordon J', 'Abdul-Ahad AK', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Stevenson FK', 'Stevenson GT']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunization Schedule', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/analysis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC1976721,1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1984.88 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1984 May;49(5):547-57. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1984.88.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

The materials were obtained by percutaneous aspiration of lung and heart immediately after death or directly from lung and heart after opening the thorax at autopsy. Anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed for isolation. Twenty-one strains of anaerobic bacteria were recovered (3.4% of the 603 total isolates) from the lungs for 368 cases, and 16 strains (6.5%) of anaerobic bacteria were isolated among 247 strains from heart blood for 314 cases.

The same bacterium was isolated from both the lungs and heart blood of four autopsied patients; from three of these patients only B. fragilis was isolated. Enteric gram-negative bacilli and Pseudomonas were common in the patients with nosocomial pneumonia; these patients usually had received many antibiotics before death.

Both methodologies require developing additive-damage dose-effect models. Additive-damage dose-effect models are derived assuming (a) each radiation comprised by the combined exposure produces initial damage called critical damage that could lead to the radiobiological effect of interest; (b) doses of different radiations that lead to the same level of radiobiological effect (or risk) can be viewed as producing the same amount of critical damage and being indistinguishable as far as the effects of subsequently administered radiation. Derived dose-effect functions that describe the risk per individual, conditional on radiation dose, are called risk functions. The methodologies allow the use of known radiation-specific risk functions to derive risk functions for combined effects of different radiations. The risk functions for combined exposure to different radiations are called global risk functions. For sequential exposures to different ionizing radiations, the global risk functions derived depend on how individual radiation doses are ordered. Global risk functions can also differ for sequential and simultaneous exposure. The methodologies are used to account for some previously unexplained radiobiological effects of combined exposure to high and low linear-energy-transfer radiations.","['Scott, B R']",['Scott BR'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Alpha Particles', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neutrons', '*Radiation Effects', 'Risk', 'Stochastic Processes']",,1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1984 Apr;98(1):182-97.,,,,,,,['NASA: 84194987'],,,

The long-term persistence of the immunoprotective properties of the hybrid cells toward murine leukemia was investigated by using cells that had been in continuous culture for approx. 36 months. (A/J X C3H/HeJ)F1 mice injected previously with hybrid cells in continuous culture and then challenged with up to 10(7) ASL-1 cells survived longer (p less than 0.001) than mice who had not received hybrid cells previously.

The median survival time of F1 mice injected simultaneously with 10(7) hybrid cells and 200 or 2000 ASL-1 cells was significantly (p less than 0.001) prolonged as well, although the differences between experimental and control groups are less pronounced than if the hybrid cells were injected before challenge with ASL-1 cells. The hybrid cells like those freshly prepared continue to be rejected by histocompatible precipients. In no instance has there been evidence of a progressively growing tumor of hybrid cells in immunocompetent F1 mice. Hybrid cells like those investigated previously do form rapidly growing metastasizing tumors in immunodeficient nu/nu (BALB/c) or X-irradiated (550 R) F1 mice.

In all four lines, noncytotoxic concentrations of the phorbol ester caused an extensive reduction in the number of cells expressing cALL surface antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The disappearance of these markers correlated with the loss of cell proliferation. In one of the cell lines, NALL-1, TPA treatment gave rise to a significant increase in Ia-like antigen and antigen T-101, markers which represent more advanced stages of cell maturation. However, surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobins, indicators of mature B cells, were not detectable. Antigen 3A1, specific for myeloid and for T cells, antigen Leu-4, specific for T cells and antigen CM1, specific for monocytes, were also absent. In all cell lines, exposure to TPA resulted in an approximately two-fold increase in acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activity. The emergence of these phenotype changes was not altered upon repeated washing of the TPA-treated cells.

RNA preparations from the peripheral blood leukocytes of human leukaemias of various types were assayed for the relative abundance of the mRNA homologous with a cellular oncogene, c-myc. All types of leukaemia except chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) showed varying levels of myc-related RNA; the highest concentrations occurred in cell populations in which blast cells predominated. In contrast, a recombinant plasmid (pCG14), isolated from a cDNA recombinant plasmid library that represented polyadenylated RNAs from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), hybridized with an mRNA whose occurrence is diagnostic of CGL leukocytes. This mRNA was also found in normal bone marrow cells; in both bone marrow and in CGL leukocytes, pCG14-homologous RNA occurs only in cells around the myelocyte stage in differentiation. It is suggested that these probes, and others for mRNAs whose occurrence is specific to a particular cell lineage and/or stage in differentiation, detect a new series of potential diagnostic markers.

In all cases, this therapy produced bone marrow aplasia. One patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, refractory to prior treatment, achieved a complete remission which lasted for 16 weeks. Another patient with lymphoblastic lymphoma had a greater than 50% reduction in his mediastinal mass which lasted for less than 1 month. At multiple points during therapy, the bone marrow S-phase fraction was measured by flow cytometry and autoradiography. In five patients, the proportion of cells in S phase increased during the first few days of the infusion but then returned to base line, concomitant with an overall reduction in the number of bone marrow blasts. Cytoreduction was evaluated by the technique of W. Hiddemann, B. D. Clarkson, T. Buchener, M. R. Melamed, and M. Andreeff (Blood, 59: 216-225, 1982). The magnitude of tumor cell kill ranged from 0.7 to 3.6 logs of blasts/cu mm of bone marrow. The data demonstrate that dThd is able to induce a complete remission in a patient with acute leukemia previously refractory to treatment. However, because of the very large drug quantities, fluid volumes, and the prolonged course required to produce the necessary tumor cell kill, this treatment approach is too impractical to be used extensively.","['Blumenreich, M S', 'Woodcock, T M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Chou, T C', 'Vale, K', ""O'Hehir, M"", 'Clarkson, B D', 'Young, C W']","['Blumenreich MS', 'Woodcock TM', 'Andreeff M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Chou TC', 'Vale K', ""O'Hehir M"", 'Clarkson BD', 'Young CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Thymidine/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use']",,1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 May;44(5):2203-7.,['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)'],"['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM 97274/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Didemnin B was more potent than was didemnin A against B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia in vivo, and B was also approximately 20 times more cytotoxic than was didemnin A in vitro. Therefore, didemnin B was studied in greater detail for its biochemical and cellular effects. Didemnin B inhibited the in vitro growth of B16 greater than L1210 greater than V-79 cells = human foreskin fibroblast = 9L greater than Chinese hamster ovary cells. Didemnin B was more lethal to exponentially growing B16 cells (50% lethal dose for a 2-hr exposure, 17.5 ng/ml) than to plateau-phase cells (50% lethal dose for a 2-hr exposure, 100 ng/ml). After a 24-hr exposure, the 50% lethal dose for exponential- and plateau-phase B16 cells was 8.8 and 59.6 ng/ml, respectively. Chinese hamster ovary cells were not killed even at 25,000 ng/ml. Mitotic cells were the least sensitive to didemnin B, and cells became more sensitive as they progressed into G1 and S phase. However, since cells in all phases were killed, didemnin B cannot be considered a phase-specific agent. Didemnin B inhibited the synthesis of protein more than that of DNA, with much less inhibition of RNA synthesis. Cell progression studies showed that high doses (300 ng/ml for 2 hr or 100 ng/ml for 24 hr) of didemnin B ""froze"" the cells in their respective phases with complete inhibition of cell progression or growth. At low doses (10 ng/ml for 2 hr or 3 ng/ml for 24 hr), the cells were blocked at the G1-S border thereby increasing the percentage of G1 cells and decreasing the percentage of S-phase cells.

Both MCTIC and CNU decompose to yield a 2-chloroethyldiazo species which is capable of alkylating DNA. At equimolar concentrations, all three drugs possessed similar in vitro cytotoxicities; at equitoxic concentrations, they produced similar levels of DNA interstrand cross-linking. The time course for cross-link formation was different for CNU when compared with MCTIC and M&B 39565, with peaks at 6 hr (CNU) and 9 hr (M&B 39565 and MCTIC). This study suggests that M&B 39565 is cytotoxic against L1210 leukemia cells as a consequence of DNA interstrand cross-link formation, probably via its breakdown product MCTIC.","['Gibson, N W', 'Erickson, L C', 'Hickman, J A']","['Gibson NW', 'Erickson LC', 'Hickman JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Ethylnitrosourea/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Imidazoles/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Nitrogen Mustard Compounds', 'Protein Binding']",,1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 May;44(5):1767-71.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '2365-30-2 (1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea)', '28177-14-2 (5-(3-(2-chloroethyl)triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'E3U7286V3W (mitozolomide)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",,,,,,,,,

We have found that brief exposure of Friend cells to dimethyl sulfoxide (as well as butyric acid or hexamethylene-bisacetamide) induces an early cellular activity required for erythroid differentiation which is detected only by fusion with ultraviolet-irradiated cells. The induction process of this activity consists of at least two distinct stages. In the first stage, the reaction proceeds without supply of metabolites from the medium and exhibits sensitivity to tumor promoters. The second stage is tightly coupled to cellular metabolic activity, notably protein synthesis. Under normal conditions, the induced activity is short-lived, suggesting turnover of the molecules responsible for this activity. There appears to be a signal produced following dimethyl sulfoxide pulse which acts as an inducer for this activity.

In control mice the major proportion of the lipoproteins was found in the HDL density range, but on days 4 and 5 following tumor transplantation a gradual shift into the LDL density range was observed. At the same time the apolipoprotein E content increased at the expense of apolipoprotein A-I. VLDL became moderately elevated. On days 6 and 7 all lipoproteins except VLDL reached extremely low values. The C-apolipoproteins showed a remarkable shift in their relative proportions. Plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity showed no significant alteration in the course of tumor growth, but the triacylglycerol lipases in postheparin plasma were strongly decreased. Lipoprotein lipase had already started to decline on day 2 following tumor transplantation. However, when assayed in the presence of heat-inactivated control plasma, a decrease was not observed before day 5. This is suggestive of a depletion of a plasma cofactor preceding the final disappearance of the enzyme itself, and is compatible with the changing apolipoprotein C pattern. Hepatic lipase showed a 50% reduction between days 3 and 4. The lipoprotein alterations in tumor-bearing mice are explained as a direct consequence of the decreased lipase activities.","['Damen, J', 'Van Ramshorst, J', 'Van Hoeven, R P', 'Van Blitterswijk, W J']","['Damen J', 'Van Ramshorst J', 'Van Hoeven RP', 'Van Blitterswijk WJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Apolipoproteins/blood', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Lipase/*blood', 'Lipids/blood', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*blood', 'Lipoproteins/*blood', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase/blood']",,1984/04/18 00:00,1984/04/18 00:01,['1984/04/18 00:00'],"['1984/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2760(84)90331-X [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(84)90331-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1984 Apr 18;793(2):287-96. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(84)90331-x.,"['0 (Apolipoproteins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 2.3.1.43 (Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",,,,,,,,,

Ara-C alone inhibited cloning in concentrations of greater than 10 nM, with a steep drop in colony formation observed between 10 and 100 nM. dGuo and ara-C synergistically inhibited cloning; the combination of ineffective concentrations of dGuo (10-50 microM) and ara-C (less than or equal to nM) inhibited cloning by 40-70%. In K562 cells, dGuo is metabolized by both nucleoside kinase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), resulting in augmentation of both the GTP pool (to more than 200% of control after a 3 hr incubation with 500 microM dGuo) and the dGTP pool (to more than 2700% of control after 3 hr with 500 microM dGuo). dGuo (50-500 microM) caused a decrease in the dCTP and dTTP pools and an increase in the dATP pool. Synergistic concentrations of dGuo plus 10 nM ara-C augmented the ara-CTP pool up to 800% of control after 3 hr to levels equivalent to those observed after incubation with 500 nM ara-C alone. Incorporation of 10 nM ara-CTP into DNA also increased in the presence of dGuo (up to a maximum of 300% of control), but only to a level that approximated the value observed with nM ara-C alone. The disparity between enlargement of the ara-CTP pool and augmentation of ara-C incorporation into DNA is consistent with the observation of Steinberg et al. [Cancer Res. 39, 4330 (1979)] that high concentrations of dGTP may inhibit DNA polymerase activity. Thus, synergy between dGuo and ara-C is multifactorial, possibly involving inhibition of DNA polymerase by elevated dGTP and ara-CTP pools and augmented incorporation of ara-C into DNA.","['Akman, S A', 'Ross, D D', 'Joneckis, C C', 'Fox, B M', 'Bachur, N R']","['Akman SA', 'Ross DD', 'Joneckis CC', 'Fox BM', 'Bachur NR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation']",,1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(84)90513-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(84)90513-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1984 Apr 1;33(7):1059-63. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(84)90513-6.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,,,,,,,,

Equipotent inhibition was also produced by spermine whereas spermidine and putrescine were less effective. MGBG appeared to act as a competitive inhibitor in respect to carnitine. Even though MGBG and spermine equally effectively depressed palmitate oxidation in muscle homogenates in vitro, a striking difference existed between the compounds as regards their effects on fatty acid oxidation in cultured tumor cells. Micromolar concentrations of MGBG distinctly impaired palmitate utilization also in cultured L 1210 leukemia cells, whereas similar concentrations of spermine markedly enhanced the oxidation of the fatty acid. The inhibitory effect of MGBG in cultured tumor cells was, at least partly, reversed upon addition of exogenous carnitine.

Amino-terminal 23,000-Da V8 protease fragments from gp52 of the Lilly-Steeves strain of SFFV and from gp70 of a pathogenic F-MCF isolate produced tryptic peptide fingerprints in which the mobilities of the trypsin-generated peptides were identical. The carboxyl-terminal, 21,000 Da, V8 protease fragment of gp52, however, has a unique fingerprint that contained a single highly charged trypsin-generated peptide. This peptide migrated to the same position as a peptide in F-MCF p15E, thus indicating that the p15E-related nucleotide sequences, that follow the large envelope deletion, are translated in the same reading frame as those in the standard p15E. Although R peptide determinants can be detected in F-MCF Pr15E, they could not be detected in gp52.

Radiolabelled AP binds to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), erythrocytes, and cells derived from human non-T, non-B acute lymphocytic leukaemia. The AP cell binding is specific in that it is dose-dependent and can be blocked both by excess cold AP and by Helix pomatia galactan, although it cannot be blocked by an equal amount of the monosaccharide galactose. In vitro studies of human PBMC immune responses demonstrated that AP inhibits PBMC proliferation responses to mycobacterial purified protein derivative and to phytohaemagglutinin and the humoral, antibody response to pokeweed mitogen. The AP-induced suppression of non-specific antibody production by human PBMC was dependent on the time at which AP was added to the culture. AP was suppressive if added in the first 48 h of the 7-day culture, and the suppression could not be reversed by washing the cells after the exposure to AP. The mechanism of AP-induced immunosuppression is still unclear, but human SAP circulates as a pair of pentameric rings, having ten identical subunits that bind to galactose polymers, and our present data suggest that AP affects the immune response through its properties as a lectin.","['Li, J J', 'Pereira, M E', 'DeLellis, R A', 'McAdam, K P']","['Li JJ', 'Pereira ME', 'DeLellis RA', 'McAdam KP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Amyloid/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Galactans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Kinetics', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/immunology', 'Serum Amyloid P-Component']",,1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1984.tb00924.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1984 Mar;19(3):227-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1984.tb00924.x.,"['0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Galactans)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '0 (Serum Amyloid P-Component)']","['AI-18102/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM26501/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The reason for the increase in steady state is that the relative decline in efflux is greater than the decline in influx. Analysis of the concentration dependence of steady-state methotrexate accumulation in D-glucose-deprived cells indicates a linear relationship consistent with a one-carrier active transport model. Similar data in nondeprived cells is highly nonlinear and strongly supports the postulate that under physiological conditions influx and efflux of methotrexate are mediated by separate carrier systems. These results indicate that the efflux system, preferentially transporting methotrexate under normal conditions, cannot operate in the absence of D-glucose, whereas the influx system is only partially inhibited under conditions of glucose deprivation.","['Dembo, M', 'Sirotnak, F M', 'Moccio, D M']","['Dembo M', 'Sirotnak FM', 'Moccio DM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,IM,"['Animals', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Sodium Azide', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01872527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1984;78(1):9-17. doi: 10.1007/BF01872527.,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The antigen detected by L22 is not present on normal peripheral blood cells, but is present on cells stimulated by various mitogens. The proportion of L22+ cells correlates closely with blastogenesis and 125I-uridine uptake. L22 precipitates a 89,500-dalton antigen under reducing conditions, and a 180,000-dalton antigen under nonreducing conditions. The immunoreactivity, molecular weight of the antigen, sequential immunodepletion, and blocking experiments suggest that L22 reacts with the transferrin receptor, although it did not specifically block transferrin. L22 reacts with a variable proportion of cells from virtually all human myeloid, lymphoid, and solid tumor cell lines tested. Expression of the antigen is relatively constant within a given cell line and varies to only a limited extent with DNA content or cell cycle. The antigen has been identified on rare lymph node cells in certain reactive and malignant conditions. The antibody reacts with a variable number of peripheral blood cells in certain cases of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, but does not react with peripheral lymphocytes from patients with inflammatory conditions. Its reactivity suggests possible utility in subclassification of leukemias, and perhaps in immunotherapy, in view of the limited reactivity with nonproliferating cells.","['Dillman, R O', 'Shawler, D L', 'Frisman, D M', 'Fox, R L', 'Royston, I']","['Dillman RO', 'Shawler DL', 'Frisman DM', 'Fox RL', 'Royston I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1984;3(1):26-38.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)']","['CA 28746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CB-84250/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PHSGM-01798/PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

A potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and of vaccinia virus multiplication in mouse L929 cells.,4353-8,"Neplanocin A, a novel cyclopentenyl analog of adenosine, is a naturally occurring antibiotic which exhibits significant antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in mice (Yaginuma, S., Muto, N., Tsujino, M., Sudate, Y., Hayashi, M., and Otani, M. (1981) J. Antibiot. 34, 359-366). In the present study we demonstrate that neplanocin A is also a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1) having a Ki of 8.39 nM for the purified bovine liver enzyme. Analysis of the apparent irreversible inactivation of AdoHcy hydrolase by neplanocin A indicates that the drug is a tight binding inhibitor, exhibiting a stoichiometry of one molecule of inhibitor to one molecule (tetramer) of enzyme. In addition, we show that neplanocin A is a potent inhibitor of vaccinia virus (WR) multiplication in monolayer cultures of mouse L-cells. Concentrations of the drug as low as 0.5 and 1.0 microM in the culture medium produce 84 and 95% inhibition of plaque formation, respectively, while exhibiting little toxicity to the host cells. The inhibition of virus multiplication by neplanocin A coincides with a rapid inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase activity in the infected cells and a subsequent 10-fold increase in the intracellular AdoHcy/S-adenosylmethionine ratio. These findings suggest that the antiviral actions of this compound may be related to an inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent macromolecular methylation reactions which are essential to the production of new virus particles (e.g. viral messenger RNA).","['Borchardt, R T', 'Keller, B T', 'Patel-Thombre, U']","['Borchardt RT', 'Keller BT', 'Patel-Thombre U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Hydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",,1984/04/10 00:00,1984/04/10 00:01,['1984/04/10 00:00'],"['1984/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)43053-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Apr 10;259(7):4353-8.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '72877-50-0 (neplanocin A)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",['GM-29332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Evaluation of the results 4 years later indicated that certain patients, especially those with large mediastinal masses and/or hilar disease, or who were spleen positive, were having higher recurrence rates than patients without these characteristics. In 1974, a new approach to treatment for patients with large mediastinal masses or spleen positive disease was instituted which involved treating the whole lung or hemi lung in patients with large mediastinal masses and/or hilar disease, and the liver in patients who had positive spleens. The results of this treatment modification are reported in this study. Long term follow-up reveals that this approach has led to a recurrence free survival and overall survival similar to that noted in patients treated with combined modality treatment without the obvious risk of subsequent leukemia related to combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition, the complications of the treatment are tolerable and do not demonstrate an increase over patients not treated in this manner. Radical radiation therapy is recommended as a treatment of choice for Stage IA, IIA, and IIIA patients with or without splenic involvement, and with or without hilar disease and/or large mediastinal masses with appropriate radiation field modification to adjust for disease extent.","['Levitt, S H', 'Lee, C K', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Levitt SH', 'Lee CK', 'Bloomfield CD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Laparotomy', 'Liver/*radiation effects', 'Lung/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",,1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(84)90013-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(84)90013-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1984 Feb;10(2):265-74. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(84)90013-0.,,"['CA-15548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The stability of a cloned murine tumor was examined during growth in standard tissue culture or in media containing the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Analysis of subclones from the appropriate tumor populations revealed that growth of the L5178Y-F9 clone in 100 ng/ml TPA and 0.1% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) for 2 days yielded a tumor which exhibited increased cellular heterogeneity for susceptibility to both syngeneic and allogeneic natural antibodies (NAb). Subsequent exposure of TPA- and DMSO-treated cells to two cycles of syngeneic NAb-mediated cytolysis resulted in tumor populations which expressed a reduced sensitivity to syngeneic NAb. Thus the elements of tumor variant generation and selection were demonstrated by means of this approach, and repeated cycles of the TPA treatment and NAb cytolysis produced tumor cells with a reduced susceptibility not only to NAb in vitro but also to anti-tumor natural resistance (NR) measured in a tumor elimination assay in vivo. These observations extend the support for the notion that tumor progression can proceed through variant generation and selection. Furthermore, the association of tumor variant generation with exposure to the combination of TPA and DMSO, both non-mutagens, offers a model for studying non-mutagenic mechanisms of tumor development.","['Chow, D A']",['Chow DA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Genetic Variation', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Biological', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1984/04/15 00:00,1984/04/15 00:01,['1984/04/15 00:00'],"['1984/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910330419 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1984 Apr 15;33(4):541-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910330419.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,

Cyclophosphamide is an anticancer drug that is activated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450, while the products of cyclophosphamide metabolism by cytochrome P-450 can be metabolized by other hepatic enzymes. Carbon tetrachloride pretreatment has been found to increase the in vivo antitumor activity of cyclophosphamide against murine leukemia P-388. Carbon tetrachloride did not, however, affect the direct cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide or 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide to cells in culture. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed a delayed plasma disappearance of cyclophosphamide after carbon-tetrachloride pretreatment with an apparent initial half-time of 20.4 min compared to 9.0 min in non carbon-tetrachloride-pretreated mice. Plasma levels of total alkylating activity and plasma 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide increased more slowly and reached a lower peak, but were maintained for a longer time period in mice pretreated with carbon-tetrachloride than in untreated mice. The half-life for plasma elimination of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in untreated mice was 12 min and in carbon-tetrachloride-pretreated mice 27 min.

Measurement of the clonogenic potential in vitro of leukemic marrow cells together with their cytogenetic type may help to distinguish between patients who should and should not receive cytosine arabinoside/anthracycline antibiotic remission induction therapy and patients who do and do not require intensive remission consolidation chemotherapy.","['Preisler, H D', 'Azarnia, N', 'Marinello, M']","['Preisler HD', 'Azarnia N', 'Marinello M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/physiology']",,1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Apr;44(4):1712-7.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,

Initial studies were performed in six rhesus monkeys with chronic indwelling Ommaya reservoirs. Following intraventricular administration of 0.2 mg of AZQ, elimination was monoexponential with half-lives of 32 and 39 min in ventricular and lumbar CSF, respectively. AZQ clearance (0.2 ml/min) was 5-fold greater than estimated CSF bulk flow, indicating that transcapillary passage and/or metabolism may be important clearance mechanisms for this drug. In spite of its rapid clearance from ventricular CSF, a substantial peak AZQ concentration was achieved in lumbar CSF (12 microM), which was 7 times higher than the peak ventricular CSF level (1.7 microM) achieved following i.v. AZQ administration (16 mg/sq m). Moreover, the mean area under the CSF concentration-time curve in ventricular CSF was 20-fold greater following intraventricular versus i.v. AZQ dosing, despite an 80-fold-lower dose. AZQ was not detectable in plasma (less than 0.06 microM) following intraventricular administration. No animals demonstrated clinical evidence of acute neurotoxicity. Subsequently, intraventricular AZQ was administered to a patient with refractory meningeal leukemia. Intraventricular AZQ (0.5 mg) resulted in a peak ventricular (56 microM) CSF level which was 80-fold higher than ventricular CSF levels achieved following systemic AZQ administration of a dose of 24 mg/sq m in humans. Moreover, intraventricular AZQ yielded substantial CSF levels without detectable plasma concentrations. These data suggest that intraventricular administration of AZQ is feasible and may have pharmacological advantages over systemic administration for the treatment of meningeal neoplasia.","['Zimm, S', 'Collins, J M', 'Curt, G A', ""O'Neill, D"", 'Poplack, D G']","['Zimm S', 'Collins JM', 'Curt GA', ""O'Neill D"", 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Aziridines/administration & dosage/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Azirines/*cerebrospinal fluid', '*Benzoquinones', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclohexenes', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Protein Binding']",,1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Apr;44(4):1698-701.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Azirines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '800-24-8 (2,5-bis(1-aziridinyl)-3,6-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-benzoquinone)']",,,,,,,,,

Induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and 6-thioguanine (DAT) yielded CR in 65% of 283 patients with ANLL, aged 16-69. For patients aged 60-69, the CR rate was 58%. Of 184 patients in CR, 146 patients were then randomized to receive either maintenance therapy with weekly cytosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine alone (69 patients) or two courses of reduced doses of DAT 1 mo apart, before commencing the same maintenance program (77 patients). Consolidation therapy resulted in hematologic toxicity, but was not lethal in any of the eligible patients. Patients receiving consolidation plus maintenance therapy experienced a longer CR duration (40 wk) and disease-free survival at 2 yr (28%) than did those patients receiving maintenance therapy alone (34 wk and 14%, respectively). These differences are not statistically significant. These results suggest that approaches to consolidation therapy employing reduced doses of the induction therapy regimen can have, at best, only a small benefit. For consolidation therapy to provide substantial improvement in CR duration, intensive regimens with non-cross-resistant drugs will be required.","['Cassileth, P A', 'Begg, C B', 'Bennett, J M', 'Bozdech, M', 'Kahn, S B', 'Weiler, C', 'Glick, J H']","['Cassileth PA', 'Begg CB', 'Bennett JM', 'Bozdech M', 'Kahn SB', 'Weiler C', 'Glick JH']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Random Allocation', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects', 'United States']",,1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85550-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Apr;63(4):843-7.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']","['CA 15488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

The daily and total doses of mitoxantrone ranged from 1.8 mg/m2 to 4.3 mg/m2 and from 7.5 mg/m2 to 40 mg/m2, respectively. CR was achieved in three (33%) previously untreated and two (25%) in previously treated cases. PR occurred in five previously untreated and in two previously treated patients. The other five failed to respond the agent. The most serious adverse effect of the drug was myelosuppression, but it was reversible in all cases. In one patient irreversible EKG change was observed. All other adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia and diarrhea, were not serious and reversible. In conclusion, Mitoxantrone is effective in some cases with acute leukemia.","['Oguma, S', 'Tatsumi, Y', 'Hirayama, F', 'Tani, Y', 'Kubota, Y', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, H', 'Shibata, H', 'Masaoka, T']","['Oguma S', 'Tatsumi Y', 'Hirayama F', 'Tani Y', 'Kubota Y', 'Kanakura Y', 'Ueda T', 'Nakamura H', 'Shibata H', 'Masaoka T']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Marrow basophilia was significantly associated with myelodysplasia and sideroblastic anemia, but was not found in 37 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders.

Therefore, the consequences of discontinuing antibiotics when the presence of infection is doubted in this setting were evaluated. In 16 (3.7 percent) of 429 episodes of fever and granulocytopenia for which empiric antibiotic therapy was instituted, after approximately four days, persistence of both fever and granulocytopenia was found, and yet infection was prospectively classified at that time as ""doubtful."" The initial empiric antibiotic regimen was therefore discontinued after a mean of 4.8 (median 5.0) days. Discontinuation of antibiotics proved appropriate for half of the patients; eight patients received no systemic therapeutic antibiotics with no evidence of infection during a period of at least two weeks. The other eight patients had antibacterial antibiotics reinstituted within a mean of 2.4 days; six infections were subsequently demonstrable. Six of these eight patients also required or were believed to require antifungal therapy with intravenous amphotericin B for presumed fungal infections. Patients with relapsed leukemia or lymphoma and those with a likelihood of continued profound granulocytopenia (counts below 100/microliters) or both were the ones who tended to require reinstitution of antibiotics. Discontinuation of antibiotics when infection was considered doubtful despite persistence of both fever and granulocytopenia was, therefore, successful in eight of 16 patients. Reinstitution of antibiotics was required in the eight remaining patients.

The presence of clonal chromosomal aberrations in some (AN) or all (AA) metaphases of bone marrow cells was a fairly strong indication of poor prognosis, while the absence of abnormal metaphases (NN) was a favourable prognostic sign. 6 of 7 patients in the NN group entered complete remission (CR), as did 8 of 20 in the AN + AA group and 8 of 17 in the group with random loss of chromosomes (NNA). The median survival time for AN + AA patients was 4 months, while for patients without clonal aberrations (NN + NNA) it was 9 months. Of the cultural parameters studied, colony-stimulating activity (CSA) of peripheral leucocytes had the strongest correlation to prognosis. CSA greater than 1 was related to remission (P less than 0.01) and longer survival (P less than 0.05 at 4 months), while 8 patients with CSA less than or equal to 1 were all dead at 8 months. However, very high CSA values (greater than 20) indicate a poor prognosis. Although both chromosome analysis and CSA were of prognostic value, combining the 2 parameters did not improve the prognostic information, mainly because of covariation of NN and CSA greater than 1.","['Hornsten, P', 'Lindquist, R', 'Gahrton, G']","['Hornsten P', 'Lindquist R', 'Gahrton G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/mortality', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1984.tb01695.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1984 Mar;32(3):297-305. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1984.tb01695.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Withaferin A: relation of its structure to the in vitro cytotoxic effects on P388 cells.,31-6,"In vitro effects of withaferin A and its 9 new derivatives on P388 cells have been studied. The cytotoxicity was calculated from the utilization of precursors in protein and nucleic acid (NA) synthesis and from capacity to suppress cell proliferation. The most potent agents proved to be 4-dehydrowithaferin A and withaferin A diacetate exhibited an equal inhibitory effect on thymidine, uridine, and L-valine incorporation. They stopped cell proliferation and, at the same time, killed the cells. Cytotoxicity was found to be due to a double bond at position C2-3, by dissociating this bond the cytotoxicity markedly decreased in all derivatives. A dissociation of the double bond at C24-25 or a removal of OH group from C27 did not cause any significant changes in the biological effects of the derivatives. An addition of a carbonyl group at C4 increased the effects of the agent. An addition of OH groups to the molecule of withaferin A resulted chiefly in a qualitative change in the action of derivatives manifested by a significant decrease in L-valine inhibition. As withaferin A promptly reacted with L-cysteine, it was presumed that one of the possible target sites in the cell might be the SH groups of enzymes which react with the lactone and epoxide groups of the agent.","['Fuska, J', 'Fuskova, A', 'Rosazza, J P', 'Nicholas, A W']","['Fuska J', 'Fuskova A', 'Rosazza JP', 'Nicholas AW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ergosterol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Withanolides']",,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1984;31(1):31-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Withanolides)', 'L6DO3QW4K5 (withaferin A)', 'Z30RAY509F (Ergosterol)']",,,,,,,,,

We performed a retrospective review of 21 patients at Children's Memorial Hospital with LySLk diagnosed from Jan 24, 1977 to July 8, 1981 and of the surface markers on their leukemic cells at diagnosis. Surface markers identified included E-rosettes (E), surface immunoglobulin (Slg), and common ALL antigen (cALLA). Four patients were cALLA positive and E-rosette negative; nine patients were E-negative, cALLA negative; six patients were E positive, cALLA negative. In two patients E-rosettes could not be accurately determined because of a low percentage of lymphoblasts in the samples studied.

Thus it appears that the majority of children with LySLk have lymphoblasts which are cALLA negative. Patients who meet clinical criteria for LySLk but whose surface markers are E negative, cALLA positive may have a better prognosis and may represent a separate subgroup of patients with ALL and, therefore, should be given therapy appropriate for their prognostic classification by more standard criteria, such as white blood count, age, and sex.","['Morgan, E']",['Morgan E'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Rosette Formation', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950120104 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1984;12(1):4-8. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950120104.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,

The highest levels occurred in T helper-CLL and Thy-ALL, but high levels were also found in C-ALL, NPDLL transforming to DHL, DPDLL and DHL. A range of enzyme activities was found in the majority of types examined, with the widest range encountered in ALL, NPDLL and DHL. In DWDLL, a narrow range of dCMPase activities was found, with enzyme levels in the control range or moderately increased. Similarly, B-CLL exhibited a narrow range of enzyme activities, within that of the controls. The highest enzyme activity in HD was found in the highly malignant type - lymphocyte depleted HD. Statistically significant differences were found between the distribution of dCMPase activities in ALL and the chronic leukemias; and between favorable histologic types of non Hodgkin's lymphomas and the unfavorable DHL type. These data suggest that dCMPase activity is a marker of the clinical aggression of human lymphoid malignancies. Moreover, the marked variation in enzyme activity in each type of lymphoid malignancy suggests that this also applies to individual tumors as well. In view of the important role of dCMPase in pyrimidine metabolism and the profile of enzyme activities in leukemia and lymphoma, it is suggested that an inhibitor of dCMPase could be of clinical value in lymphoid malignancy.","['Ellims, P H', 'Medley, G']","['Ellims PH', 'Medley G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['DCMP Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology', 'Nucleotide Deaminases/*metabolism']",,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90040-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(1):123-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90040-7.,"['EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleotide Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.12 (DCMP Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,

Our studies of Fv-1 restrictive infection have shown a variable decrease in the accumulation of intracellular unintegrated form I viral DNA.

In addition, the kinetics of a liquid culture transformation system is presented in which at least 4% of the yolk sac cell population was transformed in a relatively synchronous fashion at 2 days after infection. The morphological transformation preceded an increased rate of cell proliferation. Cell separation procedures provided a 10- to 20-fold enrichment of target cells and demonstrated that the target cell population copurifies with macrophage colony-forming cells which are the committed progenitors to the macrophage lineage.

Study of the ID50 values of the S-deoxo analogues, as well as the compounds having the beta-sulfoxide function, indicate that the presence of an oxygen atom on the alpha-sulfur atom is essential.

Twenty-six patients had frank leukemia, 25 had no apparent leukemic cells, and 18 had focal residual leukemia. Of 25 patients whose bone marrow contained no detectable residual leukemic cells, 21 gained complete remission without further chemotherapy.

Although the hybridomas secreted only 0.8 to 1.5 micrograms/ml/10(6) cells in tissue culture, they produced 8 to 12 ml of ascites from two mice containing 1.7 mg/ml of human IgM. Partial purification was then easily accomplished by euglobulin precipitation. Two weekly injections of 100 micrograms of this material into BALB/c mice resulted in the development of both anti-idiotypic and anti-human IgM antibodies. This system overcomes the major hurdle of generating sufficient quantities of the human idiotypic Ig to immunize and screen for specific murine antiidiotypes, and provides the material to produce these therapeutically promising reagents rapidly for clinical trials.

In this study, the effect of EP on the metabolism of 45Ca2+ in these cells was examined. At 4 degrees C, an increased rate of 45Ca2+ uptake and efflux as well as an increase in the steady state level of 45Ca2+ in treated cells was observed. Exchange of 45Ca2+ from preloaded cells at 4 degrees C indicated that treatment with EP increased the size of a rapidly exchanging pool of 45Ca2+ from 5 to 12% of total 45Ca2+ in the cell. The effect of treatment with EP can be seen as increased exchange of extracellular 45Ca2+ with cellular Ca2+; however, an effect of EP on the net level of Ca2+ in these cells cannot be excluded. This investigation demonstrates one of the earliest effects of EP on erythroid cells and suggests that alterations in Ca2+ metabolism may contribute to the progression of erythroid cells to their final development.","['Sawyer, S T', 'Krantz, S B']","['Sawyer ST', 'Krantz SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Calcium Chloride/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroblasts/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice']",,1984/03/10 00:00,1984/03/10 00:01,['1984/03/10 00:00'],"['1984/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)43212-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Mar 10;259(5):2769-74.,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'M4I0D6VV5M (Calcium Chloride)']","['R01 AM-15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AM-07186/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

HCL cells also exhibit an eightfold increase in the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. These changes cannot be ascribed to increased rates of cellular proliferation in the HCL cells, nor are they a consequence of an increased rate of loss of newly synthesized cholesterol into the culture medium. The increased rate of cholesterol biosynthesis in HCL cells may result in an increase in their total cellular cholesterol content, as well as in an increase in their plasma membrane cholesterol:phospholipid molar ratio.

The first method was based on the determination of tritium release from 2'-deoxy[5-3H]uridine [( 5-3H]dUrd) or 2'-deoxy[5-3H]cytidine [( 5-3H]dCyd); the second method was based on an estimation of the amount of dCyd incorporated into DNA as dTMP.

There was a strong correlation between the inhibitory effects of the dThd analogs on the proliferation of L1210 cells on the one hand, and (i) their inhibitory effects on tritium release from [5-3H]dCyd (r = 0.926) and (ii) their inhibitory effects on the incorporation of dCyd into DNA dTMP (r = 0.921), on the other hand. Evaluation of tritium release from [5-3H]dCyd proved to be the most convenient method that has been described so far to measure thymidylate synthase activity and to follow the inhibitory effects of thymidylate synthase inhibitors in intact L1210 cells, since this method is rapid and very sensitive, and since it proved superior to the evaluation of tritium release from [5-3H]dUrd because it circumvents possible interactions of the inhibitors with thymidine kinase activity.","['Balzarini, J', 'De Clercq, E']","['Balzarini J', 'De Clercq E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*metabolism']",,1984/02/28 00:00,1984/02/28 00:01,['1984/02/28 00:00'],"['1984/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(84)90231-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(84)90231-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1984 Feb 28;785(1-2):36-45. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(84)90231-0.,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,

A thorough history and physical examination are the cornerstones of evaluation. Laboratory findings can be useful in diagnosis, as can response to therapy (eg, response to penicillin in gonococcal arthritis is often the only criterion for diagnosis, as the organism is difficult to culture). Patients with malignancy (especially leukemia) or who are immunosuppressed or otherwise debilitated are at particular risk for a septic cause of swelling. Infectious arthritis should be the first potential cause looked for in these patients as well as in patients with such preexisting joint diseases as rheumatoid arthritis.

A single high affinity transport system was found to be the only route for methotrexate uptake. This conclusion was derived from the observations that influx at high substrate concentrations (up to 50 microM) both reaches a single maximum value and can be inhibited by greater than 98% either by treatment of the cells with an active ester of methotrexate or by the direct addition of excess amounts of competitive inhibitors. Efflux, conversely, could be separated into three components. One of these routes was dependent upon extracellular anions and could be blocked by active ester treatment and, therefore, appeared to be the same transport system which mediates methotrexate influx. A second route was identified by its sensitivity to bromosulfophthalein, while a third component was insensitive to both active ester treatment and to bromosulfophthalein. When these efflux routes were quantitated in a buffered saline medium, the methotrexate influx carrier was found to account for the major portion (71%) of total efflux. The inhibitor-insensitive component contributed an additional 23%, while the remaining 6% was attributable to the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive route. The addition of glucose increased total efflux by 3-fold and caused a substantial change in the proportion of efflux that occurred via each of the three components. The major portion of efflux (46%) now occurred via the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive route, while the influx carrier contributed only 29% of the total. The inhibitor-insensitive route accounted for the remaining 25%. The opposite result was obtained with metabolic inhibitors which decreased total efflux but increased the contribution by the influx carrier to greater than 80%. The demonstration of multiple routes for methotrexate efflux and their differential sensitivities to alterations in energy metabolism thus provides a basis for explaining previously described asymmetries between the influx and efflux of methotrexate in mouse leukemia cells.","['Henderson, G B', 'Zevely, E M']","['Henderson GB', 'Zevely EM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tritium']",,1984/02/10 00:00,1984/02/10 00:01,['1984/02/10 00:00'],"['1984/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)43440-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Feb 10;259(3):1526-31.,"['0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (methotrexate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Injection of ara-C (200 mg/kg) leads to an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis and, thus, to a block of G1 cells at the G1-S border. This dose of ara-C kills a considerable fraction (at least 54%) of the L1210 cells. A double-labeling experiment with [3H]thymidine and [14C]thymidine which permits the distinction of cells in different cycle phases shows that ara-C kills the majority of cells in S phase, while only a minor fraction of G1 cells are lethally damaged. A multicompartment model is utilized to derive from the results of the double-labeling experiment the rates of cell loss out of the different cycle phases. Eighty-seven percent of the cells that are in S phase at the time of ara-C application and 21% of the cells in G1 are killed by ara-C. The repopulation of the tumor starts from the remaining G1 cells.

It has demonstrated activity against both intracranial and i.p. murine tumors and human tumor xenographs. We have conducted a Phase I trial of aziridinylbenzoquinone in 60 children with advanced cancer who were refractory to conventional therapy. The drug was given by slow i.v. push on a daily schedule for 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks. The dose range explored included 6 dose levels, ranging from 6 to 12 mg/sq m daily for 5 days in patients with solid tumors and leukemia, and in patients with leukemia, 20, 25, and 30 mg/sq m daily for 5 days. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting side effect. In patients with solid tumor the highest dose studied was 12 mg/sq m, and the median nadir white blood cell and platelet counts were 0.7 X 10(3) and 6.0 X 10(3)/microliter on Days 17 and 22, respectively. The median recovery day for white blood cells was 39. There may be some evidence of cumulative toxicity with prolonged thrombocytopenia. Other side effects were mild nausea, vomiting, and mucositis. Elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin were transient and dose dependent, occurring 3 to 4 weeks after drug administration. Of the 34 children with solid tumors, 33 were evaluable for hematopoietic toxicity, 3 were early deaths, and 31 receiving a total of 55 courses were evaluable for therapeutic response. Partial responses lasting 3 weeks to 6 months were seen in the 4 patients with Hodgkin's disease, and in a child with a metastatic spinal cord ependymoma. Fifty-two courses were given to 9 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 17 with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Of the 15 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia treated at doses greater than or equal to 25 mg/sq m/day for 5 days there was one early death and there were 2 M1 (less than or equal to 5% blasts with normal cellularity), 3 M2A (6 to 15% blasts), and 2 M2B (16 to 39% blasts) bone marrow responses lasting 1 to 3.5 months. Aziridinylbenzoquinone demonstrated activity against acute nonlymphocytic leukemia with maximal tolerated doses of 30 mg/sq m daily for 5 days. Its effect in Hodgkin's disease is encouraging; however, further study will be required to determine its efficacy in central nervous system cancers.

Six patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia who had relapsed after conventional or experimental therapy were given continuous i.v. infusions of dThd in conjunction with ara-C. dThd was started at 75 g/sq m/day (producing 1 mM plasma levels) and was given for 5 to 8 days until the proportion of bone marrow cells in S-phase (measured by autoradiography and flow cytometry) had increased and/or stabilized; then ara-C at 200 mg/sq m/day was begun. Twenty-four hr after initiation of ara-C therapy, the dThd dose was reduced to 30 g/sq m/day (plasma dThd, 0.1 to 0.6 mM). Both drugs were continued for 6 to 12 days until marrow aplasia or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Four patients with a base-line labeling index lower than 30% experienced a sustained increase in the S-phase fraction; two patients with a base-line labeling index higher than 30% experienced a reduction in the S-phase compartment during dThd infusion, in one case followed by an increase. The degree of S-phase arrest did not correlate with remission induction. In 5 patients, the flash incorporation of labeled ara-C into nucleoside triphosphate and deoxycytidine into DNA of bone marrow cells was measured. Three patients had a significant increase in the incorporation of deoxycytidine into DNA. Two of them achieved a complete remission. Increases in ara-C uptake were less impressive. A new technique was used to measure the absolute number of blasts present in the bone marrow. A decrease in leukemic cells between 0.9 and 2.6 logs10/mm was found at the end of the infusions. Three patients experienced greater than 2-log reduction. Two of them entered complete remission that lasted 6 weeks and 3 months, respectively. These correlations should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of patients treated. This study suggests that dThd, although of very limited therapeutic value by itself, may have potentiated the antitumor activity of ara-C to some extent. Whether this effect is of significance can only be determined by further studies.","['Blumenreich, M S', 'Chou, T C', 'Andreeff, M', 'Vale, K', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Young, C W']","['Blumenreich MS', 'Chou TC', 'Andreeff M', 'Vale K', 'Clarkson BD', 'Young CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Thymidine/*therapeutic use']",,1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Feb;44(2):825-30.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']","['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

However, because the hematotoxicity of nitrosourea is usually cumulative, we have studied the effect of injecting (chloro-2-ethyl)ribofuranosyl-3-nitrosourea (15 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.2 ml sterile oil C57BL X i.p. into DBA/2F1 mice for 5 consecutive weeks. The dose per injection represents the minimal dose necessary to show the maximal therapeutic efficacy on L1210 leukemia. Bone marrow cellularity and histology, spleen weight, bone marrow and splenic pluripotent stem cells, and colony-forming units committed to granulocyte-macrophage differentiation were measured 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days after the last injection in treated and control mice receiving oil only. No morphological or histological changes were found in the spleen and bone marrow of treated mice. In both organs, the number of splenic pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells decreased by about 1 log 1 day after the last injection but rapidly returned to normal values on Days 4 to 14. Granulocyte-macrophage-committed precursors were affected in both organs, at 20% of control values for bone marrow and 5% of control values for spleen on Day 1, with a transient and partial recovery on Day 4 followed by a second drop to 20 and 25% on Day 14. This effect on granulocyte-macrophage precursors contrasts with the absence of significant effect when the same treatment is used on peripheral white blood cell counts.

This suggests that age-related changes are involved in development of leukemia. Prostaglandin biosynthesis was therefore studied in 24-hr cultures in vitro at 37 degrees of peritoneal macrophages, splenocytes, thymocytes, bone marrow, and lymph node cells. AKR mice of 2, 6, and 8 to 12 months of age were studied. Prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 were measured. In cultures of peritoneal macrophages and cells from spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes, the biosynthesis of all five prostaglandin moieties was higher in those cultures prepared from 8- to 12-month-old spontaneously leukemic mice in comparison with those from 2-month-old nonleukemic AKR mice. However, when leukemia was transplanted in 3-month-old AKR mice, synthesis of all five compounds was reduced significantly in cultures of peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes prepared from these 3-month-old leukemic mice. The present data demonstrate abnormalities in prostaglandin synthesis by various cells of the immune system in leukemic mice. However, the nature of these changes was different in cultures of cells from spontaneously leukemic mice from those with transplanted leukemia. Age-related increases in prostaglandin synthesis by various lymphoid cells from spontaneously leukemic AKR mice (8 to 12 months old) occurred at a much earlier age than in BALB/c mice and may be related to the leukemic condition.","['Karmali, R A', 'Wustrow, T', 'Thaler, H T', 'Good, R A']","['Karmali RA', 'Wustrow T', 'Thaler HT', 'Good RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/*biosynthesis', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",,1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Feb;44(2):467-71.,['0 (Prostaglandins)'],,,,,,,,,
