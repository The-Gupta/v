To date, 24 affected families have been enrolled in the Cancer Family Registry of the National Cancer Institute, and 21 others have been reported in the literature. The major feature of the syndrome is an autosomal dominant pattern of breast cancers and sarcomas of bone and soft tissue at unusually early ages. Additional components of the syndrome appear to be brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma in children and adolescents. Family members are prone to develop multiple primary cancer. In addition to descriptive reports, the syndrome has been detected in segregation analysis of a consecutive series of children with soft tissue sarcomas; in studies of breast cancer among mothers of unselected children with sarcomas; and in prospective observation for new cancers in our previously reported families. Laboratory studies are in progress to seek the gene(s) associated with this syndrome of diverse cancers. Studies of this rare disorder may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the 5 component tumors, particularly breast cancer, the commonest cancer among women in the United States and elsewhere.","['Clinical Studies Section, National Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are now beginning to acquire the evidence to substantiate this hypothesis. The evidence comes from two particular sources, (i) genetic environmental interactions and (ii) specific constitutional chromosome aberrations. Cancer incidence varies throughout the world. This is often due to the interaction of an environmental agent with a genetically varied population. Using UV and ionising radiation as examples it is argued that some individuals are more susceptible to genetic damage by these agents. Moreover, the genetic lesions which are caused by these agents are now being shown to be relevant to cancer. In the radiosensitive syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia for example, specific chromosome rearrangements have been defined which seem likely to be directly involved in the development of leukaemia in these patients. The second line of evidence comes from the study of patients who have constitutional chromosome abnormalities associated with susceptibility to specific cancers. It has now been shown that these chromosome changes mark the location of genes which are involved in the development of cancer and that these same loci are also important in the non-familial forms of these diseases. Thus we are beginning to understand for the first time the mechanistic pathway that leads from environmental agents, through chromosome damage, to the alteration of specific genes which control the neoplastic process.","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute, Manchester, England, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association of this slowly progressive spastic paraparesis with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) enabled us to designate this clinical entity as HTLV-I-associated myelopathy or HAM. Later studies showed that 1) the geographical distribution of HAM follows that of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and 2) viruses detected in both disorders were identical by DNA blotting assay, but HAM and ATL are definitely expressed clinically as distinct from the other. In this regard, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) studies and the pattern of immune responsiveness seem to show a clear segregation of one from the other. As many initially studied cases have responded favorably to corticosteroids and had frequent perivascular cuffing in the spinal cord of a necropsied case, it is likely that, in part, immune events play a role in the pathogenesis. Our efforts are now directed to determining whether a) HAM is purely an autoimmune process, or b) a slow virus infection with a long incubation period may be the culprit.","['Kagoshima University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene has also undergone insertional mutagenesis by non-acutely transforming murine leukemia viruses in a number of hematopoietic tumors. The common denominator of these retroviral activations of c-myb appears to be truncation of the normal coding region at either or both ends. The role of point mutations in myb-induced leukemogenesis is currently unknown. The products of the c-myb gene and its altered viral counterparts are nuclear proteins, a large fraction of which are associated with the nuclear matrix. In addition, the myb gene products have short half-lives and bind DNA in vitro. These features suggest that myb may act by regulating DNA replication or transcription. Consistent with this notion, the expression of c-myb is cell cycle dependent in several cell types. However, the abundant expression of c-myb in the thymus is not similarly regulated and may serve a different function. The expression of c-myb appears not to be limited to hematopoietic tissues as previously thought and the nature of the hematopoietic specificity of transformation by v-myb is not currently understood. Nevertheless, hematopoietic growth factors and their receptors appear to play an important role in such transformation. Two new experimental systems for studying myb have recently been described. First, the discovery of a myb-related gene in Drosophila should allow the application of powerful classical and molecular genetic approaches. The functional similarity of this distantly related gene to the much more closely related avian and mammalian myb genes is unknown. Second, recent studies of murine myb in normal and abnormal hematopoiesis offers several advantages relative to the avian system, such as in-bred animal strains, a wealth of specific cell-surface markers, and cloned hematopoietic growth factor and receptor genes. Isolation or construction of an acutely transforming murine myb retrovirus may thus be very useful. Several obvious goals for future research will be to define the function of myb proteins within the nucleus, to understand the regulation of myb expression during the cell cycle, to establish which molecular alterations are essential for converting c-myb into a transforming gene, and the determine the role of myb in human malignancies.","['Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90024.']",['CA-10197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using somatic cell hybrid panels, the mammalian homolog of the 5' v-ets-domain (ets-1) was mapped to chromosome 11 in man, to chromosome 9 in mouse, and to chromosome D1 in cat. The mammalian homolog of the 3' v-ets domain (ets-2) was similarly mapped to human chromosome 21, to mouse chromosome 16, and to feline chromosome C2. To better define the human proto-ets domains, the genomic DNA was molecularly cloned and sequences analyzed. The ets-related sequences of human DNA on chromosomes 11 and 21 were found to be discontiguous, unlike that of the chicken and avian E26 virus genome, except for a small overlap region. We conclude that the ets sequence shared by the virus, the chicken and man is likely to contain at least two dissociable functional domains, identifiable as ets-1 and ets-2. The human ets-1 locus is transcriptionally active and encodes a single mRNA of 6.8 kb, while the second locus, human ets-2 encodes three mRNAs of 4.7, 3.2 and 2.7 kb. By contrast, the chicken homolog, having a contiguous ets-1 and ets-2 sequence, is primarily expressed in normal chicken cells as a single 7.5 kb mRNA.

The c-myc assay is calibrated using bacterially expressed human c-myc protein. We have used this assay to estimate the number of c-myc molecules in a range of normal and transformed cells of human, murine, and feline origin; to monitor increases in c-myc expression when quiescent cells are stimulated with growth factors; and to follow the decrease in c-myc protein levels when HL60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells are induced to differentiate with dimethylsulphoxide or phorbol esters.","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, MRC Centre, Cambridge, U.K.']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutant frequency at five genetic loci (resistance to ouabain, 6-thioguanine, excess thymidine, methotrexate and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine) was assayed in wild-type cells and trifluorothymidine in TK+/- cells. No significant induced mutation at any locus was observed after 4 h of treatment. Sixteen hours of treatment with high concentrations of sodium fluoride did not induce resistance to ouabain, but resulted in some significant induction of 6-thioguanine, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl cytosine and methotrexate resistance, although the results were variable between experiments and no dose-response was observed. At the thymidine kinase locus, a dose-related increase in mutant frequency to excess thymidine and trifluorothymidine resistance was observed. The maximum induction was approximately eight times the control frequency after TK+/- cells were treated with the highly toxic concentration of 500 micrograms ml-1 of sodium fluoride for 16 h. These observations, and an analysis of the colony size of trifluorothymidine-resistant mutants in TK+/- cells, suggest that sodium fluoride is clastogenic to dividing cultured mammalian cells at high, toxic concentrations. Further work is desirable to investigate the mechanism by which chromosomes are damaged at high concentrations of fluoride, since without such a mechanistic understanding, extrapolation of our data to the human situation must be insecure. Nevertheless, the knowledge available at present gives no reason to expect any genotoxic effects in human tissues at levels of fluoride ions to which they are currently exposed in the general population.","['MRC Cell Mutation Unit, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.']",,"['0 (Mutagens)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)']",['10.1093/mutage/1.2.157 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

M-BCR is part of a gene, BCR, oriented with its 5' end towards the centromere of chromosome 22. All of the CML DNAs analysed have a breakpoint within introns of the BCR gene. As a consequence of the Ph translocation the 3' end of the BCR gene has been translocated to chromosome 9, while the 5' part remains on the Ph chromosome. The remaining BCR sequences act as an acceptor for a chromosome 9 gene, the ABL oncogene: the ABL oncogene is fused in a head-to-tail fashion to the chromosome 22 sequences. This genomic configuration results in the transcription of a novel chimeric mRNA consisting of 5' BCR sequences and 3' ABL oncogene sequences. In K562, a cell line derived from a CML patient, and in five CML patients such chimeric BCR/ABL transcripts have been demonstrated. An abnormally sized ABL protein has been detected in the cell line K562 and in leukaemic cells from patients. This protein represents the translational product of the chimeric mRNA. The role of the BCR part of the fusion protein is unknown; it is possible that the BCR moiety could alter the structure of the ABL protein and unmask its tyrosine kinase activity.

Cytogenetically, it usually results from a t(9;22)(q34;q11). The Ph arises in a stem cell and in chronic phase is found in all haematopoietic cell lineages, although it causes only increased granulopoiesis, and sometimes increased thrombopoiesis; furthermore blast crisis may occur in all differentiative patterns of the pluripotent stem cell. Recently, molecular investigations of Ph positive CML cases have revealed a consistent genomic recombination between two genes, BCR on chromosome 22 and the ABL oncogene. The latter is translocated from 9q34, its normal site, to the 22q- or Ph chromosome. This molecular rearrangement expresses a unique 8.5 kb BCR-ABL hybrid mRNA transcript, that encodes an altered BCR-ABL protein of approximately 210 kD with enhanced in vitro tyrosine kinase activity. The breakpoints on chromosome 22q- are clustered in a 5 kb DNA fragment, allowing their study using Southern blot analysis. Cytogenetic variant forms of the Ph translocation involving three or more chromosomes are found in about 5% of the cases. Southern blot and in situ hybridization studies have demonstrated that these variants are cytogenetically more complex than the standard t(9;22) but molecularly they show the same essential genomic recombination. This is also true for a small number of cases of Ph negative CML. Clonal progression, indicated by the presence of clonal, non-random chromosome abnormalities, in addition to the Ph is rare during chronic phase but is found in 80% of blast crisis. These additional aberrations may precede BC by weeks or months and have therefore a clear prognostic value. Ph is not restricted to CML, since it is also found in ALL (20% of adult cases) and rarely in AML. Ph in acute leukaemia is cytogenetically indistinguishable from Ph in CML, but molecular studies have shown that in 50% of the cases the breakpoint on chromosome 22 is different from the very consistent and characteristic breakpoint in CML. Nevertheless genomic recombination takes place that results in a novel ABL protein at least in some of the cases. Despite extensive cytogenetic and molecular investigations, the mechanisms underlying the formation of the Ph as well as the pathogenesis of Ph positive CML are still unknown but are now the object of intensive research.",,,['0 (DNA Probes)'],['10.1016/s0950-3536(87)80034-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Survival is determined by the timing of disease transformation. The rate of transformation and death is low initially and increases gradually to a stable annual rate, reached during the third year after diagnosis. This averages 25% per year in large populations of Ph positive patients. Transformation appears to occur randomly; a patient's risk of transformation can be defined, but the time when it will occur cannot be predicted. There is no evidence that conventional antileukaemic therapy changes the risk of transformation; thus, survival is determined principally by the intrinsic biology of the disease. A number of features recorded at the time of diagnosis correlate significantly with survival and can serve as prognostic parameters. Multivariate regression and Cox model analyses can generate hazard ratio formulae which provide quantitative estimates of patients' risk. Several Cox models have been described by different groups, and it is possible that two or more models may describe survival equally well. A four-variable model described by the International CGL Prognosis Study Group in 1984 has recently been tested in a prospective study by the Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia, and successfully classified patients into three groups with significantly different outcomes. This model produces excellent results in analyses of large patient populations, but is less satisfactory when applied to smaller series. It is likely that current prognostic models can be improved substantially to provide more accurate definition of patient risk over a broader range of hazard ratio values. Such models should prove useful in evaluating therapeutic schedules, selecting patients for investigational or hazardous treatment and making decisions regarding bone marrow transplantation.",,,,['10.1016/s0950-3536(87)80032-x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Many reports have also detailed the biological effects of these proteins (particularly the viral ABL forms) on a broad range of cell types. However, in spite of all these research efforts, the precise role of the ABL gene in normal and neoplastic growth remains to be determined. To elucidate the mechanism of action of normal and altered ABL proteins, it is imperative to identify their relevant cellular substrates and establish the role of the ABL target proteins in transformation and normal cellular growth. The availability of temperature-sensitive ABL proteins, coupled with the use of sensitive anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, should be useful in this respect. Purification of enzymatically active, intact forms of the ABL proteins produced in insect cells by employing baculovirus expression vectors should permit direct comparison of the biochemical properties and tertiary structures of the various members of the ABL protein kinase family. Such studies will aid in understanding the nature of the alteration of ABL which results in the activation of its transforming potential. Furthermore, the availability of purified ABL proteins should permit examination of interactions of ABL with other growth-regulatory proteins, such as growth factor receptors. It has been shown that transformation-associated ABL proteins interact with the IL-3, IL-2 and GM-CSF growth-factor pathways. These and other components of the cellular signalling pathways are potential ABL targets. The elucidation of ABL function by a variety of approaches such as those described above will ultimately aid in the development of far-reaching therapeutic treatments for at least two forms of human leukaemia: Ph positive CML and Ph positive ALL.",,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(87)80036-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In 111 of these patients who had haematological malignancy and who were prepared for transplant with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation 12-14 Gy, the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis and hepatic veno-occlusive disease was 13% and 3%, respectively. In contrast, the incidence in 15 leukaemic patients prepared for transplant with chemotherapy regimens containing high-dose busulphan was 47% and 20%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Two patients in this latter group who developed fatal veno-occlusive disease had chronic myeloid leukaemia and had received long-term low-dose busulphan pre-transplant. Neither complication occurred in 26 patients prepared by cyclophosphamide alone (20 patients with severe aplastic anaemia) or with cyclophosphamide and melphalan (six patients with leukaemia). The regimen of busulphan 16 mg/kg in combination with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg was associated with a short duration of total leucopenia with a significantly higher leucocyte count on the day of marrow transplant compared to other regimens. Furthermore, oro-pharyngeal mucositis was not severe even when methotrexate was utilised as post-transplant prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease. Thus, while the busulphan-cyclophosphamide regimen appeared useful, we suggest that (1) high-dose busulphan should not be used as a preparative regimen for patients previously exposed to busulphan, and (2) bladder irrigation (as well as intravenous hydration) is necessary to minimise haemorrhagic cystitis in patients given regimens that incorporate high-dose busulphan.","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the applicability of Vim-2 for selective purging, we performed complement-dependent cytotoxicity experiments and determined the specific lysis of AML-CFU. In 11 of 17 patients, 97.5 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD) of AML-CFU were killed following immune-mediated lysis. Multi-lineage normal haematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GEMM) were not significantly affected by the MCA Vim-2-mediated complement lysis.

In vitro treatment of marrow with high doses of mafosfamide (ASTA Z 7557) alters the hematopoietic regenerative capacity of the graft. Thirty-two patients with acute leukemia (12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 20 acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL] with 27 in complete remission and five in partial remission were consolidated with cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2) and total body irradiation (10 Gy), followed by reinfusion of autologous marrow treated in vitro with mafosfamide. The marrow of each patient had been incubated with the highest tolerable dose of mafosfamide, individually predetermined from a preincubation test. We report here that the kinetics of engraftment are strikingly different in ANLL and ALL patients. In the ANLL group recovery to 0.1% reticulocytes took a median of 20.5 days (range 14-32) versus 15 (11-28) in the ALL group; 33.5 days (18-45) versus 19 (15-30) for leukocytes to reach 1.0 x 10(9)/l; 35 (19-60) versus 20.5 (15-30) for neutrophils to reach 0.5 x 10(9)/l; 110+ (45-480+) versus 50 (23-90) for platelets to reach 50 x 10(9)/l (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05). Detection of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) regeneration in marrow aspirates post-ABMT was delayed in ANLL (p less than 0.05). Neither the nature of the previous induction therapy, nor the status of the blood or bone marrow at the time of collection (CFU-GM and erythroid burst-forming units/ml) nor the stem cell sensitivity to mafosfamide, nor the doses of progenitor cells infused could explain these differences. We interpreted these observations as suggesting that the engraftment potential has been more severely altered in ANLL than in ALL, which may reflect both the intensity of the in vitro treatment and the intrinsic fragility of the stem cell pool in ANLL.","[""Unite d'Hematologie, Hopital Rothschild, Paris, France.""]",,"['5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early part of the review we discuss how escalations of dose of chemoradiotherapy might allow ablation of both marrow-derived (leukaemia) and non-marrow-derived disease (lymphoma and solid tumour) provided that haemopoiesis is reintroduced into the host in the form of autologous marrow stem cells, and how cryopreservation techniques have allowed this to proceed. Whilst discussing ABMT in acute leukaemia we describe initial results possibly suggestive of an improvement on current consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy regimens but emphasis that we are dealing only with heterogeneous registry data and not randomised controlled trials. We also suggest that there is no useful data as yet as to the value of purging autologous acute leukaemia marrow. The lymphoma data is described which may suggest a useful role of high dose therapy with ABMT in relapsed disease-timing of ABMT may need to differ profoundly in HD from NHL. Current ABMT data in lymphoma suggests that local relapse at sites of previous disease remain the major problem and emphasises the difficulties of finding satisfactory ablative regimens and timing the selection of patients at particular points in the natural history of their disease. Finally, we emphasise that although solid tumours may numerically represent the largest group of potential candidates for ABMT, the picture in this area remains essentially one of failure to be able to ablate the underlying disease despite increments in chemoradiotherapy and ABMT.","['Department of Haematology, University College Hospital, London.']",,,"['0268-960X(87)90035-X [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(87)90035-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

During the second stage, therapy is administered in an attempt to prolong the duration of remission. The clinical approaches and the problems incurred during these stages are not identical. At the time of diagnosis a decision must be made regarding whether or not the patient is likely to benefit from chemotherapy. If the answer is in the affirmative, then a decision must be made regarding the appropriate chemotherapeutic regimen.

Utilising all of the above markers, it is now clear that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is heterogeneous. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies that identify B cells such as the anti-B1 and anti-B4 antibodies in combination with studies of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement have demonstrated that virtually all cases of non-T-ALL involve B lymphocytes. At least six distinct subgroups of non-T-ALL can now be identified. T-ALL is subdivided by the anti-Leu-9, anti-Leu-1, and additional antibodies that separate T lymphocyte subsets into three primary subgroups.

One feature of this abnormality is a greatly increased sensitivity of the committed erythroid progenitors (BFU-E and CFU-E) to the hormone erythropoietin. Culture in vitro of these bone marrow or peripheral blood cells results in the growth of a proportion of colonies in the absence of added erythropoietin. These endogenous erythroid colonies (EEC) are seen in the great majority of cases of polycythaemia vera, as well as in some cases of thrombocythaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. The presence of EEC appears to be a marker for the stem cell mutation and may serve to distinguish the neoplastic disorders from reactive increases of red cell mass or platelet numbers. Their absence in idiopathic erythrocytosis may also distinguish this condition from early polycythaemia vera and be useful in deciding on appropriate treatment. In patients with even a modest increase in the platelet count endogenous colonies provide firm evidence for a myeloproliferative disorder. Provision of myelosuppressive treatment can avert or improve vaso-occlusive or haemorrhagic complications. The mechanism of erythropoietin hypersensitivity is unknown but it has been shown to be a feature acquired rather late in maturation and by only a proportion of the progeny of the mutated clone.

Pentostatin is an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that is important for purine metabolism, but more than one mechanism may be involved in its cytotoxic action. Early studies with dCF employed large doses and for the most part were conducted in patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia: responses were brief and relatively few, and severe renal, hepatic, and central nervous system toxicity were encountered, leading to temporary abandonment of clinical trials. More recently, it has been shown that dCF is effective in much smaller doses, with considerably less toxicity. It has proved to be more effective in low-grade lymphoid malignancies (chronic leukaemias, indolent lymphomas) than in more undifferentiated neoplasms (acute leukaemias, lymphoblastic and immunoblastic lymphomas), and is outstandingly effective in hairy cell leukaemia, both as initial therapy and after failure of splenectomy and interferon. Pentostatin is profoundly immunosuppressive: generally this is considered a disadvantage but its potential therapeutic exploitation merits investigation.

Haemopoiesis is 'dysplastic' with inefficient maturation of a slowly expanding or sometimes of a stable population, of blood cell precursors. About one third of the patients evolve into acute leukaemia, the result of either a progressive expansion of the original clone or a new mutation producing a more malignant subclone. The majority of patients suffer from the results of bone-marrow insufficiency, with pancytopenia and possibly immune deficiency. Characteristic karyotype anomalies involving mainly chromosomes 5, 7 and 8 are seen in half the patients. These same chromosomes are known to carry different oncogenes. The myelodysplastic syndrome occurs mainly in the aged and there is a moderate male preponderance. The incidence is still unknown but is probably similar to that of acute leukaemia. The etiology is also unknown; however, a secondary myelodysplastic syndrome precedes acute myeloid leukaemia, as a late consequence of chemo- and radio-therapy in treated Hodgkin's disease. This suggests that environmental mutagens might also be involved in primary myelodysplastic syndromes.

With this information, therapy can be tailored for patients at various risks of treatment failure. Using early aggressive therapy, more than 60% of patients are expected to be long-term survivors, but better therapy is still needed for those at high risk of relapse. Innovative approaches, such as bone marrow transplantation, phenotype-specific treatment, or pharmacokinetic-directed therapy, are being tested.","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis.""]","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0268-960X(87)90016-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(87)90016-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

The gene is silent in most tissues but expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, in the late (post-meiotic) stages of spermatogenesis, and in a high proportion of mouse mammary tumor virus-induced carcinomas, when a provirus is inserted upstream or downstream of the coding domain. The functional significance of int-1 in the oncogenic process is supported by the demonstration that murine leukemia virus-based vectors carrying the gene can alter the morphology and growth properties of an established line of mammary epithelial cells. The predicted primary protein product of the int-1 gene is 370 amino acids in length and cysteine-rich; immunoprecipitation with anti-peptide antibodies reveals multiple species of int-1 protein, due to asparagine-linked glycosylations and probable cleavage of a signal peptide.

In four samples an activated N-ras oncogene, and in two samples an activated Ha-ras oncogene were detected in transfectants. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes were used to characterise the mutations in the ras genes. Three samples were found to be mutated to N-ras codon 12 ASP, one to N-ras codon 13 ASP and two to Ha-ras codon 12 VAL. When the corresponding AML DNAs were screened using direct gel hybridisation, the mutant ras genes were detectable in only one case. In two AML samples (82 and 84) with very low percentage blasts (3% and 19%), the absence of mutant ras signal from direct gel hybridisation may be due to the lack of sensitivity of this technique in detecting activated ras in such small fractions of the total DNA. These results illustrate the sensitivity of the in vivo tumour assay in detecting activated ras. When DNA from one of the remaining three AML DNAs was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction method, the mutation present in the transfectant was detected. These findings suggest that even in AMLs with high percentage blasts (40%, 70% and 90%), cells containing mutant ras may comprise only a minor proportion of the major leukaemic clone.","['Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen patients had fever and seven had pruritus and rashes. Lymphadenopathy was found in all 16 cases; generalized in 14 and localized in 2. Hepatomegaly was present in 14 patients while only 7 had splenomegaly. Laboratory findings included autoimmune hemolytic anemia, lymphocytosis and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Pulmonary involvement was seen in 5 cases, and bone marrow showed the characteristic features of the disease in 9 cases. Two patients went on to develop diffuse lymphocytic, poorly differentiated lymphoma. Fourteen patients were treated with prednisolone initially. Five responded with complete recovery, eight responded with partial recovery, and one died with extensive involvement of the disease. Six of the patients that recovered partially were later treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone. One patient recovered completely and two partially. Three died from extensive involvement. Two patients with malignant lymphoma were treated by combination chemotherapy. One case went to complete remission while the other died from infection. One patient was lost to follow up before any treatment was started.","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.']",,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tissue fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in plastic and sectioned at 1 micron was studied using a Zeiss Kontron IBAS 2000 image analysis system. Manual tracing of nuclear outline was performed to obtain the parameters. Both interindividual and intraindividual reproducibilities were evaluated, the former among 8 observers and the latter by the observers repeating the measurements. With the present technique, intraindividual reproducibility was high and correlation was excellent for area, perimeter and form factor measurements. A high degree of interindividual inconsistency was demonstrated for all parameters. Interindividual correlation was poor for form factor. It is concluded that poor interindividual reproducibility even when the objective method of morphometry is used may be a significant problem in tissue investigations, especially when results from different laboratories are being compared.","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong.']",,,['10.3109/00313028709103892 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum-tolerated dose was either 50 mg/kg as a single injection or 20 mg/kg during daily dispensions. Grade 2-4 toxicity, as pulmonary edema and impairment of hepatic function, then occurred during daily treatment. Toxicity was reversible. Mitogen stimulation and mixed lymphocyte culture studies revealed possible immunosuppressive effects of higher doses of ET-18-OCH3. There were no chromosomal changes in cytogenetic studies. Frequent post-mortem examinations revealed no further toxicity. IV and oral treatment showed few encouraging response data since there were two partial remissions in non-small cell lung cancers and a reduction of leukemic blasts to less than 10% in an acute myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Department of Medicine I, Technische Universitaet, Munich, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glyceryl Ethers)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",['10.1007/BF02535566 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

To test the feasibility of such an approach, a murine model and an in vitro human cell model were developed. In the murine system a mixture of normal bone marrow cells and WEHI IIIB myelomonocytic leukemic cells was incubated with varying doses of 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-Me) for 24 hr before being injected into tail veins of lethally irradiated Balb/c mice. At doses of 20 and 100 micrograms/ml, long-term survivors were noted. The additional steps of freezing and thawing following incubation resulted in significantly longer survival with doses of 10 to 50 micrograms/ml, but were toxic to marrow stem cells at 100 micrograms/ml. In the in vitro model, normal marrow progenitor cells and leukemic cells (the promyelocytic cell line HL60) were exposed to varying concentrations of ET-Me for 1 and 4 hr alone or mixed, and clonogenicity was assayed by colony formation in semisolid medium during 7-14 days' incubation. At doses up to 100 micrograms/ml exposed for 4 hr normal progenitor cells were spared and HL60 colonies eliminated. Other phospholipids analogues were less effective in eliminating leukemic cells, but spared normal progenitor cells. A survey of fresh leukemic cells found varying degrees of sensitivity to ET-Me, indicating the need for testing a variety of compounds. These studies clearly indicated the potential usefulness of alkyl lysophospholipid compounds in selectively purging leukemic cells from remission marrows for autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.']",,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",['10.1007/BF02535555 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These agents are therefore mandatory co-factors in the development of myeloid leukemia. The CSFs also modify oncogene transcription, and in model leukemogenesis experiments GM-CSF has been shown to be a proto-oncogene. However, most evidence is against an autocrine hypothesis of myeloid leukemia based solely on CSF production by emerging leukemic cells.

The antagonistic actions of the CSFs on myeloid leukemic cells make it difficult to predict whether they will prove to be useful agents in the management of myeloid leukemias.","['Cancer Research Unit, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']","['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",['10.1007/978-3-642-72624-8_4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these studies have also addressed the controversy concerning the multiplicity in transport routes. It seems clear that erythrocytes and, perhaps, some other mammalian cells possess a single, broadly specific system for transporting nucleosides. However, substantial evidence from valid studies discriminating between transport and intracellular metabolism suggests that at least some mammalian cells, including some tumor cells, possess more than a single system. Evidence now exists for a determining role of membrane transport of nucleoside analogues in their cytotoxicity and, in the case of one pyrimidine nucleoside (AraC), in therapeutic responsiveness in leukemic patients. There are also numerous examples of transport-related resistance to nucleoside analogues. Included in this article are the results of studies from the authors' laboratory pertaining to the therapeutic activity of the purine nucleoside, FAraA, in murine tumor models. These studies provide evidence for a determining role of both membrane transport and intracellular phosphorylation in the selective antitumor action of this agent against murine leukemia. Substantially increased transport inward of FAraA occurs at pharmacologically achievable concentrations of this agent in tumor cells as compared to drug-limiting, normal proliferative epithelium of the small intestine. The basis for this differential appears to be the kinetic duality of FAraA and adenosine transport inward found in tumor cells, but not in proliferative intestinal epithelial cells. Tumor cells have highly saturable (low influx Km) and poorly saturable (high influx Km) systems for adenosine transport, both of which are shared by FAraA. In contrast, proliferative epithelial cells have only a poorly saturable system for these substrates. If a similar kinetic duality of nucleoside transport is found in other tumor cells certain implications arise concerning the significance of the duality to neoplastic transformation.","['Laboratory for Molecular Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, N.Y. 10021.']","['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",['10.1007/BF00047462 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The current concept of the shape of the dose-response curve, particularly at the very low levels, is derived primarily by extrapolation from high doses and is affected by economic, social and political implications of cancer yield. Evidence based on epidemiological studies of populations exposed to fallout, occupational, intrauterine or background LDR is limited, due to methodological drawbacks and the need for extremely large sample sizes. Nevertheless, recent data indicate that LDR-induced childhood leukemia and thyroid cancer may exceed the rates predicted on the basis of the linear quadratic curve. The high yield in utero and in early childhood could be associated with low cumulative load of background radiation, and a consequently more effective radiation increment. A long term follow up of children exposed to 90 mSv after scalp X-irradiation revealed a relative risk of 3.8 and an excess risk of about 1.08 per 1000 man-sievert per year for thyroid cancer. Application of these findings to the post-Chernobyl state of events suggests that an increment of up to 20% in thyroid cancer might occur in a population exposed to 5 mSv as an aftermath of a similar accident.

Besides, substitution of the aminoalkyl side chain in nitracrine by methanesulfon-m-anisidine group suppressed its high antitumor activity, and the presence of a nitro group in position 1 of amsacrine suppressed its antileukemic activity.

Transplantation in relapse resulted in a complete remission rate ranging from 33% to 72%, depending on the time of transplantation, the conditioning regimen used and the performance status of the patient. Remission duration was short, ranging from three to nine months. Transplantation in second or subsequent remission did not change the natural history of the disease. In 14% of the cases, transplantation remissions were obtained exceeding the duration of the preceding remission, results equivalent to those obtained by normal dose chemotherapy. Transplantation in first remission (CR1) resulted in a projected two-year disease-free survival of 72% (13% SE) in acute myelogenous leukemia and of 45% (17% SE) in acute lymphocytic leukemia.

HMBA causes a decrease in diacylglycerol concentration, a decrease in Ca+2 and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C activity (within 2 hr). There is an early (within 1-2 hrs) suppression of c-myb and c-myc gene transcription and an increase in c-fos mRNA (within 4 hrs). During the early or ""latent"" period there is no detectable commitment of MELC to terminal cell division or expression of differentiated genes such as alpha 1 or beta maj globin genes. HMBA-induced commitment to terminal differentiation is detected by 12 hrs and over 95% become committed cells by 48-60 hrs. Commitment is associated with persistent suppression of c-myb gene transcription and elevated levels of c-fos mRNA, whereas the level of c-myc mRNA returns to that of uninduced cells. By 36-48 hrs, transcription of the alpha 1 and beta maj globin genes increases 10-30 fold, and that of rRNA genes is suppressed. Changes in expression of c-myb, c-myc, c-fos and p53 genes that occur early during HMBA-induced differentiation may be important in the multistep process involved in commitment of MEL cells to terminal differentiation. Continued suppression of c-myb gene expression may be required for terminal differentiation of these cells.","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratories, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']","['AM-37513/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb36252.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The genes involved in most solid tumors, and the mechanisms giving rise to their activation, are virtually unknown. In contrast, for hematopoietic malignancies, we have identified several genes important in oncogenesis, and we understand in at least a limited sense the mechanisms by which translocations impart these genes with the capacity to support malignant growth. It is becoming increasingly apparent that these mechanisms involve very subtle changes in the pattern of gene expression. Similarly, the studies on the mechanisms of chromosome translocation described here underscore the proposition that malignancy may arise by slight perturbations of normal function. The enzymes that physiologically recombine Ig and TCR genes do so with high fidelity under normal circumstances. But occasionally misrecognition of target sequences may lead to chromosome translocation and neoplasia. A deeper understanding of this process will be facilitated by a more certain grasp of normal B- and T-lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation.","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']","['CA 25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb36248.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These results were obtained in spite of a high rate of deaths in complete remission during the initial year of the study. Subsequently, probably as a result of improved expertise in the handling of the protocol, the proportion of toxic deaths declined sharply.

There was a significant difference in the antibiotic resistance of strains derived from patients with urinary-tract infections (UTI) and with leukaemia (LP). As compared to the UTI group, among E. coli strains in the LP group the frequency of multiple resistance was significantly higher, the MIC values were higher and R-plasmids were more frequent. Out of 30 multiple resistant E. coli strains 27 were R-plasmid carriers. Three different kinds of plasmid profile were shown in more than one strain (2 out of 10 UTI strains and 3 and 2 out of 10 LP strains).

High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis permits the identification of a wide array of activated ras alleles encoding proteins with single amino acid substitutions at any of several positions. The products of three ras genes, H-ras, N-ras, and K-ras, were detected in each of 33 specimens of fresh leukemic cells. The normal K-ras and N-ras polypeptides were substantially more abundant than H-ras p21 in all samples. In over three-fourths of the cases the total amount of p21ras exceeded that seen in control hematopoietic cell lines. The level of ras expression did not correlate simply with clinical parameters, although the two samples with the most abundant p21ras were obtained from patients with relapsed T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Abnormal p21ras, consistent with oncogenic activation, was found in eight patients. Six of 11 samples from acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) patients displayed a mutant N-ras p21, while only one of 20 ALL specimens had abnormal N-ras, and one had a mutant H-ras. In every case the mutant protein comprised a minority of total p21ras. In two T-cell ALL cell lines both normal and activated N-ras gene products were expressed at equal levels. By contrast, in five fresh AML samples the abnormal N-ras protein was several-fold less abundant than the normal N-ras p21. This finding implies that only a proportion of leukemic cells in an individual patient may carry the mutant ras oncogene.","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these events are temporarily related, it remains unclear how activation of this protein kinase leads to changes in nuclear transcription. In this study, we find that bryostatin, a macrocyclic lactone which does not induce differentiation of HL-60 cells but activates PK-C, mimics the effects of phorbol esters on protein phosphorylation and PK-C location. Treatment of HL-60 cells with bryostatin stimulates phosphorylation of the surface transferrin receptor and in the cytoplasm of five proteins having the molecular weights of 17-43 kDa over the same time course as that stimulated by phorbol esters. Similarly, prolonged treatment with bryostatin, like that with phorbol esters, causes the loss of all cellular PK-C activity. Unlike the phosphorylation studies, bryostatin treatment, over a 1-100 nM concentration range and for varying lengths of time, did not affect HL-60 c-myc RNA levels, while phorbol ester treatment rapidly decreased c-myc RNA levels. These data suggest that neither the activation of PK-C and the phosphorylation of specific substrates nor the loss of total cellular PK-C activity from HL-60 cells is sufficient to induce marked decreases in c-myc levels and differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['University of Alabama, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Birmingham 35294.']","['AM 27157/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-six patients had lymphoproliferative lesions, the main feature being a densely cellular population of small lymphocytes. This group was further divided into reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and atypical lymphoid hyperplasia. Symptoms and signs were similar within the subgroups. The mean length of follow-up was 3.7 years. Of the 26 patients 14 had extraorbital lymphoproliferative disease, 9 had orbital recurrences and 2 died of widespread disease. Twelve patients had inflammatory lesions with distinctly different histologic features from those of the lymphoproliferative group. Symptoms and signs were similar to those in the latter group. The mean length of follow-up was 2.1 years. Four of the 12 had orbital recurrences; none had extraorbital disease or died of their disease. We feel that orbital lymphoproliferative lesions can easily be separated from clinically similar low-grade inflammatory lesions histologically and that they should be staged and followed like small lymphocytic lymphomas.

The combination of methotrexate and cyclosporin is significantly better than either alone in controlling GVHD. Removal of T cells from donor marrow prior to BMT has also decreased GVHD significantly, but a 5-10% rejection rate occurs and an increased relapse risk is being reported by some centres. Cyclosporin is valuable in the treatment of both acute and chronic GVHD. Interstitial pneumonitis due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of mortality. Protection can be provided with CMV hyperimmune globulin and also by the avoidance of blood donors who are CMV antibody positive. Fractionated total body irradiation is associated with decreased toxicity compared to single dose. There is a 75% 4 year disease-free survival following BMT for acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission, a 50% survival for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second remission and an 88% survival for chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.

One hundred and twenty two patients received transplants for aplastic anemia; engraftment was reported in 4 patients; graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) did not occur. Complete and partial responses were reported in one-half of patients, the majority of whom had no evidence of engraftment. Thirty-nine patients received transplants for leukemia. Transient engraftment was reported in 40% and two developed GvHD; survival extended to more than 2 years. The higher rate of engraftment in patients with leukemia suggests a role of pretransplant immune suppression. The risk of GvHD appears to be low despite complete HLA-mismatching. These data suggest a possible role for fetal liver transplantation in man. Future studies should probably be based on preclinical data obtained in large animal models.","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['CA 23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['0 (HLA Antigens)'],['10.1007/978-94-009-3365-1_9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

One and a half years to nine years after treatment 13 patients (46%) survive in the transplant group and 53 patients (74%) survive in the second group. All except one in the second group have self-sustaining hematopoiesis without need for transfusions. There is one major difference between the two therapies. Marrow transplantation restores bone marrow function completely and no late hematological complications have been seen in this group. The majority of patients treated with antilymphocyte globulin in contrast have residual abnormalities of hemopoiesis: macrocytosis, mild granulocytopenia and mild thrombocytopenia. Relapse (11 of 72 patients) and clonal hematological disorders, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (4 patients) and leukemia (one patient) can occur years after complete bone marrow reconstitution with antilymphocyte globulin. These late disorders are of concern. In spite of this we conclude that antilymphocyte globulin treatment is an effective therapy with low early mortality and morbidity and a high chance for a long sustained remission. Results are better or at least equivalent to bone marrow transplantation and patients with donors should be given the option of transplantation or antilymphocyte globulin.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital, University of Basel, Switzerland.']",,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",['10.1007/978-94-009-3365-1_17 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

No special effort was made to transfuse HLA- matched or partially matched donor cells into the recipient. The recipients were HLA typed at varying time intervals following FLI in an attempt to document a possible chimerism.

This intracellular marker was also investigated by cytoimmunofluorescent tests in 17 other cases of initial leukemias and in 3 diagnosed lymphoblastic lymphomas. Generally, the TdT levels were significantly enhanced in the blasts of the following: acute undifferentiated leukemias; the more immature types of acute lymphoblastic leukemias i.e., the null, non-T non-B, common, early T and pre-B subgroups; a fraction of blastic crises in chronic myelogenous leukemias; and many lymphoblastic lymphomas. TdT might also be slightly increased in the mononucleate blood cells obtained from the most immature forms of acute myelogenous leukemias. Relapses with changes in cell phenotypes were occasionally observed in previously TdT-positive leukemias as a result of clonal evolution of the disease. The leukemias with blasts containing high levels of TdT were usually responsive to treatment with corticosteroids and vincristine. TdT is an oligoclonal marker characterizing several populations of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated blasts that tend to develop towards or along the lymphoid pathway. Together with specific immunological markers, this enzyme is useful to define the particular type of leukemic cells.

The test was well tolerated and showed a profound fall in B12 absorption, which was maximal at two weeks after transplantation and recovered by eight weeks. The predominant influence on absorption at this stage was probably the conditioning schedule, and the presence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was not associated with a further impairment of absorption. Six patients with chronic GVHD were studied. When compared with nine patients without GVHD there was a significant (p less than 0.005) reduction of B12 absorption.

Radiotherapy alone achieves this cure rate only in unilateral high cervical or inguinal stage 1 presentations. With all other presentations, radiotherapy requires the addition of chemotherapy to sustain the 90 per cent cure level. Combined modality regimens offer the patient the advantage of reduced doses of each modality in terms of number of Gy and courses of chemotherapy. The contribution of the staging laparotomy to combination therapy is now being questioned. This issue becomes pressing as imaging of the lymphatic system and commonly involved extranodal sites of disease is improved by computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound technology. Only the spleen escapes adequate examination. The failure of imaging techniques to adequately determine the status of the spleen is compensated by the chemotherapy sensitivity of splenic disease, as often demonstrated in the treatment of patients with stage IV disease. Staging laparotomy for preadolescent children should be done on special indications, because splenectomy confers a life-long (50 years or more) threat of overwhelming infection despite administration of pneumococcal vaccine and the use of oral penicillin prophylaxis. The use of radiotherapy in a dose range that inhibits bone and dental development in immature, preadolescent children can no longer be condoned. Treatment with chemotherapy alone must be considered as the option for preadolescent and younger adolescent children. Radiotherapy in a low dose range (2000 to 2200 cGy) in combination with chemotherapy constitutes a possible alternative treatment. In combined therapy regimens, it appears unnecessary to deliver six full courses of chemotherapy because regimens using three or four courses have demonstrated effectiveness in adults with early stage disease. The selection of the chemotherapy regimen should be made with care so as to eliminate drugs causing sterility in the young male, ovarian dysfunction in females, and second malignant tumors including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, doxorubicin should be used only in noncardiotoxic cumulative doses. Pretreatment determinations of the cardiac ejection fraction provide some assurance of safety during doxorubicin therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Department of Pediatrics, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston, Texas.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this patient group were compared to those of 32 patients aged 30-39 years (median 33.5 years) with AL or CML, who also underwent BMT during the same period of time. The overall actuarial survival of the two age groups was comparable with 44% and 41% at 5.9 and 5.6 years, respectively. Patients with standard risk criteria (i.e. HLA-genotypically identical sibling donor, 1st chronic phase of CML or 1st remission of AL) showed a higher probability of survival in both groups (62% at 5.9 years in older patients and 59% at 5.5 years in younger patients, respectively). In contrast, actuarial survival in patients who underwent BMT at an advanced stage of their disease or with marrow from a partially HLA-compatible donor was significantly inferior (P = 0.04). The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was low in older patients (27%), who received marrow from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The most frequent cause of death was interstitial pneumonia, occurring in seven of the older patients (35%) and in seven of the younger patients (22%). This difference, however, was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that allogenic marrow transplantation in the fifth decade of life might be associated with a tolerable risk of transplantation-related complications. This treatment modality may therefore be regarded as first-line therapy for patients in 1st remission of AL or first chronic phase of CML, who show a normal performance status. The same applies to older patients in advanced stages of disease, since the results are comparable to those achieved in the younger patient group.","['Department of Internal Medicine (Tumour Research), West German Tumour Centre, University Hospital Essen, F.R.G.']",,,['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90447-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Special problems are associated with treating patients in this age group. The leukaemias may be intrinsically different, in part because of the high incidence of preceding myelodysplasia. There is increased likelihood of coincident disease. There is lower tolerance to toxic complications, such as infection and bleeding, associated with a decreased resilience of normal haematopoiesis. There is more difficulty in obtaining intravenous access in elderly patients. These problems render patients ineligible for marrow transplants. Myelodysplastic syndromes occur predominantly in the elderly. There are a number of myelodysplastic syndromes now identified, each with its characteristic natural history. Management decisions are based on accurate diagnosis of the specific syndrome, consideration of prognostic features, a period of observation, and conservative treatment principles. More than half the cases of acute myeloblastic leukaemia also occur in the elderly. Prognostic factors must be examined and the literature carefully scrutinized for results pertinent to the elderly patient. In some patients treatment may be justifiably withheld, others may benefit from low dose cytosine arabinoside and some patients should receive aggressive combination chemotherapy. Management of the chronic leukaemias in the elderly is a less controversial area. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common of the leukaemias in this age group. Prognostic factors can be determined using staging criteria. observation alone is indicated in many patients. Chlorambucil and prednisone are the most widely used drugs for symptomatic disease. Aggressive combination chemotherapy may benefit a few patients with advanced or refractory CLL. Hairy cell leukaemia is a rare disorder but many of the patients are over age 65. The elderly male patient may have a particularly benign course and require no therapy. Splenectomy is the standard first line of therapy, but recombinant alpha-interferon is sufficiently effective and non-toxic that it should be the treatment of choice in some patients. Deoxycoformycin is also effective in preliminary trials and may soon be routinely indicated. It is not often appreciated that half of all patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia are aged 65 and over.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,['10.1016/s0950-3536(87)80008-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

All had undergone bone marrow transplantation prepared with cyclophosphamide and single fraction total body irradiation (900-1000 cGy) between 1.5 and 3.8 (mean 2.2) years previously. The majority of children exhibited growth failure, which was of multiple aetiology. Ten patients, of whom eight had had previous prophylactic cranial irradiation, had evidence of growth hormone deficiency based on the reduced growth hormone response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia. Three patients had evidence of hypothalamic damage as shown by their growth hormone response to 200 micrograms GHRH (1-29) NH2 intravenously. Gonadal failure was common, assessed clinically, and biochemically by basal gonadotrophin and sex steroid concentrations. All four girls of adolescent age (10.6-14.1 years) had ovarian failure requiring sex steroid replacement. Of the eight boys of adolescent age (12.3-18.3 years), two had testicular failure requiring sex steroid supplements. Both of these had had previous testicular irradiation. Five others had compensated gonadal failure, and one had normal Leydig cell function. Abnormalities of the TSH response to TRH occurred in 10 patients but only three had overt hypothyroidism.

Risk factors are imprecisely defined and controversial. We analysed data from 2036 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants for leukaemia or aplastic anaemia to identify risk factors for GvHD. Analyses indicate that grading of GvHD can be reproducibly divided into absent or mild versus moderate to severe; 2-year actuarial probability was 54% (95% confidence interval 52-56%) for absent or mild and 46% (44-48%) for moderate to severe. Factors predictive of development of moderate to severe GvHD include donor/recipient sex-match (female----male greater than others, relative risk 2.0, P less than 0.001). This risk was markedly increased if female donors for male recipients were previously pregnant or transfused (relative risk 2.9, P less than 0.0001). Older patients were at increased risk of GvHD (relative risk 1.6, P less than 0.001), but the age gradient was modest, even the youngest patients had a substantial risk of GvHD and, if parous or transfused female----male transplants were excluded, age was not a significant risk factor. Cyclosporine or methotrexate were equally effective at preventing GvHD and were superior to no prophylaxis (relative risk 2.3, P less than 0.01). These data should be useful in estimating the risk of acute GvHD in an individual patient and in designing clinical trials to investigate methods to modify or prevent GvHD.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA Center for the Health Sciences.']","['AM33752/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-62530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06160.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-seven tumors expressed monotypic immunoglobulin, one or more B-lineage antigens, and Ia (HLA-DR) antigen. Proliferation centers expressed the T9 antigen and increased numbers of Ki-67-positive cells. One tumor was of T-cell origin, had a cytotoxic/suppressor cell phenotype, and showed anomalous loss of Leu-1 antigen. Immunophenotypic findings were correlated to the clinical presentation and morphologic features of each neoplasm. Sixteen tumors were associated with peripheral lymphocytosis (greater than 4000/cu mm), 13 biopsies were obtained from extranodal sites, 16 tumors had proliferation centers, and 11 neoplasms had plasmacytoid features. The authors found no absolute and few statistically significant immunologic differences between the B-cell tumors according to their clinical presentation or morphologic features. Tumors associated with peripheral lymphocytosis more commonly expressed the Leu-1 antigen (P less than 0.01) and IgD (P less than 0.01) and less frequently were stained by BA-2 (P less than 0.05) and OKT9 (P less than 0.05). Plasmacytoid neoplasms more frequently expressed the Tac (P less than 0.01) and T9 antigens (P less than 0.05), and all expressed kappa light chain (P less than 0.05). Extranodal neoplasms more commonly expressed IgM (P less than 0.01). In contrast to the markedly different clinical presentation and morphologic appearance these tumors may have, the immunologic data suggest that B-cell small lymphocytic neoplasms are relatively homogeneous. For an individual case, immunophenotype does not predict clinical presentation or morphologic features.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305.']","['CA-33119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,PMC1899809,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemical studies could be performed on either cell suspensions or smears. The method using cell suspensions was more sensitive, producing less background staining, but requiring more cells than that using smears. Among the five methods examined, indirect immunoperoxidase (IP) and indirect immunoalkaline phosphatase (IAP) were comparable in sensitivity. The peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP), alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) and avidin-biotin complex-immunoalkaline phosphatase (ABC-AP) methods were comparable in sensitivity and were more sensitive than either the IP or IAP technique. The peroxidase methods were plagued with problems related to endogenous enzyme activity and the ABC-AP method may exhibit undesirable background staining. Therefore, the IAP method should be used for cell suspensions and the APAAP for cells on smears. In CSF specimens with a small number of cells, immunocytochemical studies should be done on smears by the APAAP method. These conclusions are supported by our experience with CSF specimens from patients with reactive and neoplastic lymphocytoses.","['Special Hematology Laboratory, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Louisville, KY 40202.']",,['0 (Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of all patients with histologically proven VOD revealed a consistent clinical syndrome of liver dysfunction occurring within the first 3 weeks after marrow infusion. This was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia peaking at greater than or equal to 2 mg/dl with at least 2 of 3 other findings: hepatomegaly, ascites, and 5% or greater weight gain. VOD developed in 22% (52 of 235). A persistently elevated aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) prior to transplant was associated with an increased risk of developing VOD by multivariate analysis (P = 0.0003), and acute leukemia in first remission was associated with a decreased risk (P = 0.02). Neither the preparative regimen (busulfan and cyclophosphamide versus cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation) nor the type of graft (allogeneic versus autologous) influenced the occurrence. Twenty-four of these 52 patients (47%) died with VOD (10% of the entire group).

As better ways of preventing GVHD are found, the morbidity and mortality of allogeneic BMT should be reduced and the benefits of transplantation for curing patients with ANLL should be increased.

The initial genetic lesions that inhibit differentiation and increase the likelihood of self renewal have yet to be identified. Given the heterogeneity of this neoplasm, it is possible that many different mutational events may be capable of triggering leukemia. Alternatively, there may be only a small number of possible initial leukemic mutations, and the heterogeneous phenotype of the disease is determined by the evolution of different subclones that have acquired different secondary mutations. Studies with retroviral oncogenes have suggested that a common secondary event in an evolving myeloid tumor is the development of growth factor independence by either leukemic cell production of CSF or possibly constitutive activation of a CSF receptor. These mechanisms have not yet been established as important in human AML, although there is intriguing evidence to suggest that CSF genes are inappropriately activated in many cases.","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']","['CA19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of translocations in Burkitt's lymphoma cells have shown that the c-myc proto-oncogene is consistently juxtaposed with a rearranged and transcriptionally active immunoglobulin gene locus, with resultant myc gene deregulation. In other B cell tumors, translocations appear to bring previously unrecognized oncogenes (bcl-1, bcl-2) into similar association with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. T cell receptor genes may also ""activate"" known and unknown oncogenes after chromosome translocation. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the translocated c-abl oncogene forms a ""hybrid"" gene in its new location on the Philadelphia chromosome, with altered function. Gene amplification units, seen as cytogenetically homogeneous staining regions in chromosomes or as double-minute bodies in metaphases, can represent multiple copies of oncogenes and be important in late stages of tumor progression. Other significant alterations in gene dosage, recognized as gain or loss of all or part of a specific chromosome, also occur in human neoplasms, but their specific role in carcinogenesis is largely undefined.","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, certain groups of subjects, including neonates, cancer patients, organ and bone marrow transplant recipients and those with congenital or acquired deficiencies of cell mediated immunity, are at increased risk for dissemination of either virus to the lungs and/or other viscera. The highest risk for VZV pneumonitis is in bone marrow transplant recipients, 44%, and in children with acute leukemia, 32%. The mortality from this complication of VZV infection in the preantiviral era was at least 25%. Except for neonates, dissemination and mortality rates for HSV infections are less than for VZV infections in the high risk groups. Cell-mediated immunity has a major role in both recovery from primary infection and modulation of latent infection, but antiherpes antibodies also have an important role in moderating the extent and severity of infection. Both viruses cause a patchy nodular pneumonia with scattered necrotic and hemorrhagic foci. Physical examination is often misleading and rapid progression of pneumonia can occur within hours. Intravenous acyclovir, administered early in the course of HSV and VZV infection at dosages of 250 mg/m2 and 500 mg/m2 every eight hours, respectively, has nearly eliminated the risk of severe symptomatic pneumonitis. Treatment of established pneumonitis with acyclovir at these doses has also reduced the mortality of herpesvirus pneumonias.","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a protein with a C-terminal domain related to the src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (EC 2.7.1.112) and, among these, has most significant homology to the lck gene isolated from a murine leukemia virus-induced thymoma cell line. The gene is therefore referred to as c-tkl for cellular tyrosine kinase related to lck. Analysis of genomic DNA reveals that c-tkl is a chromosomal locus distinct from c-src and c-lck. Furthermore, the size of c-tkl mRNA as well as its pattern of expression indicates that it is not the chicken homologue of lck but a different gene. A 3.8-kb transcript of the c-tkl gene, identical to the size determined for c-src mRNA, was observed in cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts and in chicken spleen and brain. In contrast, detection of a definite c-src mRNA signal with mRNA from spleen was not possible under the hybridization conditions employed when the 5' end of v-src was used as the probe, and none of the 11 clones obtained from the cDNA library corresponded to a c-src transcript. Thus previous studies of c-src mRNA expression in spleen may have actually detected c-tkl transcripts.","['Chemotherapeutisches Forschungsinstitut, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany.']","['CA 01058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",['10.1073/pnas.84.24.8778 [doi]'],,,,PMC299633,['GENBANK/J03579'],,,,,,

HEL cells, that normally grow in suspension, attached rapidly on pFn-coated growth substratum and some cells showed spreading. Upon exposure to TPA most of the cells adhered and showed some degree of spreading also when plated on plastic. The spread cells showed mostly peripheral accumulations of F-actin in addition to actin fibers seen in some of the cells. When the cells were plated in the presence of TPA on pFn or on pFn-fragments, containing the cell binding site, all the cells adhered rapidly, spread extensively, organized prominent F-actin stress fibers and typical ventral plaques of vinculin and alpha-actinin. Both proteins were revealed also in the suspended cells by Western blot analysis. When plated on substratum coated with other pFn-fragments or laminin, the HEL cells did not adhere or spread. Both adhesion on pFn as well as formation of stress fibers in the presence of TPA could be prevented by the synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS). HEL cells were also able to organize typical ventral fibrillar arrays of Fn. Immunostaining and metabolic labeling experiments showed that the cells did not contain or synthesize Fn, indicating that the plaques were formed from exogenous pFn by the cells. The results suggest that Fn and TPA synergistically induce the organization of the actomyosin system in HEL cells by promoting the formation of prominent actin stress fibers and focal adhesion sites.","['Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The BMT recipients were followed up for a period of 4-65 months. All patients were given cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation and methotrexate in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Eleven of 22 patients exhibited chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) (extensive in five, limited in six at the time of the study) assessed by clinical and histological parameters. Serum samples were collected from these patients, before BMT (except in one case) and then every 2 or 3 months. Sequential studies to determine the presence of autoantibodies against cytoskeletal proteins (actin, tubulin, myosin), dsDNA and dDNA in these sera were performed by an ELISA method. Simultaneously, immunoelectrophoresis and measurement of complement fractions C3, C4 were performed on each sample. High levels of autoantibodies against cytoskeletal proteins were found in 10/11 patients with cGvHD and were absent in 11/11 patients without cGvHD; none of them exhibited anti-DNA activity. At the same time, C4 levels were decreased in seven of these patients with cGvHD. Monoclonal immunoglobulins IgG and IgM (2-15 g/l) were found in 8/11, but the antibody activity was never found to be located within the M component. These results show a direct relationship between the presence of these autoantibodies and occurrence of cGvHD and indicate that they may constitute an immunological marker related to this complication. However, their predictive value is not clearly evident in this retrospective series as in some patients they preceded clinical signs of cGvHD, whereas in others they were associated with the onset of cGvHD.","[""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Immunohematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Paris, France.""]",,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb02351.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients with these complications were identified among the 400 patients with acute leukemia seen during this time period. Signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen were present despite immunosuppression. The incidence of sepsis at the time of presentation was 53%. Preoperative risk factors identified most frequently were coagulopathy and organ failure resulting from sepsis. Postoperative morbidity (25%) and mortality rates (8%) were related to the development of infectious complications. Appendicitis occurred in eight of the 15 patients studied, whereas typhlitis or its complications was found in seven patients. No preoperative factors could be found to differentiate typhlitis from appendicitis on clinical examination. It is suggested that operation can be safely performed in neutropenic patients who have acute right lower quadrant pain and signs of peritoneal irritation and may be the only effective way of differentiating appendicitis from typhlitis.","['Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20205.']",,,['10.1097/00000658-198712000-00005 [doi]'],,,,PMC1493312,,,,,,,

Rats were implanted with diffuse and focal hepatic lymphoma. Both in vitro measurements of relaxation times and in vivo MR imaging of normal liver and of diffuse and focal hepatic lymphoma were compared. Diffuse infiltrative hepatic lymphoma showed increased T1 (45%) and T2 (41%) relaxation times in vitro, but could not be distinguished from normal control livers on in vivo spin echo (SE) images with a repetition time of 500 msec and an echo time of 30 msec (SE 500/30) or SE 1500/60 images. Focal hepatic lymphoma showed increased T1 (185%) and T2 (115%) relaxation times relative to normal liver tissue. Focal hepatic lymphoma was undetectable on unenhanced SE 500/30 MR images (contrast-to-noise ratio, C/N = 0.4) and was slightly hyperintense on SE 1500/60 images (C/N = 1.1). Ferrite (50 mumol Fe/kg) was administered to improve tissue contrast. In normal control animals, T2 of liver in vitro decreased from 29.3 +/- 3.3 msec to 11.1 +/- 1.2 msec, and image signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of liver in vivo decreased from 16.1 +/- 2.4 to 2.8 +/- 0.3 (p less than .005). Ferrite-enhanced diffuse hepatic lymphoma showed in vitro T2 values and in vivo MR image S/N values indistinguishable from those of normal control animals. The T2 of focal hepatic lymphoma was essentially unaltered by ferrite. On SE 500/30 images, focal hepatic lymphoma became readily detectable, quantitated by a 35-fold increase in tumor-liver C/N.

The more characterized of these are the oncogenes, whose activation appears to play a major role in human neoplasia. There are now two families of oncogenes, the myc and ras families, whose cooperation seems capable of transforming normal cells in culture to tumorigenic cells. As such, they appear to form complementation groups with immortalizing and transforming properties, respectively. Moreover, the oncogenes can be subclassified as tyrosine kinases or kinase related, GTP binding proteins, growth factors or growth factor receptors or nuclear proteins. More than 20 viral oncogenes have been identified, for which more than 30 proto-oncogenes or pseudogenes exist in the human genome. Many of these have been cloned, characterized to some extent, and mapped to particular chromosomes or regions of chromosomes. Further, more than 20 additional putative oncogenes or transforming genes have been identified by tumor DNA transfection studies or at sites of integration or translocation for which no viral transforming gene cognates exist. Oncogenes can be activated by increased or unregulated expression, increased copy number (duplication, amplification), or somatic mutation resulting in a protein with increased oncogenic potential. Examples of all of these mechanisms can be found in several specific human cancers or leukemias. The cytogenetic correlate of enhanced expression is a translocation between two chromosomes at specific breakpoints with no net loss of genetic material (e.g., increased c-myc expression resulting from the 8;14 translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma). The phenomenon of increased gene copy number can sometimes be visualized as trisomy or tetrasomy for a particular chromosome but more dramatically as the development of extrachromosomal DMs or as chromosomally integrated HSRs (e.g., the N-myc gene amplification seen in neuroblastoma). Finally, certain somatic mutations can be associated with translocations (e.g., the bcr/abl fusion product created as a result of the 9;22 translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia), but they are more commonly submicroscopic (as characterized by point mutations in the ras gene family). Evidence is accumulating for a second class of cancer-related genes whose absence or inactivation is associated with tumorigenesis. These genes are associated at the cytogenetic level with chromosomal deletions, in which the breakpoints may be variable, but specific, common regions are consistently deleted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Edward Mallinckrodt Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.']","['KO4-CA01027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA399771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The larger type of p53 mRNA was found associated with polysomes, suggesting that it is translatable in cells. The difference in size between the noninduced and the differentiation-specific type of p53 mRNAs (about 200 nucleotides) was not abrogated following the deadenylation of the mRNAs, thus excluding the possibility that the altered size might result from a longer poly(A) tract. S1 nuclease mapping of the 3' termini of the p53 mRNAs revealed that the 3' ends of both p53 mRNA types were identical, suggesting that either alternative splicing or a longer 5' noncoding region could cause this heterogeneity in p53 mRNA transcripts.","['Department of Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']","['0042-6822(87)90159-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0042-6822(87)90159-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Data on 2 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, grafted earlier in December 1968 and April 1971, are also included. These children received an allogeneic bone marrow graft for leukemia (n = 7), severe aplastic anemia (n = 11), or severe combined immunodeficiency (n = 4) and were informative for this study, because they differed from their donor by sex (n = 16) and/or by immunoglobulin phenotype (n = 13). Of 16 pairs in which the donor was of the opposite sex, 11 patients ultimately showed circulating T and B lymphocytes of donor origin after bone marrow transplantation; in the remaining 5, there was an incomplete chimerism of the circulating lymphoid cells. Of 13 pairs with a difference in immunoglobulin phenotype between donor and recipient, 8 patients exhibited donor allotypes 3 months or later after transplantation, in 3 of them together with recipient allotypes. In the remaining 5 patients, recipient allotypes were detected after transplantation, but the simultaneous presence of donor-type immunoglobulin production could not be excluded in 4. The persistence of either a split (T lineage of donor origin and B lineage of recipient origin) or mixed (T and/or B lineage of donor and recipient origin) chimerism was related to the type of disease. In 3 children circulating B cells of donor-origin did not fit with the recipient origin of the sessile immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. This implies that different immune compartments--e.g., bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissues--should be investigated following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. A prolonged presence of recipient-type lymphoid cells increased the risk of leukemic relapse in the patients investigated.","['Central Laboratory, Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Leiden.']",,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],['10.1097/00007890-198711000-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Follow-up after cytogenetic study ranged from 24 to 70 months. Seventeen patients had stage 0, 10 had stage I, 31 had stage II, and 44 had stage III or IV. Adequate metaphases were obtained for karyotypic analysis in 86 (84%) of 102 patients. Of these 86 patients with adequate metaphases, 43 had normal karyotypes (50%) and 43 had abnormal karyotypes (50%), of which trisomy 12 was the most frequent. Ten patients had trisomy 12 as the sole abnormality, 14 had trisomy 12 in combination with other abnormalities, and the remaining 19 had other abnormalities without trisomy 12. Abnormal karyotypes were more frequently associated with patients with advanced stages than those with early stages of the disease. Response rate to chemotherapy was significantly higher in patients with normal karyotypes than in those with abnormal karyotypes. Of eight patients who subsequently developed Richter's syndrome, seven initially had complex karyotypic changes with or without trisomy 12. These observations suggest that the chances of development of Richter's syndrome in CLL patients with multiple chromosome changes may be much higher than in those with either simple trisomy 12 or a normal karyotype. Mean frequency of abnormal metaphases was significantly higher in patients with complex trisomy 12 in combination with other changes than in those with trisomy 12 as the sole abnormality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Medical Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",,,['0037-1963(87)90005-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A model system with myeloid blood cells has shown that (i) normal blood cells require different proteins to induce cell multiplication (growth inducers) and cell differentiation (differentiation inducers), (ii) there is a hierarchy of growth inducers as cells become more restricted in their developmental program, and (iii) a cascade of interactions between proteins determines the correct balance between immature and mature cells in normal blood cell development. Gene cloning has shown that there is a family of different genes for these proteins. Normal protein regulators of blood cell development can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation to mature nondividing cells.

The most frequent cause of death in patients in early remission (ALL in second or third remission or AML in first or second remission) was bacterial sepsis, fungal sepsis, or both, most often in the presence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Among patients with ALL who received transplants while in second remission, the duration of the initial remission had no effect on the probability of relapse after transplantation. The only pretransplantation factor that significantly affected outcome was the disease status at the time of transplantation; patients in early remission had better disease-free survival.

We report here two patients who received HLA-identical sibling bone-marrow transplants for acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia during their first remission. Both developed category-A AIDS at days 342 and 546 after transplantation, respectively. Neither patient belonged to any known high-risk group for AIDS, other than having received a blood-product transfusion. One of the two patients is now known to have received blood from a donor who was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive. Both patients developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and other opportunistic infections, and both have died of AIDS without evidence of recurrence of their leukaemia. One patient had no chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the other had mild chronic GVHD of the mouth. Since severe opportunistic infections are rare after transplantation in the absence of GVHD, their late occurrence after transplantation should raise the suspicion of AIDS. This complication is likely to have an adverse impact on the long-term survival of patients who received bone-marrow transplants between 1981 and the introduction of effective screening tests for HIV infection in blood donors.","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The receptors for a number of growth factors have intracellular domains with tyrosine protein kinase activity and several viral oncogenes code for tyrosine protein kinases. An abnormal tyrosine protein kinase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic granulocytic leukemia. Using an immunoblot method and an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, we have detected substrates of tyrosine protein kinases in fresh human leukemia cells and normal blood and bone marrow cells. These substrates were present in all types of cells examined. Cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia contain prominent phosphotyrosine-containing protein bands with molecular weights in excess of 95 kDa. By contrast, chronic granulocytic leukemia cells, as well as normal bone marrow cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes, contain predominantly low molecular weight (less than 95 kDa) tyrosine kinase substrates. When lymphocytes were stimulated to enter cell cycle, however, high molecular weight substrates of similar molecular weights to those detected in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia became prominent.

Administration of HDMTX results in tumoricidal plasma concentrations of the drug without significant host toxicity, provided that plasma MTX levels are monitored and LV rescue is properly administered. The original premise of LV rescue was that the provision of reduced folate to normal cells would circumvent the metabolic block produced by MTX and allow resumption of DNA synthesis, although the presumed therapeutic selectivity of leucovorin has not yet been adequately explained. Despite a strong pharmacologic rationale and a vast clinical experience, HDMTX with leucovorin rescue has not been shown to be unequivocally superior to conventional doses of MTX in any clinical situation except, perhaps, for treatment of osteogenic sarcoma and childhood acute leukemia. While HDMTX is an important component of effective treatment regimens for these diseases, its precise contribution to the success of these regimens remains undefined. Although HDMTX can theoretically overcome all known mechanisms of MTX resistance, no data exist to suggest that this can be accomplished in the clinic. Thus, this well-known but poorly understood treatment regimen must remain a subject of clinical investigation rather than a part of routine clinical practice.","['Joint Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, IL.']",,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.12.2017 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The latter procedure also yields an appreciable number of pre-B cell lymphomas of uncertain origin. The results confirm Kaplan's theory that radiation induces thymic lymphomas in mice by an indirect mechanism. However, the previously described radiation leukemia virus is clearly not involved in the majority of transferred lymphomas.

This lymphoma grew as multiple submucosal nodules, some of which had coalesced into a mass in the terminal ileum. Histologically, the lesion resembled a lymphoma of follicular center-cell origin except for germinal centers that appeared reactive and greatly expanded follicular mantles. Flow cytometric studies showed that the lymphoma contained a monoclonal, kappa+ population of B-lymphocytes. Evaluation of sections of frozen tissue by an immunoperoxidase technique revealed that the germinal centers were polyclonal (nonneoplastic) and that the neoplastic cells were confined to the mantle zone. The additional information led to classification of the neoplasm as the mantle zone variant of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma. This type of lymphoma may pursue a more aggressive course than a follicular lymphoma derived from the germinal center.

We have previously characterized a human B-cell line (BALM-3) whose cells fail to express HLA class II molecules unless treated with phorbol acetate (TPA). Recently, we identified a spontaneous variant of BALM-3 whose cells express HLA class II molecules in the absence of TPA. Since normal B cells lose HLA class II molecules on terminal differentiation, these two BALM-3 cell populations may provide a model for a discrete phase of B-cell maturation. Alternatively, they may reflect two B-cell activation states characterized by quantitative differences in their expression of class II molecules. Expression of six of 22 additional surface molecules (HLA class I, CD23, p60, p124, p129, p141) increases by a factor of three or more as BALM-3 cells spontaneously acquire class II molecules while that of one of the 22 (p45) decreases by a comparable amount. Expression of the plasma cell-associated T10/CD38 antigen decreases by a factor of two. These additional surface molecules might also reflect lymphoid differentiation/activation antigens and/or participate in HLA class II-mediated cellular interactions and require further study.

The resistant cell lines were 22-123-fold resistant and were cross-resistant to a variety of drugs. Drug uptake and efflux were altered in the more resistant lines but not in the less resistant cells. Verapamil enhanced D1 cytotoxicity in all resistant lines; it inhibited D1 efflux in the higher resistant line thereby resulting in an increase in the cellular level of D1. However, this was not true for the less resistant line suggesting that verapamil enhancement of D1 toxicity in the less resistant line is probably due to other factors. Additionally, we have been unable to identify a marker glycoprotein in resistant cells. The changes observed in the resistant sublines are moderate and probably drug accumulation differences could not account for the degree of D1 resistance noted, nor could resistance be wholly reversed by calcium antagonist.

After a decade of discussions about the origin of the neoplastic cell, it has now been well established that hairy cells represent a certain, rather mature stage of B-cell differentiation. Evidence for this has been derived from studies using immunophenotyping with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, cytochemistry, and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. For many years, splenectomy was the only therapy of proven value in hairy cell leukemia. For patients who showed insufficient response to the operation, chemotherapy with low-dose alkylating agents was moderately successful, whereas polychemotherapy often resulted in excessive toxicity. More recently, therapy with alpha-interferon has been shown to be very promising, whereas deoxycoformicin may be an attractive alternative.

Early disease recurrence, rather than excessive toxicity and complications resulting in limitation of therapy is the major factor responsible for this disappointing outcome. The CCG-192P trial was a groupwide pilot study of the Childrens Cancer Study Group for the treatment of ALL in patients at high risk for relapse, which was defined by wbc count greater than 50 X 10(3)/microliters at diagnosis. Because of the recognized poor prognosis, all infants less than 1 year of age were entered in this study regardless of wbc count at diagnosis. Therapy included intensive induction and consolidation followed by a cyclic, sequential maintenance program. The CNS prophylaxis consisted of intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial irradiation, which was deferred until patients were greater than 1 year of age. During the period January 1982 to January 1984, 27 infants ranging in age from 2 days to 11 months who had ALL were entered in this study; 71% had wbc counts greater than 50 X 10(3)/microliters, and 23% presented with CNS leukemia. Complete remission was achieved in 93% of the patients. The median duration of remission is 17 months. With a median follow-up of 43 months, the life-table estimate of event-free survival (EFS) is 36% at 4 years. A recently reported historical control group of infants with ALL who were treated with previous Childrens Cancer Study Group protocols demonstrated a median remission duration of 8 months and an estimated EFS of only 21% at 4 years. Toxicity and therapy-related complications were not observed more frequently in infants than in older patients treated with this protocol. However, EFS of infants was significantly worse than that of patients greater than 1 year of age (P = less than 0.001). All four CNS relapses occurred in patients who had received cranial irradiation.

The reactivity of patient lymphocytes was as follows: 26 of 31 were positive for CD14 (Myr), 22 of 31 for a monocyte Fc receptor (MFC-1), 22 of 31 for CD11b (C3bi receptor), eight of 31 for CD15 (Leu-M1), five of 18 for CD13 (My 7), seven of 18 for My 9, and five of 30 for Mo 2. The B lymphocytes of B-CLL patients were also tested for the ability to produce interleukin 1 (IL-1) after depletion of monocytes and T lymphocytes. In 13 of 17 cases, B lymphocytes of patients produced IL-1 as detected in a mouse thymocyte proliferation assay and, in selected cases, a radioimmunoassay specific for IL-1 beta. The 13 cases that produced IL-1 were also positive for the expression of one or more myelomonocytic-associated antigens, whereas the four cases that did not produce IL-1 lacked expression of these antigens. In conclusion, the malignant B cells of B-CLL patients frequently express a variety of antigens generally considered specific for myelomonocytic cells, and expression of these antigens is associated with the ability to produce IL-1.","['Department of Medicine, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']","['CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-1)']",['S0006-4971(20)84883-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In cell lines with acquired multidrug resistance gene amplification has been frequently detected. Moreover, extra-copies of cellular oncogenes have been located in tumor cells in vivo; particularly N-myc gene amplification was discovered in advanced stage of neuroblastoma (NB). Neuroblastoma, a tumor of neural origin, has a high incidence in children. N-myc amplification has been demonstrated in untreated patient and a positive significant correlation with the progression of the disease has been established. In this paper we report on four NB patients treated with a polychemotherapeutic protocol and showing N-myc amplification. One patient examined before and after treatment displayed a slight change in N-myc gene copy numbers. It was shown that N-myc gene amplification is not affected by drug activities and that minimal residual of cells bearing N-myc amplification may remain in the tumor mass. N-myc amplification can also cause advantageous cell growth in the presence of drugs. The implications in the pharmacologic management of NB patient showing N-myc gene amplification is discussed.","[""Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, G.

This study evaluated the thymus glands of 36 human bone marrow transplant recipients dying between 4 and 1742 days after transplant using histology, histochemistry, and immunohistology. The observations lead to a model of thymic damage by irradiation, chemotherapy, and GVHD in which early injury by all three of these agents results in profound thymic atrophy followed by long-delayed restitution. Patients undergoing total body irradiation showed more severe damage to thymic cortical and medullary epithelium than did patients undergoing chemotherapy alone as preparation for transplantation. Patients with GVHD showed additional damage in the form of individual thymic epithelial cell death and showed HLA-DR surface protein expression on thymic epithelium during GVHD. Longer-term survivors showed a profoundly delayed restitution of normal thymic epithelium and delayed evidence of restored lymphopoiesis. A few patients dying late after transplant showed evidence of reconstitution of normal thymic structure or nodules of lymphopoiesis in focal areas of epithelial-cell reconstitution. Evidence of such lymphopoiesis was seen at times ranging between 90 and 1742 days after grafting.

In a 25-year period (1950-1984) 48 cases were diagnosed in our Institute, among which all the known forms of LMN, including the most uncommon such as multiple myeloma (1) and myeloid forms (4) including 1 chloroma and 1 erythraemic neoplasm. The incidence remains low; 1.17% of the diseased swine sent for necropsy, with no significant increase during the years. In the same period the incidence of other neoplasms was 1.14%. Also the data from the abattoir of Bologna confirm a low incidence: in the last 2 years lymphoid neoplasms were observed only twice among 130,000 slaughtered pigs (15 cases per million). This incidence is therefore similar to that noticed in slaughterhouses in other European countries and in the U.S.A. As for the anatomohistopathological features, lymphosarcoma presents a constant autochthonous production of immature collagen fibrils, but the degree of this production has no significant relation with either the macroscopic type of lesions, nodular or infiltrating (diffuse), or the level of cellular differentiation. Diffusely haemorrhagic lesions were observed in a relatively high percentage (14%) of lymphosarcomas. The incidence of myeloid neoplasms is relatively high compared with that of lymphosarcomas: from 5% of Italian cases as a whole to 14% of the cases studied in our Institute. This confirms that the pig is second to the dog as a domestic animal showing most of these myeloid neoplasms.","['Istituto di Patologia Generale e Anatomia Patologica, Facolta di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bologna, Italia.']",,,['10.1007/BF00346191 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

We reasoned that, because dominantly transforming genes (such as mutant alleles of ras proto-oncogenes) are found so frequently in acute leukaemia, the search for these genetic lesions during the clinical course of patients with MDS might give us insight into the function of oncogenes in leukaemogenesis. We report here that bone marrow cells from two of four patients with preleukaemia, and from one patient who progressed to acute leukaemia from MDS, contained a transforming allele of the Ki-ras proto-oncogene. In one preleukaemic patient, a novel mutation in codon 13 of this ras gene was detected in bone marrow cells harvested 1.5 years before the acute leukaemia developed.

We find that one of the alternative 5' exons of the gene lies at least 200 kilobases upstream of the remaining c-abl exons, posing formidable transcription and splicing problems. The 5'-most c-abl exon includes an unusually long 1,276-base-pair segment that contains 15 ATG codons and multiple short open reading frames, upstream of the abl initiator codon.

Studies on noncultured, freshly disaggregated biopsy material or of histological sections have not definitely established the cell lineage of HD cells, although evidence has been gathered that has allowed interpretation to favor one or the other hematopoietic cell type. In recent years a number of cell lines have been established from patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) which are claimed to represent in vitro counterparts of H-RS cells. The phenotypic and functional properties of 7 HD-derived cell lines are reviewed here. The cell lines are not identical; they show many common features, but also a number of important differences in their phenotypes as well as in their in vitro behavior. The cell lines differ with some having characteristics of T cells, others of B cells, and yet others of the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage. This heterogeneity of H-RS established cell lines could be explained in a variety of ways: (a) the heterogeneity of HD itself might result from a disease process which leads to fusion of different cell types resulting in different phenotypic forms of H-RS cells depending on the cells involved; (b) the different cell types might reflect differences in the malignant cells present in the separate subtypes of HD; (c) the difficulty in successfully establishing H-RS cell lines might mean that unrepresentative cell types adapt to in vitro conditions. Rather than resolve the origin of H-RS cells, the established HD-derived cell lines have been consistent with the heterogeneity described in histochemical, immunohistological, and immunocytochemical studies.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The stimulation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is rapid (less than an hour), occurs at picomolar concentrations of GM-CSF, and does not require the presence of GM-CSF during the killing reaction. Therefore, neutrophils may be targeted toward tumor cells by antibody and their tumoricidal activity enhanced by GM-CSF in vitro.

However, the tumor cells had interconnections with well-developed desmosomes. Enzyme histochemistry revealed strong 5'-nucleotidase activity. Immunohistologic analysis showed that tumor cells expressed two of three FDC-specific antigens (Ki-M4, BU-10, and R4/23) strongly. Virtually all myelomonocytic markers were absent. Like normal FDCs, the leukocyte antigens CD35, CD19, CD21, and CD23 were expressed strongly and CD4 antigen weakly. No staining was evident for CD45 antigen, and no nonhemopoietic cell markers were expressed. The origin of the normal FDC is obscure. Given some evidence suggesting a bone marrow origin for the FDC, this cell may represent a lineage distinct from other known cell lineages derived from bone marrow stem cells since its immune phenotype differs considerably from them.","['Laboratory of Immunohistology, University Institute of Pathology, Kommunehospitalet, Aarhus, Denmark.']",,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 20 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), seven non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), three acute myeloid leukemia, one refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and one chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. The cytogenetic findings were heterogeneous: 13 cases of del(9)(p21), among them four as sole karyotypic change; five cases of del(9)(p12), three of them as sole karyotypic change; four patients with i(9q), three with unbalanced translocations involving 9p12; and seven with unbalanced translocations involving 9p21. In addition, 10 patients showed known specific translocations for determined subgroups of ALL, NHL, and CML. The immunological phenotypes in the 20 ALL patients were common ALL (35%), pre-B-ALL (35%), B-ALL (5%), T-ALL (15%), and null ALL (10%). Three NHL were of T cell origin and the others of B cell origin. No specific association between the karyotypic change, immunophenotype, and clinical presentation could be ascertained for patients with ALL, acute myeloid leukemia, CML in blast crisis, and B-NHL. In T-NHL, three children with deletion of 9p, T immunoblastic lymphoma originating from common thymocyte and presenting with a mediastinal mass and pleural effusion may constitute a definite subgroup with good prognosis. All other cases had a poor outcome.

Individual McAbs were identified which are selectively reactive with antigenic determinants expressed by myeloid cells at specific stages of differentiation in a lineage-restricted fashion. The composite phenotype obtained by a combination of antimyeloid McAbs allows for a precise definition of the normal or malignant cell type under investigation. Cell binding studies on normal and leukemic cells and the biochemical characterization of the antigens provided the basis for a grouping of those antimyeloid McAbs into clusters of differentiation (CD). The reactivity patterns of CD11, CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33 McAbs and the characteristics of the respective antigens are reviewed. These CD McAbs distinguish leukemic cells of myeloid from those of lymphoid origin. The monocytic nature of AML cells can be recognized by CD14 McAbs, whereas the other CD McAbs react with both monocytic and nonmonocytic types of acute myeloid leukemia. The expression of these differentiation antigens is not concordant with the morphological-cytochemical French-American-British (FAB) classification of leukemia; nevertheless, tendencies for agreement are apparent. If used in combination, FAB typing and immunophenotyping could provide complementary information.

Acquired chromosomal changes have until now been reported in only 31 leukemic infants in this age group. Of the total material, 18 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 16 had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The by far most frequently recorded cytogenetic aberration has been t(4q;11q), seen in 14 cases of lymphoblastic leukemia. Although t(4q;11q) has not been found in a single patient with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, these leukemias have often had other rearrangements involving the same region of 11q. Hence, genetic material around 4q21 may be active in lymphocytic differentiation, whereas gene(s) in 11q23 may be important in the neoplastic process in a less cell-type specific manner and perhaps particularly vulnerable to neoplastic rearrangement in fetal life. The finding of four cases out of 34 with translocations between 11q23 and chromosome 19 indicates that this rearrangement might characterize a specific cytogenetic subgroup of leukemia in the very young.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, remission rates of 80-95% can be achieved in children and in 50-80% of adults with acute leukaemia. Attempts to cure patients in remission may entail either ""continuing curative chemotherapy"" or ""supralethal"" doses of chemoradiotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The relative merits of these different methods remain highly controversial but chemotherapy is usually the preferred method of continuing treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first remission; and allogeneic transplantation is recommended for younger adults with acute myeloid leukaemia who have suitable HLA-identical sibling donors.

The first, exemplified by bone sarcoma following therapeutic injection of 224Ra and chronic granulocytic leukemia in Japanese A-bomb survivors, is an early, wave-like pulse consisting of an increase in risk followed by a gradual decline back to baseline levels. The second, exemplified by breast cancer following a brief exposure to external gamma ray or X ray, and by lung cancer and stomach cancer in A-bomb survivors, is an increase in relative risk over about 10 years to a value which appears to remain constant over time thereafter. The first pattern suggests that tumor growth kinetics may play a central role in the temporal distribution of risk following exposure, while the second seems more consistent with multi-event models for carcinogenesis, in which radiation or some other cause of early events must be followed by one or more later events whose frequencies depend mainly on attained age. There are, however, other data that appear to conform to neither of the two models just mentioned.

The poor results of the latter combination - 49% clinical responses compared with 71% for ceftazidime - have been confirmed by the EORTC study group of Klastersky (1). The second study aimed at 30 patients who failed to respond to cefotaxime and gentamicin. All bacteriologically documented infections were cured with ceftazidime. The clinical response rate was 73%. In the third randomised study we compared ceftazidime plus flucloxacillin in 49 patients in order to extend the spectrum to resistant staphylococci with a ceftazidime monotherapy (51 patients). The addition of flucloxacillin did not improve the results substantially. The overall clinical response rate was 81% with the combination and 85% with ceftazidime alone.

Benzene is also a genotoxin, hematotoxin, and carcinogen. Chronic exposure causes aplastic anemia in humans and animals and is associated with increased incidence of leukemia in humans and lymphomas and certain solid tumors in rodents. Bioactivation of benzene is required for toxicity. In the liver, the major site of benzene metabolism, benzene is converted by a cytochrome P-450-mediated pathway to phenol, the major metabolite, and the secondary metabolites, hydroquinone and catechol. The target organ of benzene toxicity, the hematopoietically active bone marrow, metabolizes benzene to a very limited extent. Phenol is metabolized in the marrow cells by a peroxidase-mediated pathway to hydroquinone and catechol, and ultimately to quinones, the putative toxic metabolites. Benzene and its metabolites appear to be nonmutagenic, but they cause myeloclastogenic effects such as micronuclei, chromosome aberrations, and sister chromatid exchange. It is unknown whether these genomic changes, or the ability of the quinone metabolites to form adducts with DNA, are involved in benzene carcinogenicity. Benzene, through its active metabolites, appears to exert its hematological effects on the bone marrow stromal microenvironment by preventing stromal cells from supporting hemopoiesis of the various progenitor cells. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which benzene exerts its genotoxic, hematotoxic, and carcinogenic effects are detailed in this review.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']","['ES-02931/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-03724/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",['J64922108F (Benzene)'],['10.3109/10408448709089859 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This system, which was developed following previous work with murine marrow, appears to establish conditions that reproducibly allow the continuous turnover of a number of primitive progenitor cells, detected by their capacity upon transfer into semisolid assay cultures to generate limited numbers and types of mature blood cells. If not transferred, only those hemopoietic cells that are committed to the granulopoietic pathway are able to undergo terminal maturation. The demonstrated localization of the most primitive hemopoietic cells within the adherent fraction, primarily composed of nonhemopoietic mesenchymal elements expressing markers of fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth-muscle cells has provided indirect evidence that interactions between these cells may be key to the survival and functional integrity of normal stem cells in this system. Such a concept has received additional support from recent studies on the cell cycle control of primitive hemopoietic cells located in and dependent on this adherent network of nonhemopoietic elements. Applications of this culture system to neoplastic populations of hemopoietic cells has revealed a number of intriguing differences in their behavior. Under conditions where maintenance of neoplastic hemopoiesis can be achieved, the most primitive progenitor classes remain continuously in cycle as they do in vivo. Thus the same inability to respond to signals that induce a noncycling state in their normal counterparts appears to be reproduced in the long-term culture system. For some populations, e.g., most CML marrows and many AML marrows, neoplastic hemopoiesis fails to become established. Although the reasons for this are not yet clear, this behavior is of interest, not only because it offers a sensitive method for detecting residual normal cells, but also as a practical approach to purging marrows of leukemic cells for autologous marrow transplantation.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

We have shown that the N2 vector will transfer a functional bacterial gene for neomycin resistance (NeoR) into more than 80% of mouse spleen foci. A derivative of the N2 vector was constructed to study transfer and expression of the human gene for adenosine deaminase (ADA) in mammalian lymphoid and hematopoietic stem cells. This vector, termed SAX, contains the human ADA cDNA with an SV40 promoter in addition to the NeoR gene. The SAX vector was found to efficiently transfer and express the ADA gene in an ADA-deficient human T-cell line. Gene transfer by SAX using an autologous nonhuman primate bone marrow transplant model resulted in expression of the human ADA gene in peripheral blood cells of treated animals. Human bone marrow treated with SAX produced 1%-2% of colonies in vitro that were expressing the vector genes. Transfer of genes into circulating hematopoietic stem cells of fetal sheep in utero was most efficient; vector gene expression was evident in 20%-40% of hematopoietic colonies. Therefore, retroviral vectors are capable of transferring functional genes into a wide variety of mammalian lymphoid and hematopoietic cells. Such vectors may be useful for clinical trials of gene therapy, that is, the correction of genetic diseases by insertion of a normal gene into a patient's defective cells.","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Commitment is first detected by 12 hours and is associated with persistent suppression of c-myb gene transcription. Transcription of the erythroid-specific genes, alpha 1 and beta maj globin, is increased 10- to 30-fold, whereas synthesis of rRNA is suppressed, and there is activation or suppression of a number of additional genes that remain to be characterized.

Phenol (10(-4) M) was also found to have a marked toxicity on stromal cell colony formation. BFU-E binding with human-tumor necrosis factor (rHu-TNF) was linear with the number of BFU-E colonies. Recombinant rHu-TNF suppressed BFU-E growth in a dose-dependent manner and this was reversed with anti-TNF antibody. Binding studies of rHu-TNF for human K562 cells indicated that K562 cells have a binding constant of approximately 1075 per cell. The heme pathway enzymes, uroporphyrinogen deaminase, and heme oxygenase activities were measured in BFU-E cultures exposed to iron, interleukins (1 and 2), and various lymphocyte and macrophage-conditioned media with or without hemin. In most instances, hemin was found to stimulate the heme synthetic pathway in the presence of these agents. Iron and adherent (macrophage) cell conditioned media (CM) were found to stimulate heme oxygenase activity. Macrophage CM was found to suppress erythropoiesis in contrast to phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte (PHAL)-CM, which enhanced erythroid growth. In addition, porphobilinogen deaminase levels were greater in 14-day cultures containing hemin plus PHAL-CM as compared with hemin alone.

In contrast to our previous findings in recipients of unfractionated marrow, during weeks 3 to 7 post-SBA-E-BM transplantation (BMT), PBMC from the majority of patients spontaneously released IL-2 into the culture medium. This IL-2 was not produced by Leu-11+ natural killer cells, which were found to be predominant in the circulation at this time, but by T11+, T3+, Ia antigen-bearing T cells. The IL-2 production could be enhanced by coculture with host PBMC frozen before transplant but not by stimulation with mitogenic amounts of OKT3 antibody, thus suggesting an in vivo activation of donor T cells or their precursors by host tissue. Spontaneous IL-2 production was inversely proportional to the number of circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes and ceased after 7 to 8 weeks post-SBA-E-BMT in most of the patients. In patients whose cells had ceased to produce IL-2 spontaneously or never produced this cytokine, neither coculture with host cells nor stimulation with OKT3 antibody thereafter induced IL-2 release through the first year posttransplant. Proliferative responses to exogenous IL-2 after stimulation with OKT3 antibody remained abnormal for up to 6 months post-SBA-E-BMT, unlike the responses of PBMC from recipients of conventional BM, which responded normally by 1 month post-BMT. However, the upregulation of IL-2 receptor expression by exogenous IL-2 was found to be comparable to normal controls when tested as early as 3 weeks post-SBA-E-BMT. Therefore, the immunologic recovery of proliferative responses to IL-2 and the appearance of cells regulating in vivo activation of T cells appear to be more delayed in patients receiving T cell-depleted BMT. Similar to patients receiving conventional BMT, however, the ability to produce IL-2 after mitogenic stimulation remains depressed for up to 1 year after transplantation.","['Laboratory of Cytokine Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['CA 23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (soybean lectin)']",['S0006-4971(20)79549-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In CML, the molecular events resulting from the Ph translocation include a break within the bcr locus on chromosome 22, transfer of the c-abl protooncogene from chromosome 9 to 22, and formation of an aberrant 210-kD bcr-abl fusion protein (p210bcr-abl). Recently, the absence of bcr rearrangement and expression of a distinct aberrant 190-kd abl protein (p190c-abl) has been described in Ph-positive ALL, with the suggestion that the two abl variants may be pathogenetically associated with myeloid v lymphoid leukemogenesis. Here we report that the genomic configuration and translation product of Ph-positive AML can be similar to that of Ph-positive ALL: the break at 22q11 may occur outside the 5.8 kb bcr region and result in expression of a 190-kD abl protein lacking these bcr sequences. Phosphokinase enzymatic activity, a fundamental property of p210bcr-abl, was also associated with AML-derived p190c-abl. Our current observations indicate that p190c-abl can be found in cells of lymphoid or myeloid lineage and is therefore unlikely to play a specific role in the development of lymphoid leukemias. Formation of p190c-abl instead of p210bcr-abl appears to be a characteristic of the acute rather than the chronic Ph-positive leukemic state.","['Department of Clinical Immunology, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston, TX 77030.']",,,['S0006-4971(20)79547-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

It is desirable to distinguish alloimmunization from nonimmunologic causes of poor platelet survival to assess the need for HLA-matched, single-donor platelets. We describe a new in vitro assay for anti-HLA antibodies and report its application to the problem of platelet crossmatching. In contrast to previously described crossmatch techniques, the immunobead assay is specific for anti-HLA antibodies. The assay was used to evaluate 51 single-donor platelet transfusions given to seven patients from 35 different donors. Recipient plasma was assayed for antibodies directed against HLA antigens present on donor platelets. A one-hour posttransfusion corrected count increment of greater than or equal to 7,500 was considered a successful outcome. Twenty-nine of 33 (87.9%) transfusion episodes associated with a negative immunobead assay had successful outcomes. The four unsuccessful transfusions were associated with potential nonimmunologic causes of poor platelet survival. Only two of 18 (11.1%) episodes associated with a positive assay had successful outcomes. Only one unsuccessful transfusion episode was associated with a negative immunobead assay and a positive radiolabeled antiglobulin test result, which suggested that isolated alloantibodies to antigens other than class I HLA antigens are not a common cause of platelet refractoriness.

The patient population was heterogenous with respect to diagnosis and disease status. They included individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aplastic anemia, and a few other hematopoietic malignancies. The frequency of various clonogenic precursors in the normal donor population varied considerably. The data yielded a symmetrical distribution. In contrast, most bone marrow transplant recipients presented with significantly reduced numbers of clonogenic cells before transplantation, resulting in skewed distribution profiles. Serial studies of recipients demonstrated a significantly lower than normal level of clonogenic precursors even 3 and 4 years after transplantation. The median values and distribution profiles approximated those observed before transplantation but did not return to measurements obtained for normal donors. Patients with ALL deviated from this pattern. The median values and distribution profiles of clonogenic precursors before transplantation approximated the pattern of normal donors. The frequency of clonogenic progenitors after transplantation, however, remained significantly lower than that of their respective donor or pretransplant values. Cell cycle studies performed after normalization of peripheral blood hematopoietic parameters demonstrated for most recipients that a higher than normal proportion of multipotent cells was in S-phase (P = .011). By univariate and multivariate approaches, clonogenic precursors and clinical parameters were assessed for their contributions to clinical outcome as measured by time to engraftment and survival time. The number of nucleated cells in the transplant inoculum contributed to survival independent of other risk factors. Patients with a higher cell load had a higher probability of surviving than did patients with a lower cell concentration in the transplant inoculum (P = .042). The frequency of clonogenic precursors in the transplant inoculum altered neither survival nor time to engraftment. The time to engraftment was significantly influenced by the frequency of clonogenic megakaryocyte precursors (CFU-M) observed in recipients prior to transplantation (P = .003). Patients with high values engrafted faster than did patients with a low frequency of CFU-M.

Pharmacokinetic studies revealed rapid cell uptake and outputs in bile (20%) and urine (8%) in 24 hours. Transfer to third spaces were poor but definite. In vivo a part of THP was converted to ADM in the liver, but not in other tissues including tumors. THP would be an extremely interesting compound, because of comparable spectrum of responses to various tumors with extremely low toxicity compared with other anthracycline compounds.","['Chiba Cancer Center, Japan.']",,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Several leukaemias have been described which secrete growth factors which may be involved in autocrine stimulation of cell proliferation. One of these leukaemias is WEHI-3B, a myelomonocytic leukaemia that constitutively produces interleukin-3 (IL-3). Cloning of the IL-3 gene has enabled us to investigate possible genetic changes in this gene in WEHI-3B cells which may have resulted in autonomous production of growth factor. We have shown that one of the IL-3 genes in WEHI-3B has been rearranged, as a result of the insertion of a 5.1 kilobase intracisternal A-type particle genome head to head with the 5' end of the IL-3 gene, 215 bases upstream of the IL-3 TATA box. The rearranged gene, when cloned into a lambda EMBL3A vector, could readily be expressed in COS-1 monkey cells, whereas the normal gene, in the same vector, was silent. Thus the insertion of the endogenous retroviral element has resulted in abnormal expression of the IL-3 gene and is postulated to have been a key genetic change in the development of this leukaemia. In an attempt to experimentally construct IL-3 producing leukaemias, IL-3 responsive FDC-P1 and 32D cl-23 cells were transfected with a retroviral expression vector containing the IL-3 gene. This resulted in autonomous production of IL-3 and continuous proliferation of the transfected cells. As a result of transfection, the FDC-P1 and 32D cl-23 cells became leukemogenic demonstrating the oncogenic potential of abnormal expression of IL-3. The autocrine nature of the experimental leukaemias was demonstrated by blocking their proliferation with an IL-3 neutralising antiserum. Similarly treated cultures of normal bone marrow cells also produced IL-3 and could be maintained for several months after transfection but were not leukemogenic. The factor-dependent cell lines are unable to differentiate in the presence of known CSF's and presumably have undergone other genetic changes which allow them to become leukemogenic when autocrine-stimulated. In contrast, the transfected bone marrow cells could differentiate and form colonies containing mature granulocytes and macrophages. The non-tumorigenic behaviour of the transfected bone marrow cells is consistent with the concept that several other genetic changes which effectively block differentiation are required for development of tumorigenicity in these cells.","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Australian National University, Canberra.']",,['0 (Interleukin-3)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of these reports are reviewed and critiqued. The reports of clinical effects of electric and/or magnetic fields among human populations present serious difficulties which stem from the many publications in which pertinent material is not presented, and the data are variable or internally inconsistent. The reports presented so far are not very probing. The numbers of subjects are small, the epidemiologic methodologies are often weak, measurements of intensity of field are absent, and the statistical analyses utilized are not always appropriate. Although suggestive associations of electric/magnetic fields and cancer or leukemia have been made, no one has established a causal relationship between these fields and cancer or leukemia. All the reports on human exposure have numerous deficiencies which include: lack of or imprecise measurements of electric or magnetic field intensities, questionable subject identification, lack of statistical significance, confounding with uncontrolled variables such as socioeconomic differences, smoking, X rays, drugs, population mobility, and the unreliability of occupational classification. Nevertheless the possibility of a link between leukemia and cancer and exposure to electric and magnetic fields has been raised and only responsible research can refute or confirm these reports.","['Department of Radiation Biology and Biophysics, University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642.']",,,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37646.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Anticoagulation therapy in these patients is occasionally complicated by several factors including thrombocytopenia, which may result in a life-threatening situation of hemorrhage versus pulmonary emboli. Mechanical intervention may prevent pulmonary emboli from reaching the lungs, thereby negating the use of anticoagulants in the patient with thrombocytopenia. In this clinical trial, ten patients with cancer and thrombocytopenia complicated by recurrent pulmonary emboli received the Kim-Ray Greenfield filter. There were four men (two with colon carcinoma and two with chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and six women (four with breast carcinoma, one with colon carcinoma, and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Pulmonary emboli were documented in all patients by comparative ventilation/perfusion lung scans, arterial blood gas determinations, and chest x-ray films.

She had two physical findings suggestive of possible insulin action: cystic ovarian enlargement with gonadotropin-independent steroid secretion and persistent, severe myocardial hypertrophy. To examine the pathophysiology of this disorder we measured the in vitro sensitivity to insulin and other growth factors of erythroid progenitors and a T-lymphoblast cell line derived from her peripheral blood. Resistance to insulin was demonstrated by failure of her circulating erythroid progenitor cells to augment proliferation in response to physiologic concentrations of insulin (1-10 ng/ml). An immortalized T lymphoblast cell line was established by transforming the cells with the human retrovirus human T cell leukemia virus II. This cell line showed little or no response to physiologic concentrations of insulin contrary to consistently observed stimulation of colony formation by cell lines similarly derived from normals. The patient's T lymphoblasts, however, showed normal sensitivity to insulin-like growth factor I. In response to supraphysiologic insulin concentrations (25-1000 ng/ml), leprechaun T lymphoblasts showed significant augmentation of colony formation (peak 189% above baseline at 50 ng/ml); normal T lymphoblasts also showed responsiveness at these high insulin concentrations. Preincubation with a monoclonal antibody against the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (alpha IR-3 at 5000 ng/ml) blocked the in vitro effect of physiologic concentrations of insulin-like growth factor and supraphysiologic concentrations of insulin on leprechaun and control T lymphoblast colony formation, but had no clear effect upon the response to physiologic insulin concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Pediatrics, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']","['CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['0 (Insulin)'],['10.1203/00006450-198709000-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

It is admitted that T lymphocytes of graft origin become the effector cells reacting against the host tissues. It is possible to deplete the vast majority of T cells from the BM inoculum using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) of the anti-pan T specificity. The two most currently used methods are the complement-dependent cytolysis and the use of immunotoxins (MoAb combined to ricin). The T cell depletion is the most effective procedure for the prevention of GvH (less than 10% versus 40 to 60% in the historical series). However, this mode of prevention can induce resistance phenomena towards the graft acceptance (15 to 20% of cases). This complication can be prevented by the in vivo use of MoAb specific for the host's radioresistant cells. Another alternative way consists in the reinforcement of conditioning aiming both at the elimination of residual immunocompetent cells and at a more efficient action upon the imperceptible tumoral mass.

As survival increases, so does the recognition that the treatment used to prolong survival may have significant detrimental effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Because of the slow replication rate of most constituents of the CNS, these effects tend to be delayed. Radiotherapy, and to a lesser extent, chemotherapy (primarily methotrexate) have been implicated in the causation of such sequelae. The pathogenesis of CNS damage is only partially understood and evidence suggests that direct effects on intracranial endothelial cells and brain white matter and immunologic mechanism play a role. A spectrum of clinical syndromes may occur, including radionecrosis, necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, mineralizing microangiopathy with dystrophic calcification, cerebellar sclerosis and spinal cord dysfunction. The two most common forms of sequelae are neuropsychological and neuroendocrinologic damage. The frequency, degree of and etiology of neurocognitive dysfunction is less than completely elucidated. Radiotherapy has been implicated as the major cause of damage, but the relationship between radiotherapy and the type of damage caused and the volume and dose of radiotherapy and degree of cognitive damage is unclear. Cognitive deficits are progressive in nature. Younger children are more likely to suffer the severest damage; but no patient of any age is free of risk of damage. Growth hormone impairment is the most common form of neuroendocrinologic dysfunction. There is increasing evidence that children with cancer who are long-term survivors are at increased risk for the development of secondary CNS tumors; possibly due, in part, to previous treatment. Much work needs to be done to characterize the sequelae which may occur, develop means of earlier detection, investigate ways to ameliorate sequelae and devise less toxic treatment.","[""Cancer Research Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.""]",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1002/mpo.2950150505 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

All other regimens included radiation therapy as prophylaxis.

Fifty-five of these 100 had no subsequent CNS episodes. Only 17 of these 55 patients are surviving without further relapses since the CNS episode. The median time to isolated CNS relapse was 457 days. Time to the initial CNS relapse was found to be the most important factor for predicting outcome.

Hereditary cancers usually have one genetic lesion already existing prezygotically; therefore only one additional mutational event is required in the homologous gene to complete the process of neoplastic transformation. In nonhereditary neoplasms, both mutations must occur postzygotically. 3. Individuals with high spontaneous mutation rates (monitored by chromosome breakage rates) are more liable to acquire specific genetic lesions than those with low mutation rates; therefore they are at higher risk to develop neoplasms. 4. Individuals with genetic defects in response to damage induced by mutagens (carcinogens) are more liable to accumulate genetic lesions than those who are more resistant; therefore, they are more liable to develop cancers. Mutagen sensitivity or resistance is probably genetic expression of DNA repair capabilities. 5. An effective assay method for sensitivity or resistance to mutagens can be developed to analyze the human population to identify the at-risk fraction.","['Section of Cellular Genetics, University of Texas, M.

By using a basic screening panel of antibodies on fresh-frozen sections, LPD can be reliably immunophenotyped. Fourteen patterns of immunoreactivity have been identified that can be used in differential diagnosis and the establishment of the correct diagnosis. A comprehensive table has been developed for systematically recording for each case the results of immunohistologic evaluation of fresh-frozen sections. The information recorded is easily computerized for later studies of large numbers of cases. We also propose a strategy for the further characterization of rare cases that are not easily defined with the basic screening panel of immunologic reagents. The proposed systematic approach allows the rapid recognition of the predominant immunologic pattern, the determination of the differential diagnoses, and the establishment of the correct diagnosis. In many cases, the final diagnosis can be predicted on the basis of patterns of immunoreactivity in the fresh-frozen section prior to the evaluation of the paraffin-embedded histologic material. Moreover, this systematic approach may provide an additional method to classify LPD more precisely and reproducibly.","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphomas, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']","['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']","['S0046-8177(87)80222-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80222-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Intrauterine death was found to occur in association with maternal homeostatic alterations resulting from phenylketonuria and diabetes, and with maternal toxicity from toxemia of pregnancy, leukemia, burns, alcohol, aminopterin, isotretinoin, and possibly trimethadione. A pattern of anomalies found similar (except for minor differences) and thus suggestive of a possible common cause, was observed among anomalies to phenylketonuria, diabetes mellitus, aminopterin, alcohol, warfarin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, trimethadione, valproic acid, and isotretinoin. The pattern usually consisted of deficiencies in pre- and postnatal development, mid-facial hypoplasia, cleft palate, atrial or ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, hypospadias, hernias, and other less frequent anomalies. The pattern is tentatively associated with alterations in maternal physiology resulting from phenylketonuria and diabetes; maternal toxicity of aminopterin, alcohol, and diverse factors co-occurring with warfarin use; and therapeutic doses (generally toxic in adults) of phenytoin, phenobarbital, trimethadione, and valproic acid. Whether these fetal malformations and intrauterine deaths would occur at nonmaterno-toxic levels of the above teratogenic agents, and, consequently, the strength of the associations could not be estimated for lack of data.

Several recent studies which have quantified the risk of treatment-induced cancers following gynecologic malignancies are reviewed. After cervical cancer, there is a 9% excess risk of second cancers, of which only 5% could be attributed to radiation therapy. Most of the treatment-related malignancies after cervical or endometrial cancer are solid tumors occurring within the radiation field. Following both cervical and endometrial cancer, there is a small increased risk of leukemia associated with radiation therapy. In contrast, after ovarian cancer, there is significantly increased risk of leukemia related to treatment with alkylating agents, which varies by drug type and total dose. The cumulative risk of leukemia and preleukemia following single agent melphalan is 11.2% +/- 2.6% at ten years; the risk after cyclophosphamide is 5.4% +/- 3.2%.

This new cell type is biphenotypic, expressing terminal transferase (TdT) together with myelomonocytoid immunologic features. TdT enzymatic activity, undetectable in HL-60, was determined to be 140 to 180 units/10(8) HL-T cells by the dGTP-assay, approximately 20% of the activity found in lymphoblastoid cell lines. HL-T predominantly synthesize the known 58-kDa TdT-protein plus a minor 54/56-kDa doublet. The 58-kDa steady state form is nonglycosylated and is phosphorylated. Precursor antigens S3.13 and MY-10, absent on HL-60, are expressed by HL-T; however, the cells are negative for HLA-Dr. Southern blot analysis by hybridization with immunoglobulin heavy chain (JH) and T cell-receptor chain gene (T beta) probes shows JH to be in the germ-line configuration in both cell lines and the T beta gene to be in germ-line in HL-60 but to be rearranged in HL-T. Truncation of the gene encoding the granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), as found in HL-60, is not observed in HL-T. HL-T are resistant to differentiation-induction by retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cytogenetically HL-T share with HL-60 a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 at breakpoint p13, an aberration frequently found in patients with T cell leukemia. In addition, HL-T display t(8;9)(p11;p24) and trisomy 20. Tetraploidy is observed in 80% of HL-T metaphases with aberrations identical to those in the diploid karyotype.

Using the avidin-biotin-complex immunoperoxidase procedure, BM-1 was found to stain selectively myeloid precursor cells in normal bone marrow and mature granulocytes in the blood. In a screen of 26 normal adult and fetal human organs fixed in B5 formalin, BM-1 was negative in all nonhematopoietic tissues with the exception of tissue granulocytes and scattered cells in the peripheral cortex of the thymus. Likewise a screen of 30 solid tumor cell lines including a spectrum of carcinomas, sarcomas, and neural-derived tumors was negative. BM-1 was also negative with 21 T and B cell lymphomas and 11 Hodgkin's disease tumors. A preliminary study of tumors of the hematopoietic system revealed that BM-1 was reactive with M2 and M3 acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) and myelomonocytic leukemias, and granulocytic sarcomas. M1, M4, M5, and M6 AML clot preparations were negative in this study, indicating that BM-1 may have a role in the histopathologic diagnosis of myelogenous leukemia. Myeloid leukemic cell lines HL-60, ML-2, KG1, and TPH-1-O showed BM-1 nuclear and/or cytoplasmic reactivity in a subpopulation of cells, but erythroid and lymphoid leukemias and all lymphoma cell lines were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies of a panel of fetal tissues showed BM-1 positive cells in the peripheral cortex of the thymus and portal myelopoietic regions of the liver at 18 weeks gestation. Finally, DNA-cellulose and solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques developed in our laboratory demonstrate that the BM-1 antigenic domain is reactive only after binding to eukaryotic but not prokaryotic single- or double-stranded DNA. Immunoblot techniques using a DNA-cellulose purified protein sample revealed that BM-1 recognizes a 183 kD protein. These studies indicate that BM-1 is recognizing a myeloid-specific antigen that, because of its DNA binding characteristics, may have an important role in the differentiation of myeloid cells at the molecular level.","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['R01-CA-40608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)']",['S0006-4971(20)81865-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

After incubation of intact bacteria with 100 microM [3H]F-ara-A, [3H]F-Ade was the same percentage of cellular radioactivity as in the medium, but it was only one-tenth the concentration of F-ara-A in the cells. In contrast, the cellular concentration of 2-fluoro-ATP was 20-fold greater than that of F-ara-A-5'-triphosphate. These results suggest that F-ara-A entered the bacteria intact and was phosphorolytically cleaved to liberate F-Ade, which would have been either anabolized to the toxic triphosphate or excreted. The latter pathway would provide a route by which F-Ade might be absorbed into the host circulation.",,['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '1492-62-2 (2-fluoro-ATP)', '2C8H3H4EBG (2-fluoroadenine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']","['0006-2952(87)90207-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90207-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemic cells this recombination results in the transcription of a 8.5 kb bcr/c-abl hybrid RNA which is translated into a p210 abl protein. The p210 abl protein contains, in contrast to its normal 145 abl counterpart, associated tyrosine kinase activity which is not physiologically controlled. Both genes do not participate in the acceleration of CML from chronic state into blast crisis. The majority of CML patients without cytogenetically detectable Ph chromosome also lack a bcr/abl rearrangement. However, some cases of Ph-negative CML could be reclassified into the group of Ph-positive CML by demonstration of a bcr gene rearrangement. One patient exhibited a bcr gene recombination without translocation of c-abl sequences. A similar heterogenous pattern is observed in Ph-positive acute leukemias. About 50% of cases are characterized by a bcr/abl rearrangement, as is likewise observed in Ph-positive CML. It is tempting to speculate that these patients represent Ph-positive CML cases that initially presented themselves for treatment with CML blast crisis. Particularly in pediatric Ph-positive ALL, the majority of cases show a c-abl oncogene translocation without bcr rearrangement. Precise molecular-genetic analyses of those cases are still pending. Molecular-genetic analyses have already been proven to be of clinical value 1) in the diagnosis of Ph-positive CML in the absence of cytogenetic methods, 2) in the subclassification of Ph-negative CML or Ph-positive acute leukemias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,['10.1159/000216391 [doi]'],,,Molekulargenetische Untersuchungen zur Pathogenese und Klassifizierung der chronisch myeloischen Leukamie.,,,,,,,,

In clinical practice, certain new methods of immunotyping (IT) are of diagnostic importance in assigning undifferentiated tumors to lymphoid, epithelial or mesenchymal origin and in defining subgroups of leukemias and lymphomas. The demonstration of rearrangements of gene coding for immunoglobulins or T-cell receptors assigns hematological malignancies of early differentiation to the B- or T-cell lineage, discriminates between reactive lymphoid changes and clonal lymphoid expansion and detects persistent clonal growth after therapy. In certain clinical entities (e.g. ALL) the immunological subtypes are of importance for differential therapy. By means of IT new clinical entities have been defined (Ki-1-lymphoma, T gamma-lymphoproliferative, LFA-1-deficiency) and the pathomechanisms of others have been elucidated (Bernard-Soulier-disease Syndrome, Glanzmann-Nageli thrombasthenia). Of immediate therapeutic importance is the identification by IT of receptors for specific hormones or biological response modifiers on malignant cells.

Among the proposed mechanisms for the development of bronchiolitis after allogeneic BMT, the 2 most likely are graft-versus-host disease directly causing bronchiolitis, and increased immunosuppressive therapy given for graft-versus-host disease predisposing to viral bronchiolitis. The available evidence would suggest that it is prudent to obtain serial pulmonary function tests even in asymptomatic patients post-BMT, and particularly in those with chronic graft-versus-host disease, in the hope that early detection will allow for early intervention that will arrest or reverse the progression of the obstructive airways disease.",,,,['10.1097/00005792-198709000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Light-chain-restricted B cells became reduced in parallel with the disappearance of morphological HCs. Absolute numbers of T cells were reduced, Leu2a+ preferentially, resulting in an increase in helper/suppressor ratios.

It was the aim to qualify the in vivo cytoreduction as a new predictor for therapy failure. All patients were exposed for 7 days to prednisone before combination chemotherapy at day 8 has been started. At day 0 one additional dose of Methotrexate was given intrathecally. Therapy for all patients with non-B-ALL has been stratified according to initial tumor burden (risk factor) providing four therapy branches: standard risk low (SR-L), standard risk high (SR-H), medium risk (MR), high risk (HR). After a median duration of study of 21 months, event-free survival (EFS) is for all 630 patients 73%, 81% for SR-L, 76% for SR-H, 69% for MR, and 35% for HR patients (date of evaluation Jan. 1, 1987). In this prospective study, a small subgroup of patients (n = 48; 7.6% of total group) is characterized by greater than 1000 leukemic blasts/mm3 peripheral blood at day 8 after exposure to prednisone. In this subgroup the EFS is only 43% in contrast to 76% in the complementary group of 582 patients with less than 1000 leukemic blasts/mm3 peripheral blood at day 8. Patients of that risk group are derived from therapy branches SR-H, M and HR, the latter contributing relatively most patients. In this negatively selected group all patients with an initial high white blood count, CNS disease at diagnosis, immune subtypes as prae-T-ALL (n = 6), T-ALL (n = 18), null-ALL (n = 5), and males clearly dominate. Of 48 patients with greater than 1000 blasts/mm3 at day 8 4 subsequently failed to enter remission and 8 were qualified as lateresponders. 18 patients relapsed, most of them earlier compared to those of the complementary group. The initial in vivo response on corticosteroid therapy is considered a supplementary prognostic predictor for early failure. It will be utilized in trial ALL/NHL-BFM 86 to qualify patients at the highest risk for relapse. This group of patients is supplemented in addition by non- and lateresponders and children with acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL). The in vivo corticosteroid test is simple, generates early and reliable results and can be obtained almost always.

Here only therapy results of 611 patients with non-B-ALL are presented. Patients with ALL of B-type are described elsewhere. In this fourth consecutive trial of the BFM study group three major questions have been asked: 1. Is it possible to assess the individual risk for relapse more accurately by the use of a risk factor rather than by the risk score which was the discriminator in studies ALL-BFM 76 and ALL-BFM 79? Does this risk factor discriminate more precisely patients at the highest risk for relapse? Offers more intensive risk-adapted therapy to this patient group a better chance for disease-free survival? 2. In patients at a standard risk for relapse with a risk factor below 1.2--approximately 60% of patients with non-B-ALL--can radiotherapy for prevention of CNS disease effectively be replaced by chemotherapy (intermediate dose Methotrexate)? 3. It is possible to reduce duration of maintenance therapy by 6 months to a total duration of 18 months with no unfavorable effect? To assess the radiation problem in standard risk patients and to evaluate the importance of duration of maintenance therapy two randomisations have been utilized. After a median duration of study ALL-BFM 81 of 4 1/2 years and 3 1/4 years after the study had been closed (date of evaluation January 1, 87) the answers are as follows: 1. For the majority of patients risk-adapted therapy had a curative effect. The probability for event-free survival (EFS) in standard risk patients in slightly above 70%, in medium risk patients 67%. In high-risk patients risk-adapted therapy did not improve prognosis, the EFS being still in the order of 50%. A good assessment of the individual risk for relapse is possible by the newly introduced risk factor. This principle is superior to the risk score used in former studies ALL-BFM 76 and ALL-BFM 79 because a low risk group (risk factor below 0.8) could be identified including approximately 25% of all patients with non-B ALL. Selection, quality, and timing of therapy elements remain the decisive prognostic factors, however. 2. Standard risk patients with a risk factor below 0.8 can effectively be protected for CNS relapse by treatment with intermediate dose Methotrexate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,['10.1055/s-2008-1026780 [doi]'],,,Die Behandlung der akuten lymphoblastischen Leukamie im Kindes- und Jugendalter: Ergebnisse der multizentrischen Therapiestudie ALL-BFM 81.,,,,,,,,

This has been accomplished largely through mutational analysis of the genotype of retroviruses or through the analysis of tumor cell DNA by in vitro transfection of rodent fibroblasts. Oncogenes are believed to arise by some genetic alteration from normal cellular genes called proto-oncogenes. Although the normal function of most proto-oncogenes is unknown, it has been proposed that they may function as tissue-specific and temporally specific regulators of differentiation. The role of oncogenes in lymphoid malignancies has been extensively analyzed. Less is known about their role in myeloid leukemias and especially in normal myelopoiesis.

Like the indolent B-cell lymphomas, they cannot be cured by currently available systemic chemotherapy so new systemic therapies need to be developed. A study of very high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2a was, therefore, initiated in 20 patients with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (5 in stage II, 2 in stage III and 13 in stage IV). All patients were refractory to at least 2 standard therapies, including topical nitrogen mustard (18 patients), psoralens and ultraviolet A light (12 patients), total skin electron irradiation (14 patients) and systemic chemotherapy (16 patients). Nine out of 20 patients (45%; 95% confidence interval 25-69%) had either objective partial or complete responses within 3 months of starting treatment. Maximal response, however, often did not occur for at least one year. The median duration of response was 5.5 months and all complete responses lasted more than 2 years. Response frequencies were equal at both cutaneous and extracutaneous sites and in patients with or without prior chemotherapy.

A second IgE peak was recorded in 16% of evaluable treatment periods. In the transplanted leukemia and aplastic anemia patients, the rise of serum IgE levels occurred at the same time, i.e. at a mean of 14 days after transplantation; it occurred significantly later in children grafted for severe combined immunodeficiency.

This aggressive approach seemed to be justified for a group of patients who were at the highest risk for ultimate treatment failure. In all, 38 children were enrolled for study. The ratio of male (median age, 10 years) to female (median age, 13 years) subjects was 27:11. Thirty patients were treated for their first relapse and eight for their second or subsequent relapse. Isolated bone marrow involvement was present in 24 cases. All patients had received heavy pretreatment including anthracyclines with cumulative doses of between 120 and 240 mg/m2. 22 of these patients, achieved complete remission, ten did not respond to therapy, and six died from the toxicity of the protocol. Cardiac failure was the cause of death in one child (after additional radiotherapy for a mediastinal mass). No further clinical manifestation of cardiomyopathy could be observed. The other five patients died from hemorrhages or infectious complications. The main side effects were fever, gastrointestinal problems, stomatitis, and severe bone marrow aplasia lasting for about 2 weeks with nadirs of platelets and white blood count around days 10-14.

In the first protocol (SAKK AML 74, from August 1974 to April 1977; 107 patients) the effectiveness of immunization with viral oncolysate during maintenance treatment was tested. After successful induction treatment, the patients were randomized in two groups: Group A: monthly maintenance chemotherapy for 2 years and group A+IT, which received the same maintenance chemotherapy regimen plus, on day 15, injection of viral oncolysate. Of the 107 patients, 57 (53%) achieved complete remission, 29 then being randomized to group A, 28 to group A+IT. As of August 1984, there is no statistical difference between the survival times of the two groups (p = 0.288). Ten years after the start of the study there is still no clear plateau of the survival curve. Nine percent of all patients (18% of the remission patients) are alive today. With the treatment of the mid-seventies, therefore, the cure of a patient suffering from AML was a rare event. The second protocol (SAKK AML 77, from April 1977 to April 1982; 162 patients) was designed to evaluate the usefulness of a prolonged maintenance treatment after early consolidation. The 74 patients who were still in remission after early consolidation treatment were assigned to either maintenance chemotherapy or to observation only. At 3.5 years after the last patient's entry there was no difference between the groups in duration of survival (p = 0.332).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",['10.1007/978-3-642-71213-5_7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In 74 cases the indication was acute leukemia in relapse (n = 23) or in first or consecutive remission (n = 51). The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide or the combination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. All patients were treated under strict gnotobiotic care. To mitigate the risk of CMV infections, intravenous CMV-hyperimmune globulin and CMV-negative blood products have been applied routinely for 2 years. MTX was used as prophylaxis against GvHD. In the prognostically unfavorable group of acute leukemia in relapse, only one patient showed long-term survival. In this patient, leukemic relapse occurred 6 years after transplantation. The survival rate of AML patients grafted during the first remission is 55% (16/29) with a median observation time of 41 months. For patients grafted in first or consecutive remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the survival rate is 50% (7/14) with a maximal observation time of 34 months. The overall incidence of GvHD in patients at risk was 28% in aplastic anemia, 26% in AML, 9% in ALL, and 63% in CML. In aplastic anemia, no patient developed an interstitial pneumonia.

In addition, an attempt was also made to induce and/or correct maturation of T cells in CLL patients by in vitro incubation with alpha 1 thymosin. In CLL patients and controls, we determined the percentage of T and B cells with T11, T8, T4, C3, and mouse erythrocyte (ME) receptors, along with T-cell functional reactivity (measured by local xenogeneic graft vs host reaction), before and after incubation with alpha 1 thymosin. In about 60% of stable CLL patients, and in 80% of those in the progressive phase of disease, T cells possess receptors for ME and/or C3. After incubation with alpha 1 thymosin, separate analysis of surface markers on T and B cells revealed (along with the induction of T11 receptors on T-cell surface) induction of ME receptors on T and B cells in stable phase and selective loss of ME receptors on B cells in the progressive phase of CLL. After incubation of normal lymphocytes with alpha 1 thymosin, we observed an increase of T8 receptors, no change in expression of T11, and a decrease of T4 receptors along with the increase of the intensity of T-cell functional reactivity. In contrast, in CLL patients following incubation with alpha 1 thymosin, the induction of T8 receptors was less prominent in the progressive than in the stable phase of disease. Furthermore, induction of T8 receptors in CLL patients in the stable phase was accompanied by recovery of impaired or increase of preserved functional T-cell reactivity.

It appears that when trisomy-12 is accompanied by yet another abnormality, the prognosis of patients is uniformly poor. Patients in early stages of CLL retain delayed hypersensitivity reactivity, while those in advanced stages are usually anergic. The lymphocytes from venous blood of patients with CLL appear to retain at least some ability to respond to stimulation with mitogens in early stages, whereas in advanced stages they show no response to mitogens. Serum immunoglobulin levels are normal in the early (0 and I) stages, are markedly decreased in the advanced (III and IV) stages, and are somewhat between these extremes in the intermediate (II) stage of CLL. Prolymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytoid transformation of CLL are indicators of poor prognosis, while a morphological variant characterized by large granular lymphocyte is associated with good prognosis.

We recently found that formation of 52- and 30-kilodalton (kD) glucocorticoid receptor fragments in cytosol of leukemia cells is due to proteolysis and is blocked by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). In the present study, we identify a 28-kD serine protease in cytosol of leukemia cells that binds [3H]DFP and correlates with the formation of 52- and 30-kD receptor fragments. This protease is immunoprecipitated by antiserum to neutrophil elastase. Limited digestion of [3H]dexamethasone-21-mesylate-labeled receptors by purified neutrophil elastase produces 52- and 30-kD receptor fragments. Receptor fragmentation in the cytosol of leukemia cells in inhibited by methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-chloromethylketone, a highly specific inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. The addition of as few as 5% neutrophils to a lymphoid cell suspension provides sufficient elastase to produce receptor fragmentation. Our findings indicate that neutrophil elastase is responsible for receptor fragmentation in the cytosol of leukemia cells.

We studied the effects of various chemical agents and serum-free culture (SF-C) condition on its differentiation. The KU-812-F subclone differentiated into macrophage-like cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but not with other agents. Unexpectedly, under SF-C, KU-812-F cells differentiated into mature basophil-like cells, and the histamine content of cell lysates increased in proportion to maturation. The addition of the condensed supernatant of SF-C promoted the cloning efficiency of KU-812-F cells in semisolid SF-C, whereas the cloning efficiency was reduced in SF-C alone. KU-812-F cells expressed myelomonocytic antigens. Additionally, My4 was induced with PMA and SF-C, but less often. HLA-DR was not expressed in any culture conditions, despite blastic morphology of KU-812-F cells or macrophage-like cells induced with PMA. The IgE receptor could not be demonstrated under any conditions. Correspondingly, immature and mature KU-812-F cells did not respond to anti-IgE or concanavalin A (con A), while histamine release was induced with PMA. In conclusion, KU-812-F belongs to the myeloid cell lineage and is at least a bipotential cell that can differentiate into basophils and macrophage-like cells. Although the functions appear to be dissimilar to those of normal basophils, the KU-812-F cell line may be a good model for basophil differentiation. Moreover, KU-812-F cells may provide new insights because they grow in semisolid culture by an autostimulating mechanism.",,,['820484N8I3 (Histamine)'],['S0006-4971(20)78642-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to test whether combined measurements of various cellular markers such as beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m), lactoferrin (LF) and lysozyme (LYS) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) might aid in the diagnosis of CNS involvement in such patients. Forty-two patients were studied. Sixteen were considered to have CNS involvement and 26 showed no signs of such involvement. In the group with symptoms or signs of CNS involvement, nine patients out of 12 had increased total protein in CSF, 14 of 14 increased beta 2m, 14 of 16 increased LYS and five of 15 increased LF. In patients without CNS involvement total protein was increased in four of 25, beta 2m in three of 21, LYS in four of 28 and LF in one of 28 patients. The differences were statistically significant (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05, respectively). Prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate treatment in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia caused an increase in the CSF of beta 2m, LYS and LF but not of total protein, which may reflect a drug-induced inflammatory reaction in the CNS.

The recipients (female) were given whole-body irradiation with 7 or 8 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays, while the donors (male) were given whole-body irradiation with 3, 1.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays. Each recipient was intravenously infused with 1-3 X 10(7) of the mixed marrow cells of donors. In the result, the average incidence of surviving over 1 month was 86% in the recipients. Myelocytic leukemia developed in all the transplanted groups, the average incidence being 88.5%. Leukemia was observed in 1.5-2.5 months after transplantation in the recipients receiving marrow cells from donors exposed to 3 Gy, but in 5-8 months in other groups. It was demonstrated by the analysis of Y-chromosome that the leukemic cells were derived from the donor's marrow cells. The results suggest that marrow transplantation for the mice irradiated by Co-60 gamma-rays of lethal dose can protect them from death, but promote the development of leukemia. Radiation can induce production of factors which lead to leukemic transformation of engrafted normal marrow cells in the irradiated mice; the direct damage of DNA caused by radiation is not the unique factor that gives rise to leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reflecting the complex clinical, biological, physical and technical situation of TBI, a large variety of TBI treatment techniques has been developed. In order to review the techniques applied in Europe and to report about common methods as well as about new ideas in TBI, a questionnaire was prepared and mailed to medical physicists in Europe responsible for TBI. The topics of this questionnaire are general information: TBI technique (beams, fields, treatment conditions); basic TBI dosimetry; physical treatment planning (patient dosimetry, heterogeneity correction, dose modification, dose homogeneity, dose precision, confirmation measurements); TBI treatment planning (dose prescription, localization, documentation, verification, in vivo dosimetry); requirements (additional staff, time, equipment) and recommendations for improvement of TBI. Most questionnaires (34/45) were returned in time with detailed information from TBI centres in 15 European countries. These data as well as results of the ""Meeting of Leiden, 1982"" of the ""Meeting of Essen, 1985"" and of the ""Meeting of Toulouse, 1986"" are summarized and discussed. There are many interesting methods to plan and perform exact TBI. However, anterior-posterior TBI is preferred to achieve sufficient homogeneity of dose and effective lung shielding.

After a single session treatment (10 Gy in 4 h) the most dramatic variation was observed in the granulocytes. At the end of the irradiation their concentration was 2 to 6 times higher. Because of a subsequent rapid decline, the peak may be overlooked if the blood counts are delayed. Lymphocytes decreased to 50% at the end of the single session TBI and continue to decrease exponentially, with a half time of 30 h. During a fractionated irradiation (11 X 1.2 Gy in 4 days) the lymphocyte number dropped to 60%, 13 h after the first fraction and this decline continued with a half time of 30 h during the treatment. From the data obtained in vivo, a lymphocyte D0 value of 1.2 Gy was computed. The lymphocyte subsets (B.T. OKT4 OKT8) did not exhibit different radiosensitivities either in vivo or in vitro. The disappearance of lethally hit lymphocytes from the blood exhibits a biphasic kinetic: 50% of the cells disappear in a few hours and 50% with a half time at 30 h. Lymphocytes irradiated either in vitro or in vivo when in culture disappear slowly, contrasting with the in vivo findings.

(1) The experience with experimental tumors suggests that MC540-mediated photolysis is effective against a broad range of leukemias and solid tumors, including drug-resistant tumors (Sieber et al., 1984b). Drug-resistant tumor cells are likely to occur in heavily pretreated patients. (2) MC540-mediated photolysis is not cell-cycle dependent (Manna and Sieber, 1985). It kills both resting and cycling cells. In this regard, MC540-mediated photolysis is a valuable complement to cell-cycle specific cytotoxic drugs. (3) There is a large differential in sensitivity between normal pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia and neuroblastoma cells. (4) The mechanism of action of MC540-mediated photolysis is different from that of lectins, antibodies and most cytotoxic drugs. MC540 binds to the lipid portion of the plasma membrane and membrane lipids are probably a primary target of the toxic photoproducts. Antibodies and lectins react with proteins and carbohydrates and most drugs have intracellular targets (e.g., nuclear DNA). We would therefore expect little cross-resistance if MC540-mediated photolysis were used in combination with other purging procedures.(5) The small amounts of dye that remain associated with the marrow graft and are infused into the patient are approximately 100,000-fold less than the LD(10) (in mice) and therefore unlikely to cause any harm. The outcome of the first clinical application of the technique supports this view (Sieber et al., 1986c). A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms will undoubtedly lead to more effective applications of the technique and perhaps to the identification of more potent analogs of MC540.",,['CA 42734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1987.tb04738.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook this study to compare autologous and allogeneic marrow transplantation in the treatment of such cases. We treated 91 patients with high-dose chemoradiotherapy and followed them for 1.4 to 5 years. Forty-six patients with an HLA-matched donor received allogeneic marrow, and 45 patients without a matched donor received their own marrow taken during remission and purged of leukemic cells with use of monoclonal antibodies. Bone marrow engraftment occurred earlier in patients who received autologous marrow. Recipients of autologous marrow had shorter hospital courses, with significantly fewer peritransplantation deaths than recipients of allogeneic marrow. Post-transplantation relapse of leukemia was the most frequent cause of treatment failure; relapses occurred in an estimated 37 percent of patients with allogeneic grafts in whom graft-versus-host disease developed, 75 percent of patients with allogeneic grafts in whom graft-versus-host disease did not develop, and 79 percent of patients who received autologous grafts. The interval before relapse was significantly shorter in the autologous-marrow group than in the allogeneic-marrow group.

We have previously shown that a significant proportion of these clones have unique rearrangements in their cellular p53 oncogene. The clonal relationships among Friend tumor cells isolated in the late stages of Friend erythroleukemia were analyzed by examining the unique integration site of Friend murine leukemia virus and the unique rearrangement in their cellular p53 oncogene. The majority of clones isolated from individual mice infected with Friend virus were clonally related as judged by the site of Friend murine leukemia virus integration. However, Southern gel analysis of DNA from individual Friend cell clones indicated that all of the clones with a normal p53 gene from the same mice were clonally related, but were unrelated to the Friend cell lines with a rearranged p53 gene. These results suggest that Friend tumor cells with rearrangements in their p53 gene arise as the result of a unique transformation event, rather than by progression from already existing tumor cells with a normal p53 gene.

Within cells they are transferred to and accumulate in nuclei by a temperature-dependent process. In this study, the authors analyzed and compared subnuclear distribution and binding of these PGs. Nuclei accumulating either [3H]PGA2 or [3H] delta 12-PGJ2 were extracted successively with a hypotonic solution and with a 1% Triton X-100 solution, and the radioactivities in the two extracts (fractions of nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane, respectively) and the remaining residues (a fraction of chromatin and nuclear matrix) were determined. About three-fourths of PGA2-derived nuclear radioactivity was found in the extracts, and only 20% in the residues. Most of the radioactivity in the extracts was recovered in ethyl acetate under acidic conditions and identified as intact PGA2, suggesting that the majority of PGA2 in nuclei was present as free molecules. On the other hand, more than 70% of delta 12-PGJ2-derived nuclear radioactivity was associated with the residues and resistant to extraction with acidic ethyl acetate. This radioactivity, however, became extractable after brief alkali treatment and was identified as intact delta 12-PGJ2. In order to identify nuclear component binding of this PG, the authors digested the residues with either DNases or proteases. The radioactivity in the residues was almost completely released by digestion with proteases and clearly separated from DNA by ethanol precipitation. These results suggested that most of nuclear delta 12-PGJ2 bound covalently to protein(s) of chromatin and nuclear matrix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Prostaglandins D)', '87893-54-7 (9-deoxy-9,10-didehydro-12,13-didehydro-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin D2)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'K6VT5BDY9E (prostaglandin A2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that activation of B cells by mitogens (anti-immunoglobulin antibody, lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/A23187) was associated with a rapid and prominent (5-20-fold) increase in the synthesis of a 40-kDa/pI 5.0 nuclear protein, here termed numatrin. Numatrin was found to be absent from the cytosol (soluble fraction) of resting as well as activated B cells and was markedly resistant to DNase/RNase digestion and 2 N NaCl extraction, indicating that this protein is tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. Kinetic studies showed that the increase in synthesis of numatrin was detected 60-120 min following mitogen activation, reached a peak at 16 h, and declined to almost control level by 48 h, correlating with the peak of cellular DNA synthesis. The increase in synthesis of numatrin in normal B cells was found to be associated exclusively with cellular commitment for mitogenesis because activation of B cells by stimuli such as B cell stimulating factor 1, PMA alone, and calcium ionophore A23187, which do not stimulate an increase in DNA synthesis, also failed to induce an increase in the synthesis of numatrin. Inhibition of anti-Ig-induced proliferation (by PMA pretreatment) was associated with a 63% inhibition in the synthesis of numatrin. Addition of 8-mercaptoguanosine to these PMA-treated cells was associated with restoration of the increase in synthesis of numatrin, concomitant with induction of proliferation. Elevated synthesis of numatrin was also detected in the malignant B lymphoma cells: Raji, BAL-17, and WEHI-231. Taken collectively, these results suggest that numatrin, a tightly bound nuclear matrix protein, is a growth-regulated protein which might have an important role in regulation of cellular mitogenesis in normal and malignant B lymphocytes.",,['R01 AI21328-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['S0021-9258(18)60972-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,

When donor and recipient are of unlike sex, the sex chromosomes serve as a useful marker to determine cellular origin. When donor and recipient are of like sex, autosomal heteromorphisms can be used to identify the origin of cells in metaphase. Using Q-banding, we found that 17 of 20 patient/donor pairs (85%) examined showed at least one chromosome heteromorphism that distinguished between recipient and donor cells with certainty. Five of the patients were followed up after BMT in order to document engraftment. Donor metaphases could be detected in the marrow within two weeks of BMT when the graft was successful. Chimaerism was detected in the lymphocyte population even when the graft persisted.

A large number of megakaryocytes, representing 20%-60% of total cells cultured, developed after 12-14 days in liquid cultures supplemented with human plasma, while fetal calf serum supported the development of cells of the megakaryocytic lineage poorly. Ploidy studies showed the presence of 8N and 16N cells in human plasma-supplemented cultures while very few cells with DNA content greater than 4N were found in those supplemented with fetal calf serum. Using the FACS IV cytofluorometer, 1-2 X 10(6) megakaryocytes/h were sorted after immunolabeling of the human plasma-cultured cells with a monoclonal antibody reacting against the platelet glycoprotein complex IIb-IIIa.

Using purified human mononuclear cells, the intracellular change in concentrations of GTP and pterins was measured under various kinds of stimulation. Three enzymes involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, i.e. GTP cyclohydrolase I, 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase, were also determined. Human macrophages stimulated with culture supernatant from activated T-lymphocytes were the main producers of neopterin. In these cells, GTP cyclohydrolase I activity was elevated due to high GTP levels and therefore neopterin accumulated. Human macrophages lack 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase activity. Exogenous tetrahydrobiopterin added to the culture medium of stimulated T cells and macrophages suppressed the elevation of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity and neopterin concentration, but not the elevation of intracellular GTP. Stimulation of macrophages with recombinant human interferon-gamma and neutralization of the effect of T cell supernatants by addition of a monoclonal antibody specific for human interferon-gamma showed that immune interferon induced the alterations in GTP cyclohydrolase I activity and neopterin concentration. In the human macrophage line U-937 and in the leukemia line HL-60, no GTP cyclohydrolase I activity or intracellular pterins were detected, but high levels of GTP. In mouse mononuclear cells, no neopterin was detected, but biopterin and pterin. After stimulation, biopterin was elevated in the same way as neopterin in human mononuclear cells. This is explained by the different regulation of the rate-limiting steps of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis in man and in mouse. These results suggest that neopterin is an unspecific marker for the activation of the cellular immune system.",,,"['0 (Pterins)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.153 (sepiapterin reductase)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)', 'EC 4.6.- (Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.6.10 (6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase)']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1987.tb13515.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Before therapy a uniform hairy cell infiltrate was present and very little tissue was visible even after immunohistochemical staining. During therapy, identification of hairy cells in routine biopsies was difficult, since they were mixed with normal cells and the bone marrow was generally hypoplastic. Immunohistochemical stains seem to allow better identification of hairy cells and a more precise estimate of the degree of repopulation by normal bone marrow cells.

First, T cell receptor and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis as a means of immunomolecular marking was carried out. Second, a double immunoenzymatic staining technique for determining the surface phenotypes of proliferating lymphocytes using a monoclonal antibody against DNA polymerase alpha together with those detecting lymphocyte membrane antigens was developed.

In this study, a sensitive immunoalkaline phosphatase procedure (the APAAP technic) has been used to stain normal and neoplastic blood and bone marrow samples for TdT with the use of both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-TdT antibodies. As expected, most cases of ALL studied (63 of 65) were TdT-positive. In addition, however, blast cells in 22 out of 59 (37%) cases of AML were stained by anti-TdT antibodies. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization were seen in each type of acute leukemia.

Twelve patients had high-risk acute leukemias, and five had chronic myelogenous leukemia. No other graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was used. A mixture of three anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies conjugated to ricin were used in this study: TA-1, UCHT-1 (anti-CD3), and T101 (anti-CD5). The mean number of bone marrow cells infused was 1.5 X 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg recipient weight. Thirteen of the 17 patients demonstrated complete and sustained engraftment. Four patients experienced autologous marrow recovery and/or graft rejection. Compared with an historical group of leukemic patients who received GVHD prophylaxis with methotrexate alone or combinations of methotrexate, and prednisone plus antithymocyte globulin, (ATG) or OKT3, the IT patients with stable engraftment demonstrated shorter time to recovery of leukocytes greater than or equal to 1000mm3 for three consecutive days (median, 20 days vs. 26 days, P = .03). The recovery of total lymphocytes, B and T cell subsets, and T cell function by day 28 was highly variable, but similar, for patients in both the IT-treated group and historical controls. Four patients (ages 13, 18, 21, and 38) developed grade II skin GVHD, but none had severe GVHD. Eight of the 13 patients with durable engraftment have had posttransplant leukemic relapse. Currently only four patients remain alive; two have not relapsed posttransplant, while the other two achieved remission following posttransplant relapse. We conclude that severe GVHD was not observed in this small series with ex vivo T cell depletion for GVHD prophylaxis, and that favorable recovery of hematologic and lymphocytic function was demonstrated for cases where primary engraftment was sustained. A larger randomized controlled study will be needed to establish whether T cell depletion of donor bone marrow with IT can significantly reduce GVHD, and/or improve disease-free survival.",,"['CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PA-P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",['10.1097/00007890-198707000-00015 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the alternatively spliced transcript, erg 2, was found to differ from erg 1 by a splicing event that causes a coding frameshift near the amino terminus, resulting in an additional 99-amino acid insertion at the amino-terminus. Expression of complementary DNAs for the two transcripts in vitro resulted in synthesis of polypeptides of approximately 41 and 52 kilodaltons, suggesting the use of alternative translation initiation codons in the case of erg proteins.

However, neither thymic nor other types of leukemias were induced in these rats. In the following experiment, thymectomized male rats received grafts sc with normal thymuses of age-matched female F344 rats. Continuous administration of NPU to the rats successfully induced 9 thymic lymphomas in the grafted thymuses. In 8 thymic lymphomas analyzed, 6 consisted of donor cells and the other 2 consisted of recipient cells.

At this standpoint it is important to review the recent literature which concerns etiology of leukemia. Recently it has been proved that of the incidence of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia is same in all over the world by Greaves and his collegue. So the major cause of childhood leukemia can be explained to be spontaneous mutation. Nevertheless genetic factors are thought to be a part of another cause of leukemia as well as certain environmental factors.

In a prior Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial, oral cyclophosphamide, given as a single agent, was found to be equivalent to a five-drug regimen in remission induction in patients with follicular NHL who had not received prior chemotherapy. Recently, interferon alfa-2b (Intron A; Schering Plough) has been demonstrated to elicit complete or partial responses in up to 50% of patients with nodular NHL who had received prior chemotherapy. In the current CALGB pilot trial, oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2 daily) combined with interferon alfa-2b (2 X 10(6) IU/m2 s.c. on alternate days) is being evaluated, both in previously treated and untreated patients with stage III or IV follicular NHL, for toxicity, safety and efficacy in remission induction. A total of 68 patients have been entered into this study. Four patients are ineligible on pathology review, and 60 have on-study data currently available. Forty-one (60%) had not received prior chemotherapy and 19 (32%) had previously received some form of chemotherapy. Leukopenia was found to be the single, most common toxicity experienced by all patients. Previously untreated patients experienced leukopenia of less than 2,000 WBC/microliter at a significantly higher rate (53% versus 14%) than a similar patient population receiving oral cyclophosphamide as a single agent in the prior CALGB trial.

In the former, prolactin was shown to be a powerful promoter regardless of the initiating agent. Prolactin was also found to be useful in detecting the carcinogenicity of the small doses of carcinogens; a high r.b.e. of 2.0 MeV fission spectrum neutrons was demonstrated by the application of prolactin to radiation-initiated mammary carcinogenesis in rats. In the latter, total-body irradiation involving both bone marrow and thymus facilitates chemically-initiated T-cell lymphomagenesis in mice. This could be attributed to the amplification of the cell population susceptible to a chemical carcinogen in the target tissue during the recovery phase after irradiation. The dual effect of a carcinogen, acting in the different phases of carcinogenesis was suggested by the split administration of N-nitrosoethylurea (NEU) in the induction of T-cell lymphomas.

The two groups of rats that were treated with Cy (Cy and Cy + TBI) that survived beyond 100 days after treatment, had a severely decreased median (post treatment) survival time (Cy + TBI: 14.5 months and Cy: 14.1 months). Survival time in the TBI group was moderately decreased (18.5 months) as compared with the untreated controls (27.2 months). All treatment modalities were carcinogenic according to the raw data. After Cy-treatment a high incidence of, frequently multiple, malignant nerve-sheath tumours (Cy: 66 per cent, Cy + TBI: 31 per cent, controls: 2 per cent) was observed. TBI induced an increased occurrence of a great variety of tumours, especially mesenchymal tumours. This effect was more pronounced in animals receiving TBI alone as compared to animals receiving the combined treatment of Cy + TBI; an effect that most likely resulted from the longer median survival after TBI. The multi-target effect of TBI was also reflected in the occurrence of nonneoplastic effects in a variety of tissues, including high incidences of biliary cysts in the liver and severe testicular atrophy. The most important Cy-induced nonneoplastic lesion was incisor dysplasia, which resulted in feeding problems that could only be partly overcome by administering powdered food. Early mortality in the Cy-treated groups was associated with emaciation and generalized organ atrophy.

Enhanced activity reached a peak at 7-14 days postinjection of the C. parvum and then gradually returned to normal levels by 20-25 days postinjection. Increased plasma proteinase activity could be induced by C. parvum whole cells or the pyridine extract residue of C. parvum but not by BCG or the pyridine extract of C. parvum. BCG did not interfere with the induction of elevated levels of activity by C. parvum. Splenectomized animals responded the same as normal mice indicating that the splenomegaly accompanying the onset of increased plasma proteinase activity was not responsible for the changes. Administration of C. parvum via a subcutaneous site rather than intraperitoneally failed to induce systemic changes in proteinase activity while still inducing splenomegaly. Treatment of animals with C. parvum before or after transplantation of the BCL1 leukemia or the B16-F10 melanoma failed to alter the course of the disease or enhance the increased proteinase activity of plasma over that observed in plasma from animals bearing tumors alone. These observations support the hypothesis that the induction of disturbances in plasma proteinase activity in tumor-bearing animals is due to alterations in host systems and that C. parvum, in contrast to BCG, contains components which can mimic the effect of some tumors on host systems.",,,['EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)'],['10.1159/000215562 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety percent of the cases of AML reacted with one or more of the pan-myeloid MoAb, My7, My9, or 20.3. Reactivity of the myeloid panel of MoAb showed some correlation with the French-American-British (FAB) classification of AML. Five of six cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were HLA-DR negative; the one HLA-DR-positive APL had a minor population of HLA-DR-negative promyelocytes. OKM5 and/or My4 reacted with 16 of 16 monocytic leukemias. No specific marker of early erythroid development was identified. AP3, a MoAb reactive with platelet glycoprotein (GPIIIa), was specific for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

Two cases of AML had minor populations of blasts detected by the APAAP technique that were immunologically distinct from the major blast population; these minor populations emerged as the predominant cell type at relapse. Two cases of ALL expressed multiple myeloid and lymphoid antigens. Two other cases that morphologically were ALL reacted with only myeloid MoAb; one consisted entirely of immature basophils on ultrastructural examination.

Attempts to remove the leukocytes from the platelet concentrates by additional centrifugation steps led to substantial loss of platelets. We report a new procedure for removal of almost all leukocytes with excellent platelet recoveries. Single donor concentrates are treated with 50 ng/mL prostacyclin to inactivate the platelets transiently. The concentrates are then passed through a cellulose-acetate filter to remove the leukocytes. In 30 concentrates this treatment reduced the contamination by leukocytes to less than 0.1 million per concentrate with a platelet recovery of 89% +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM). Thirty filtered platelet concentrates transfused to ten thrombocytopenic patients within one hour after filtration were well tolerated and led to corrected count increments of (22.0 +/- 1.1) X 10(6)/mL blood after one hour and normal survival thereafter. In four of five patients these concentrates reduced the bleeding time.

The timing of BMT was found to be very important for the survival of patients. In cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, if BMT was performed in the first remission, the long survival rate was 76%, while this rate was low for second or subsequent remissions.

Using Cox's proportional hazard regression model, it was indicated that the status of the disease and clinical condition at the time of BMT as well as supportive treatment had a great impact on survival after BMT for acute leukemia. On the basis of the clinical condition at the time of BMT, 2-year survivals were 57% and 16% for patients in remission without infection and the remaining patients, respectively (p = 0.0001). Nonremission at the time of BMT (p = 0.0138), advanced age (p = 0.0115) and increased number of platelet transfusions (p = 0.0351) were found to be significant risk factors associated with IP, while TBI was also one of the most important factors in the development of IP. Two-year probabilities of developing IP were 81% and 49% in single-dose TBI and in fractionated TBI, respectively (p = 0.0002). In the single-dose TBI group, a dose rate of less than 5 cGy/min resulted in a low incidence of IP. In the fractionated TBI group, the incidence of IP was somewhat low in the 6-fraction group. According to my own experience, 4-field TBI of 12 Gy/6 frx/3 days with a carefully monitored lung dose of 8 Gy in total resulted in significant improvement in BMT for leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of approaches of cancer diagnosis and therapy with monoclonal antibodies and cytokines in Japan were introduced in this paper, and problems of these trials to be solved in the future were discussed. Together with almost established surgical treatment, chemotherapy and physicotherapy, including radiation and hyperthermia, biotherapy, including immunotherapy and therapy with hormones and various biological response modifiers (BRM) are required for the purpose of complete cure of cancer.

Bone marrow aspirates taken before and longitudinally after BMT were investigated for pre-B and B cells by immunofluorescence techniques; in some cases, TdT+ cells were also determined. Normal values were derived from bone marrow samples taken from 23 healthy individuals who served as bone marrow donors. In normal bone marrow, B cells outnumber pre-B cells and the latter are more numerous than TdT+ cells. Before BMT, the numbers of BM pre-B were outside the normal range in all cases; B cell numbers were abnormal in most of the 11 patients studied, probably due to the antileukemic remission induction/consolidation therapy. After BMT, two distinct patterns of regeneration of the B cell system were observed. In 9 patients, TdT+ cells were considerably increased early after BMT. This was followed by a rise in pre-B cells, with values well above the normal range, and resulting in ratios of TdT+:pre-B cells and of pre-B cells:B cells that were transiently greater than 1. In the other 6 patients, the regeneration of TdT+ cells varied and the reconstitution of the pre-B cells was more gradual than in the first group, with pre-B-to-B cell ratios less than 1 during the whole observation period. The only consistent difference between the patients of the two groups, possibly relevant to the regeneration of the B cell lineage, was the duration of corticosteroid therapy, which was much longer in the 6 patients with slow-pace reconstitution. The pace of regeneration of the B cell system in the bone marrow was correlated with the recovery of the humoral immunity, as indicated by a significant increase in specific antibody titers after the second vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-poliomyelitis vaccine in 7 of 9 patients in the rapid-pace group, versus 2 of 6 patients in the slow-pace group.",,,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In conjunction with anecdotal clinical reports of this synergism, multiple clinical trials were initiated to determine the tolerance and toxicity of the alfa interferons in conjunction with other antineoplastic agents/modalities. Phase I-II studies have been completed with alfa interferon and melphalan/prednisone, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide (VP-16), cyclophosphamide, and radiation. In general, it may be stated that the toxicities are nonoverlapping and not unexpected. The tolerable doses of the interferons (IFNs) have generally been low. The future of research with interferon may be divided into three areas: Efforts must be made to determine how best to translate the in vitro synergy into clinically meaningful terms; in order to exploit the fullest potential of IFN, research is moving toward using this agent earlier in disease either as an adjuvant after tumor debulking or after initial diagnosis; the medical community must rethink the natural history of some diseases, because the fullest potential of the biologic agents will most likely manifest itself when these agents are used together.",,,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

With over 5,000 patients now treated with these compounds, some general principles have emerged that have wider implications for phase I-II strategies for testing other biologicals. There is a suggestion of dose-response relationships and a clearer picture of schedule dependence. The extent of tumor burden and identification of sensitive subtypes of patients also appear to be critical factors in evaluating the true potential activity of biological compounds. The toxicity profile of the alpha interferons is unusual. Fever and flu-like symptoms occur in all doses and schedules and are usually dose limiting. Somnolence and other CNS effects occur in a small percentage of patients. Hematologic toxicity occurs but is minimal at lower doses and is noncumulative and rapidly reversible at all doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity is mild. No other unusual or unexpected toxicities have been reported, and early reports of cardiovascular toxicity have not been confirmed in large trials. The use of these pioneer recombinant DNA products raised concerns about the potential development of antibodies and serum-neutralizing factors. Reports with small patient numbers confirmed the occasional development of serum-neutralizing activity to some alpha interferons. The significance of this neutralizing activity and the reasons for an apparent higher incidence of this phenomenon with some alpha interferon preparations remain to be determined. The full role of alpha interferon by itself or in combination with other available therapies will be resolved in coming years.

All patients were splenectomized before BMT. To prevent graft versus host disease Cyclosporin alone or associated with Methotrexate was given; in addition 13 patients received a T cell depleted marrow. All patients showed engraftment. Of the 5 patients treated by syngenic BMT, 2 patients relapsed but all are alive in remission, 2 of them after a successful second BMT. Of the 36 patients treated by allogeneic BMT in the chronic phase, 20 are alive in unmaintained remission after a median follow-up of 24 months (range 6 to 58). No patients have relapsed. The actuarial survival at 2 years was 60%. Of the 29 patients with more advanced disease, 19 have survived with the actuarial survival at 2 years 50%. We conclude that the probability of cure after BMT is very high, especially if BMT is performed while the patient remains in the chronic phase.

Nutritional support, provided at approximately 30 nonprotein calories/kg and 0.21 g nitrogen/kg ideal weight, did not differ between groups. Despite greater nitrogen loss and muscle breakdown evidenced by increased 3-methylhistidine-to-creatinine ratio and loss of arm muscle area by study end in the 45% BCAA, no statistical differences were observed when nitrogen balance was compared by week and within stress level as defined by organ and infectious complications. It is likely the patients in the 45% BCAA experienced greater metabolic stress by study end. Serum prealbumin and day posttransplant to peripheral engraftment also did not differ between groups. The chances (power) of this study exceeded 85% in detecting a difference in nitrogen balance of 2.5 g during study week 1 and 4.0 g during week 2.

With b or c activation is rapid (less than 10 s), but with a the process is much slower; at 25 degrees C, pseudo first-order rate constants for activation by excess pCMB or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) are 0.45 and 0.08 min-1, respectively. Activation can also be monitored by conformational changes in the protein as indicated by enhanced fluorescence of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate or by increased intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues in the enzyme. Pseudo first-order rate constants for the pCMB-induced conformational change, measured by these fluorimetric procedures (0.45 min-1 and about 0.4 min-1, respectively), are in good agreement with the value obtained from the increase in catalytic activity. The rate of modification of the single cysteine residue in the enzyme by excess 14C-labeled pCMB, however, is faster than the rate of activation, indicating that the conformational change follows derivatization and is the rate-limiting step in the overall process.

Dose compensating and the shielding of contour variations, inhomogeneities, and the critical organs, as well as in vivo dosimetry were undertaken in more than half of the hospitals.

We report here the isolation and nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding nuclear products of mol. wt 58, 60, 62 and 64 kd, indistinguishable from those detected in chicken cells. The p60 and p64 species appear to represent phosphorylated versions on serine and threonine residues of p58 and p62. The homology of p58-64 to other ets-related proteins, including the v-ets encoded domain of the transforming protein of avian leukemia virus E26 and p54c-ets, the translation product of the chicken (Ck) c-ets gene, is confined to two regions of 175 and 96 amino acid residues localized respectively at the carboxy-terminal domain and close to the amino-terminal domain of these molecules. This cDNA corresponds to a gene localized in a locus distinct from that of c-ets which is transcribed as a 4.0-kb RNA species in most chicken tissues. We also identified the human (Hu) c-ets-2-encoded products as two proteins of 60 and 62 kd, highly related to chicken p58-64. This, together with the fact that the amino acid sequence of the cDNA encoding p58-64 is 95% identical to the reported partial sequence of a Hu-c-ets-2 cDNA, indicates that p58-64 are the translation products of the Ck-c-ets-2 gene.","['INSERM U 186/CNRS UA 041160, Institut Pasteur, Lille, France.']",,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,PMC454376,['GENBANK/X07202'],,,,,,

In one chimeric case, peripheral blood T lymphocytes were of donor origin, and B lymphocytes were of host origin. Mononuclear cells in the bone marrow were of host HLA type.

The plasma cells around neoplastic nodules contained the same monoclonal immunoglobulins as those in the nodules in two cases. In the remainder, most plasma cells around the nodules possessed the same immunoglobulins as those in the nodules. The authors consider these plasma cells to be the cause of paraproteinemia.

The most frequent risk factors are the intensity and duration of leucopaenia, cytotoxic drugs and steroid therapy. In the respiratory tract, the proliferation of Aspergillus fumigatus becomes possible when there is a failure of the reticulo-endothelial system and of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes. There is no typical clinical picture: one sees an acute febrile pneumonia resistant to antibiotics. However, the radiological signs are more suggestive with nodules and bilateral infiltrates with a tendency to cavity formation and sequestration. The prognosis is clinically linked to the rapidity of diagnosis. Broncho-alveolar lavage offers a new and non-invasive diagnostic method to search for Aspergillus mycelia or specific antigens. A direct examination and culture of sputum expectoration are both insensitive and non-specific but remain useful in some patients with leukaemia in a phase of agranulocytosis.

Likewise, these spleen cell populations failed to respond following mitogenic stimulation or exogenous addition of recombinant IL-2. By contrast, the FLV-infected spleen cell populations produced normal levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and thymocytes from FLV-infected mice responded normally to addition of exogenous IL-1. This suggests that FLV infection selectively affects the ability of spleen cells to produce cytokines. Spleen cell populations enriched for T lymphocytes and depleted of tumor cells by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll were unable to produce IL-2. This indicates that the failure to detect IL-2 in cells from FLV-infected mice was not due to a dilution of T lymphocytes by tumor cells but was a functional inability to produce IL-2. Furthermore, enriched T lymphocytes from FLV-infected mice failed to respond blastogenically to exogenous IL-2. Additional studies indicate that tumor cells, but not macrophages or T lymphocytes from FLV-infected spleens, suppressed the blastogenic response to mitogens and IL-2 production by normal splenic T lymphocytes.","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida, College of Medicine, Tampa 33612.']",,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",['10.3181/00379727-188-42746 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients were male, 4 female; ages ranged from 28 to 82 years. Ten of 13 patients presented with cutaneous vasculitis antedating malignancy by an average of 10 months. Three of 13 developed cutaneous vasculitis after malignancy. A statistically significant association between cutaneous vasculitis and lympho- or myeloproliferative malignancies was noted when compared with all other tumors. Dermatologic manifestations included palpable purpura (5 patients), maculopapular eruptions (4), urticarial and petechial lesions (3), and ulcers (1). Hepatitis B surface antigen, Coombs antibodies, rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies were not found. Serum cryoglobulins were detected in 3 patients; serum C3 and C4 were normal in 8 of 9 patients evaluated. Histologic examinations revealed necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with disruption of endothelial integrity, destruction of endothelium, and neutrophil infiltration. Occasional perivascular mononuclear cell invasion was also noted in 4 patients. Immunofluorescent staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 was negative in all patients studied. Symptoms were, in general, poorly responsive to therapy, which included nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antihistamines, antiserotonin agents, and corticosteroids. Chemotherapy directed at the underlying malignancy was also generally ineffective, although the vasculitis appeared to lessen in severity. Vasculitis appeared to lessen in severity as bone marrow function deteriorated. Ten patients died, all as a direct result of their malignancy. We have described a unique clinical syndrome of lympho- and myeloproliferative disease presenting with small-vessel vasculitis.

Fifty-eight patients (85%) entered complete remission after treatment with etoposide (VP-16)/cytarabine (ara-C) (A), followed by daunorubicin (Dauno)/ara-C/thioguanine (6-TG) (B) and then VP-16/azacytidine (5-AZ) (C). Thirty percent of the complete responders, mainly those with an M4 or M5 leukemia subtype, attained M1 marrow status after component A, 60% after A + B, and 10% after A + B + C. Induction failures resulted primarily from absolute or relative drug resistance; there was only one death during this phase of therapy. Postremission treatment consisted of three pairs of drugs (vincristine [VCR]/amsacrine [m-AMSA], or doxorubicin [Doxo]/6-TG/ara-C, and VP-16/cyclophosphamide [CTX]) administered sequentially in 6-week cycles for 22 months. Despite the high rate of remission induction, only 33% +/- 7% SE of the patients are expected to be failure-free survivors at 2 years. Remission durations were not significantly affected by the majority of factors examined in this study, with the exception of marrow cellularity after VP-16/ara-C induction therapy. Patients with less than or equal to 5% leukemic cells survived relapse-free for a median of 36.1 months, compared with 11.3 months for the group with a larger infiltrate (P = .01). Although postremission therapy did not improve the percentage of long-term failure-free survivors, the induction regimen we used appears highly effective, and its components should be considered for inclusion in other treatment programs.","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],['10.1200/JCO.1988.6.7.1134 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In 14 patients with lymphomatous lesions fast MR showed circumscribed areas of low signal intensity at both pulse angles. The lesion-to-spleen contrast was better on images acquired with a pulse angle of 30 degrees. For fast MR with pulse angles of 30 degrees, the mean lesion-to-spleen contrast was similar to US and contrast-enhanced CT. However, with fast MR the contrast showed a lower variability and was considerably better than with unenhanced CT. In one patient fast MR showed splenic involvement that was missed on both CT and US. The signal characteristics of lymphomatous, leukemic, and sarcoid involvement and of healed infarcts were similar and indistinguishable on fast MR images. Recent splenic infarctions (three cases) were, however, distinctly different, characterized by regions of high signal intensity at both pulse angles.

Gangliosides isolated from T-ALL and non-T-ALL blasts by two different methods were separated by thin-layer chromatography and stained with anti-GD3 and a control antibody specific for GM3 and sialosylparagloboside (SPG). Anti-GD3 reactivity was observed in extracts from T-ALL cells in all cases, whereas GD3 was not detected in any of the non-T-ALL samples. The anti-GM3/SPG antibody stained GM3 in all of the leukemic samples analyzed as well as SPG in the non-T-ALL samples. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to assess the expression of GD3 at the surface of leukemic blasts. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with R24 showed that whereas T-ALL blasts were highly reactive with this antibody, non-T-ALL blasts were totally unreactive. In an analysis of a larger number of leukemia patients by fluorescence microscopy, 20 out of 28 samples with the T-ALL phenotype were positive for R24, whereas zero out of 11 non-T-ALL samples were reactive. These results confirm our earlier finding of the specificity of GD3 to the T-ALL subclass of childhood leukemias and furthermore suggest the potential value of anti-GD3 as an immunological tool for the diagnosis and therapy of T-cell ALL.","['Bacterial Toxins Branch, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['CA-03888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '62010-37-1 (ganglioside, GD3)']",['10.1002/jcb.240370103 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The study included four patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had died between 0.5 and 12 months after transplantation. The study yielded the following results: 1. All lymph nodes, irrespective of length of the survival period, exhibited severe atrophy of the lymphoreticular tissue with marked depletion of lymphocytes and dilatation of the sinuses. The number of lymphoid cells increased considerably with time after transplantation. 2. The main constituents of the recovering immune system were mature T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+ cells in nearly equal numbers) and macrophages. The earliest signs of recovery of the immune system could already be detected 0.5 month after BMT. 3. Extreme paucity of B lymphocytes was a prominent finding in all lymph nodes studied. True lymphatic follicles and germinal centres were never detected. 4. Polytypic plasma cells were seen in low or moderate numbers mainly in the lymph node sinuses, while neither marked plasmacytic hyperplasia nor even a monotypic pattern were found. 5. Immune-accessory reticulum cells were detected only in the lymph nodes of the patient who survived 12 months. 6. Natural killer cells occurred only in low numbers irrespective of the duration of survival after BMT. Altogether, the histopathological lymph node findings clearly reflect the marked long-standing depression of the immune responses seen after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Since three of the four patients had shown signs of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, the histological findings presumably do not fully reflect the normal reconstitution of the immune system, but may have been modified by phenomena related to graft-versus-host disease.","['Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",['10.1007/BF00320632 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using a monoclonal anti-TfR antibody (OKT9) and a polyclonal antibody against surface membrane-bound transferrin, a proportion of blasts from all the patients was found to express receptors for transferrin. Further analysis of OKT9 expression using a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) showed that the TfR was heterogeneously distributed in the blast cell population. In five out of six samples studied, stimulation of DNA synthesis following short-term culture induced a several-fold increase in TfR display as analysed by flow cytometry using OKT9 or FITC-conjugated transferrin. Blasts from seven patients stained with OKT9 were separated on the FACS into positive and negative or weakly positive fractions. Culture of the TfR negative population in a blast cell colony assay produced no colonies in either of two patients. In a further five patients the colony forming cells were predominantly associated with the TfR strongly positive fraction (52 +/- 25 colonies/10(4) cells) rather than the TfR weakly positive fraction (12 +/- 11 colonies/10(4) cells). Analysis of colony size showed that clones derived from the weakly positive fraction were smaller than clones from the TfR strongly positive fraction. These results suggest that TfR display by AML blasts is related to their proliferative capacity and is expressed by the leukaemic stem cell fraction.","['Department of Haematology, City Hospital, Nottingham.']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07633.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Also a reduction of leukemia cells in peripheral blood was observed in all 4 leukemia patients following intravenous (i.v.) administration of rH-TNF. Furthermore, in 2 multiple myeloma patients, the myeloma protein and plasma cells in bone marrow were reduced by i.v. administration of rH-TNF. 2) Self-induction of defense against rH-TNF cytotoxicity Investigation of the effect of TNF on RNA and protein synthesis by tumorigenic and normal cell lines showed that their synthesis in tumor cells was increased at 12 h and peaked at 24 h of incubation with TNF, while that in normal diploid fibroblast (HEL) cells was apparently unaffected by the presence of TNF. Artificial inhibition of either RNA or protein synthesis by L-M cells, upon addition of Act D or CHI increased the cytotoxic effect of TNF, thus suggesting that the elevated RNA and protein synthesis is related not to the cytotoxic reaction itself but rather to a defense mechanism. Similar incubation of HEL cells with TNF in the presence of either inhibitor resulted in the occurrence of cytotoxicity not observed with TNF alone, thus suggesting the existence of a defense mechanism in normal, TNF-resistant cells which is absent or greatly weakened in tumor cells. 3) Combination therapy of rH-TNF with various anticancer drugs. A synergistic increase in the cytotoxic effects of rH-TNF and anti-cancer drugs was demonstrated in vitro The cytotoxicity of rH-TNF against L-M cells in combination with MMC, ADM, Ara-C, ACD, DM, CDDP, VCR and 5-FU was 4 to 347 times as high as that of rH-TNF alone. These results suggest that combination therapy including rH-TNF and anti-cancer drugs may be of value in the treatment of malignancy in human patients.","['Dept. of Internal Medicine (Section 4), Sapporo Medical College.']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

After its incorporation into cells, 5-FU is metabolized through the uracil pathway, and finally incorporated into various species of RNA. On the other hand, 5-FU metabolized to FdUMP forms a covalent ternary complex among TS and mTHF, and inhibits de novo TMP synthesis, resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. However, 5-FU was found to exert an effect on TS- mutant FM3A cells which was almost as lethal as the effect on wild-type FM3A cells in the presence of thymidine. Therefore, this lethal effect could be attributable to the inhibition of RNA metabolism, rather than DNA metabolism. The effects of 5-FU on RNA metabolism in L1210 cells are as follows: (1) inhibition of the processing of preribosomal RNA to ribosomal RNA (2) inhibition of the synthesis of poly(A) RNA of mRNA (3) inhibition of tRNA methylation (4) impaired synthesis of snRNA, U4, U6. (5) inhibition of pre-rRNA methylation (6) enhancement of poly(A) RNA translation.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients treated in prospectively randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS: Three hundred twenty-six patients with pathologic stage I, II, or III, A or B Hodgkin disease treated between 1967 and 1980 with median follow-up exceeding 14 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients at the same stage of disease were randomized to receive radiation alone (167 patients) or radiation followed by 6 cycles of mechlorethamine hydrochloride, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy (159 patients) with additional therapy for progression or recurrence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No significant differences between treatment regimens for actuarial survival, intercurrent disease, or Hodgkin disease mortality were seen. Thirty-three patients who received radiation alone and 30 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy died without evident Hodgkin disease. Death was caused by second neoplasms in 28 patients (relative risk, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.24). Six patients developed acute myelogenous leukemia or a myeloproliferative disorder after treatment including MOPP. Chemotherapy exposure varied among the 8 patients with lung cancers, 6 with gastrointestinal and 3 with other adenocarcinomas, 3 with sarcomas, 1 with diffuse large cell lymphoma, and 1 with melanoma. Acute myocardial infarction caused 9 of 17 cardiovascular disease deaths with 5 occurring in patients between the ages of 33 and 43. Nonetheless, the risk for acute myocardial infarction was not clearly increased (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.57). Fifteen patients died from infection: 5, opportunistic; 5, asplenic sepsis; and 5, other pneumonias. Two patients died in accidents, and 1 died from radiation pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant MOPP chemotherapy improved freedom from relapse without significant survival benefit or impairment. Leukemogenesis was the only lethal complication associated with MOPP.

The malignant cell, therefore, remains in the proliferative pool and rapidly accumulates. In preleukemia, also known as myelodysplastic syndromes, the malignant clone is already established, leading to disturbed hematopoiesis. One therapeutic approach, therefore, might be to overcome this block in differentiation and thus shift the cell from the proliferative into the differentiating pool. For several years now research in leukemia has focused on study of the proliferation and differentiation of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells. Numerous substances have been identified which are able to trigger differentiation in myeloid cells, including the retinoids, vitamin D, tumor necrosis factor and hematopoietic hormones.

Graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, graft-versus-leukemia, delayed immune reconstitution, often associated or mutually exclusive are observed even with an HLA identical sibling donor. Syngeneic transplants may be complicated by leukemic relapse related to the loss of the graft-versus-leukemia effect. The compilation of files of unrelated donors increases the possibility of finding a matched unrelated donor. Preliminary results suggest that clinical results may be equivalent to those achieved with HLA identical sibling donors. Overall results of HLA mismatched transplants are disappointing because of the increase of immunological complications. Attempts at preventing graft-versus-host disease with T cell depletion led to an increase of immunological complications: rejection and leukemic relapse. Modifications of the conditioning regimen and use of in vivo monoclonal antibodies are currently being investigated. Ethical, legal, and psychological considerations have also to be taken into account in the donor choice especially with the increase of the donor pool.","['Unite Fonctionnelle de Greffe de Moelle Osseuse, Hopital Saint-Louis, France.']",,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,Interactions hote-greffon au cours des greffes de moelle osseuse allogeniques; choix du donneur.,,,,,,,,

In the follow-up of bone marrow grafted patients plasma markers of endothelial function (von Willebrand's factor, tissue type plasminogen activator, and plasma activity of angiotensin converting enzyme) were significantly altered at the time of overdose with cyclosporin A, probably due to a drug-induced in vivo lesion of the endothelium.

Age greater than 50 years adversely affected overall survival. But no obvious survival differences were seen by sex and the primary site. Patients with NH had a significantly poorer survival (P less than 0.01), while there were no differences among the other histologic groups. Aggressive combination chemotherapy is advisable for patients with stages II, II and IV NH. But radiotherapy along may be treatment choice for patients with stage I NH. Because among stage I, over all survival and relapse-free survival of patients with NH were similar to those with the other histologic types. Five-year and 10-year relapse-free survival of stage I patients with the other 3 histologic types by radiotherapy alone were 85% and 67%, respectively. Those of stage II patients were both 58%.

Studies of the association between disease and residence near installations transmitting or generating electricity and studies of the health of workers in the electrical industry are reviewed. Most of the investigations relate to cancer, although other conditions such as outcome of pregnancy have been studied. The most consistent finding is that electrical workers appear to be at increased risk of leukaemia, especially acute myeloid leukaemia. The effect is small. Combining the results of eleven separate investigations suggests an 18% increase in the risk of leukaemia (RR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29) which is partly or wholly due to a 46% increase in the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.27-1.65). It is not clear whether this increase is specific to certain types of work within the electrical industry. Nor is it possible to determine from the available data if the increase in leukaemia is due to electromagnetic fields or to other factors to which electrical workers are exposed. There is no clear association between cancer risk and residence near sources transmitting electricity, although some data suggest that there may be small increases in leukaemia in those living very close to the sources. The relationship between adverse outcome of pregnancy and exposure to sources of ELF electromagnetic fields needs further investigation. Studies of the possible effects of ELF electromagnetic fields on health are hampered by problems in measuring exposure and by the ubiquity of exposure in the community.","['Unit of Descriptive Epidemiology, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",,,['10.1093/ije/17.1.1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal antibody, a rat IgG2a, was conjugated with a bifunctional chelating agent, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid at a 1:1 molecular ratio and complexed with 111-indium, a procedure which apparently did not alter its binding to peritoneal macrophages and provided relatively stable cell labelling. An unrelated rat IgG2a of unknown specificity radiolabelled in the same manner as 3A33 served as a control. The uptake of i.v. injected 3A33 by peritoneal macrophages was up to 50 times that of unrelated IgG2a. After i.v. inoculation, the antibody accumulated in the liver, spleen, lung, in foot-pad inflammatory reactions induced by injection of Freund's adjuvant and in experimentally grafted tumours. The 3A33: non-specific IgG2a uptake ratio in inflammatory lesions and tumours, however, was much lower than for peritoneal macrophages and was generally close to 2. This was sufficient to obtain scintigraphic images of inflammations and tumours. The images obtained after injection of 3A33 were clearly of better quality than those given by the non-specific immunoglobulin. They could be improved by subtraction of the vascular images obtained after injection of 99m-technetium serum albumin. The labelling of Mac-1-positive blood mononuclear cells by in vitro incubation with radioactive 3A33 was not intense enough to allow scintigraphic imaging after in vivo re-infusion but seemed more selective than the injection of whole antibody in detecting inflammatory reactions. These results seem interesting in view of the potential human application to the detection inflammatory lesions and the appreciation of tumour inflammatory components.

These techniques aid in the assignment of cell lineage in cases of acute leukaemia in which the standard FAB criteria of morphology and cytochemistry do not reveal clear lymphoid or myeloid phenotype. These new techniques have also revealed that the leukaemic blasts in a sizable minority of otherwise typical cases of acute leukaemia express 'inappropriate' lineage-associated markers and have been termed mixed acute leukaemias. The spectrum of characteristics encompassed by mixed acute leukaemias ranges from fairly common cases expressing one or two inappropriate markers to the more extreme, rare cases of acute leukaemia termed 'hybrid' in which a truly scrambled picture is seen. A subgroup of these mixed cases have two distinct populations of blasts, e.g. one lymphoid and the other myeloid. These observations raise a number of issues about the cell of origin of these leukaemias and about the mechanisms controlling the developmental regulation of expression of different lineage-associated markers. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that inappropriate expression of markers may identify sub-groups of both acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia with an inferior prognosis.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",,,"['0268-960X(88)90003-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(88)90003-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

This difference remains significant when adjusted to the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the two groups. Three cases of veino-occlusive disease were observed (10%), but only in the STBI group.

This does not mean that the administered dose-intensity should be ignored; in fact these data indicate the importance of documenting and assessing administered dose-intensity as an initial step toward identifying those situations where systemic dose-intensity may be most important. The studies described in this review were selected as representative examples of successful clinical pharmacodynamic studies; other published examples include vincristine AUC versus severity of neurotoxicity, etoposide systemic exposure versus leukopenia, red cell concentration of mercaptopurine metabolites versus neutropenia in children with ALL, and ARA-CTP retention in leukemic blasts versus clinical response in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. As is the case with other types of clinical trials in cancer patients, there are also examples of negative pharmacodynamic studies (i.e., no relationship found between concentration and effects). There are several possible reasons for such negative findings, including the lack of such a relationship for some drugs, measuring the inappropriate drug moiety (e.g., failure to measure all active metabolites), measuring drug concentrations in the wrong biological fluid, evaluating systemic exposure over too narrow a range (i.e., all patients have either sub- or supra-therapeutic systemic exposure), selecting inappropriate sampling times or pharmacokinetic parameters, inadequately assessing drug toxicity or response, or simply studying an inadequate number of patients or patients with drug-resistant cancers. Therefore, negative findings in some pharmacodynamic studies should not deter the investigation of other drugs and/or other malignant diseases, just as negative therapeutic trials do not preclude subsequent clinical trials in oncology. Also, finding a relation between systemic exposure and drug toxicity, in the absence of a clear relation to antitumor effects, is potentially of great clinical utility. Such data should allow more objective escalation of drug dosages in individual patients, to ensure maximum dose-intensity while avoiding host toxicity. Obviously, if such dose escalation could be guided by more easily measured patient characteristics (e.g., age, weight, CrCl, shoe size, etc.), then using drug concentrations in individual patients might be obviated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[""Pharmaceutical Division, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R 37 CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],['10.1007/BF00320282 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The AML is often resistant to treatment and relapse is common. Children with chronic MPD die of bone marrow failure or evolve to AML or myelofibrosis. We have treated these children intensively with combination chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Four children with MPD received supportive care and low dose chemotherapy alone. They all died, surviving between 4 months and 4 years. Six children with MPD received intensive chemotherapy: three remitted, one relapsing after 9 months, the others remaining in remission at 18 months and 3 years.

The present study is based on a flexible policy of marrow transplantation (allograft and autograft without marrow purging) in first remission compared with a group treated with standard maintenance therapy after a common induction sequence. The actuarial disease free survival (DFS) and actuarial overall survival (OS) at 3 years for autologous marrow grafted patients was 30% and 65% respectively. The allogeneic transplant group had DFS of 30% and OS at 3 years of 38% compared with DFS (12%) and OS (12%) for patients on 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate maintenance. The actuarial disease free survival calculations include patients on protocol not entering remission, therefore, giving the worst possible result. We conclude that high dose chemo/radiotherapy with autologous marrow rescue in first remission followed by no maintenance provides better results in terms of overall survival and quality of life than standard ALL maintenance in adult patients. Results for allogeneic transplant in ALL are less good in terms of duration and quality of survival and the majority of deaths are related to causes other than leukaemic relapse.","['Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07599.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two intramuscular injections totaling 3 U/kg body weight during the first 30 hours of treatment lowered the plasma urate level from 910 to 190 mumol/L (15.3 to 3.2 mg/dL), after which a dose of 2 U/kg every 5 to 6 days maintained the plasma urate level at 540 mumol/L (9 mg/dL) or lower. After the injection of PEG-uricase, uricase activity appeared in plasma rapidly, peaking within 24 hours and persisting for approximately 5 days; an inverse relation between plasma uricase activity and plasma urate concentration was noted. The agent was nontoxic and well tolerated. No antibody to either PEG-uricase or unmodified uricase developed over a 3-week period, during which four doses of PEG-uricase were administered. Because of its long circulating life, PEG-uricase is probably a more effective hypouricemic agent than unmodified uricase, which has previously had limited use.

To test this hypothesis 174 patients receiving an HLA-identical allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) for aplastic anemia (n = 32) or leukemia (n = 142) were analyzed for factors associated with acute GVHD. Variables analyzed included diagnosis, sex, age, blood group of donor and recipient, ABO compatibility, Rhesus compatibility, sex compatibility, number of bone marrow cells given at BMT, year of transplant, day of engraftment, and GVHD prophylaxis. We first carried out an exploratory contingency table analysis: minor ABO incompatibility was associated with a significantly higher risk of severe acute GVHD when compared with ABO-matched and major-ABO mismatched pairs (P = 0.003): 14/9, 57/67, and 5/22 patients developed, respectively, 0-I/II-IV acute GVHD in ABO major-mismatched, matched, and minor-mismatched pairs. Donors of group 0, (P = 0.06), older recipient's age (P = 0.08), fast engraftment (P = 0.03), and older donor's age (0.08) were also associated with a higher risk of GVHD. Recipient's ABO group, diagnosis, year of transplant, Rhesus group of donor or recipient, Rhesus compatibility, sex of donor or recipient, sex compatibility, and type of GVHD prophylaxis were not predictive of GVHD. A Cox multifactorial proportional hazards analysis confirmed that ABO matching was the single most significant factor associated with GVHD (P = 0.006). The cumulative incidence of GVHD grade II+ was 39%, 54%, and 82% for ABO major-mismatched, matched, and minor-mismatched pairs (P = 0.01).

The path lengths through the trabeculae and marrow cavities are measured with a bone-scanning microscope and other bone data, such as trabecular surface areas, can also be derived. Results are given for human bones and for bones of the beagle, miniature pig and rhesus monkey. They show that, for the same radionuclide concentration, the doses to endosteal tissues and bone marrow are several times greater in animal than in human bone, and that higher doses in human bone from the Ca and Sr radionuclides are obtained if the initial deposition on bone surfaces is allowed for. Other studies show that the occurrence of osteosarcoma in the human long bones correlates well with trabecular surface area and also that, unlike the case of beta-particles from 90Sr+90Y, leukaemia is not a significant consequence of the alpha-particle doses from 226Ra in human bone or from 226Ra, 239Pu and other alpha emitters in beagle bone.","['University of Leeds, Cookridge Hospital, UK.']",,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)', 'YZS2RPE8LE (Strontium)']",['10.1088/0031-9155/33/4/001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclosporine was given either orally or intravenously at full doses from the day before transplantation until day 50; it was then tapered off and discontinued on day 180. Trough concentrations of serum cyclosporine were measured by radioimmunoassay. The relation between patients' characteristics and the risk of acute GVHD was analyzed with a relative-risk regression model. In 66 patients (37 percent), grades II to IV of acute GVHD developed 7 to 66 days (median, 13) after transplantation. The trough cyclosporine concentration for a given week was significantly associated with the risk that acute GVHD would develop during the following week. The relative risks were 0.7 (i.e., there was a 30 percent reduction in risk) for every increase of 100 ng per milliliter in cyclosporine concentration and 1.0, 0.60, and 0.20 for concentrations of less than 100, 100 to 199, and 200 or more ng per milliliter, respectively (P less than 0.01). A patient's age, prophylaxis regimen, and year of transplantation also influenced the risk of acute GVHD significantly.

All of these malignancies show a propensity to metastasize to bone marrow. Occasionally when the clinical picture is unclear and the tumor is particularly anaplastic, it can be difficult to arrive at a diagnosis by conventional histological and biochemical procedures. In the present study, a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies was used to undertake a detailed analysis of seven bone marrows contaminated with tumor cells: six cases of stage IV neuroblastoma, and one case of stage IV-S neuroblastoma. The antibody profiles obtained were compared with those deduced from the studies of over 20 marrows from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A comparison of these data with those obtained from the studies of rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma cell lines and tissues suggests that when high levels of tumor cells are present in the marrow, it is possible to obtain a confident diagnosis of either neuroblastoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

In the great majority of cases, an increase of 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake was obtained in response to at least one conditioned medium. The labeling index (LI) and the growth fraction (GF), evaluated in a restricted group of cases, were also increased by the growth factors, suggesting that they act by recruiting leukemic cells in cycle from the resting compartment. The ability of blast populations to form colonies was also studied. Conditioned media were found to induce or significantly increase the clonogenic capacity in 20 cases out of 22. The response of leukemic cells to human recombinant CSFs and rhIL-1, used alone or in combination, was also assayed. The results, in agreement with those obtained with conditioned media, show that each leukemic case displays a different pattern of response to CSFs, and that optimal growth conditions must be individually assessed. The possibility of increasing the fraction of cycling cells in AML populations may represent a way to render them more sensitive to cytostatic agents, with a view to new therapeutic strategies.","['Istituto di Medicina Interna, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90064-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the variation in, and the control level of, the accumulation of the transformation-associated cellular protein p53 in murine erythroleukemia cells induced to differentiate by hexamethylene bisacetamide. Using flow cytofluorimetry after double staining of the cells, we have found that p53 decreased from two hours after the input of the inducer, to reach a basal level of about 30% of the starting value. The stability of the protein was found to be affected neither by the inducer nor by the position of the cells in the cell cycle. Looking for the regulation mechanism of the p53 decay, we found that the mRNA started to decrease as early as half an hour after the hexamethylene bisacetamide was put in the culture medium, and that the transcription rate of the gene itself could not account for the observed down-regulation of the mRNA, suggesting a post-transcriptional control for the mRNA accumulation. This control did not require the de-novo synthesis of a protein component, as shown by cycloheximide experiments, but seemed to be governed by the induced synthesis of an RNA molecule.

We have been interested in the use of a particular monoclonal antibody to LNF-III, PM-81, in the treatment of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia using the antibody to treat bone marrow in vitro. Following in vitro treatment of bone marrow with PM-81 and another MoAb, AML-2-23, the remaining cells are used as an autograft in a patient treated with high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In order to enhance the ability of the MoAb to lyse leukemic cells in the remission bone marrow, we have explored the effect of neuraminidase treatment on leukemia cells. In this paper we describe that myeloid leukemia cells expressing low levels of LNF-III by immunofluorescence can be shown to have high levels of LNF-III after neuraminidase treatment. In addition, we show that normal bone marrow progenitor cells do not have cryptic LNF-III antigen, thus allowing the application of this finding to the clinical setting. Moreover, we have shown that leukemia colony-forming cells from one patient with acute myelogenous leukemia express cryptic LNF-III and that after exposure to neuraminidase there was an increased ability of PM-81 in the presence of complement to eliminate these colony forming cells. These data indicate that the LNF-III moiety is almost universally expressed on myeloid leukemia cells and their progenitors but not expressed on normal progenitors.

These changes in the biological behavior of the tumor cells are presumably secondary to resulting changes in their susceptibility to immune recognition and destruction. Murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) exert regulatory effects on class I genes of the MHC locus. MuLV infection results in substantial increases in cell surface expression of all three class I MHC antigens. These viral effects on MHC antigen expression profoundly influence immune-mediated interaction with the infected cells, as assessed by cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition and killing. Control of class I MHC and beta-2 microglobulin genes by MuLV takes place via a trans-acting molecular mechanism. MuLV controls expression of widely separated endogenous cellular MHC genes, transfected xenogeneic class I MHC genes, and unintegrated chimeric genes consisting of fragments of class I MHC genes linked to a bacterial reporter gene. These findings indicate that MuLV exerts its effects on MHC expression via a trans mechanism.

In this study, we have simultaneously measured steady-state c-myc protein and c-myc mRNA levels in differentiating Friend murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Northern blot analysis of poly(A+) RNA indicated a greater than 85% decrease in c-myc transcripts following a brief exposure to the inducing agents, dimethyl sulfoxide or hypoxanthine. The short half-life of the c-myc protein (approximately 30 min) suggests that its level should fall in a similar fashion. Surprisingly, immunoblots of total cell proteins and immunoprecipitations of 35S-labeled protein revealed that c-myc protein levels remain approximately constant. This unexpected finding was accounted for in part by an increase in the c-myc protein half-life to 75-85 min. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins also demonstrated that the undifferentiated MEL cell synthesizes equal amounts of two c-myc-related proteins, p59 and p61.

In nine out of 13 cases, the leukaemic blasts were found to be highly sensitive to AISPc. In six of the sensitive cases clonogenic assays revealed that only 2 +/- 1% of AML progenitor cells survived AISPc treatment under conditions which permitted a GM-CFC recovery of 60 +/- 11%. AISPc photosensitization was also shown to selectively eliminate the leukaemic cell line K562 from an in vitro model of minimal residual disease. Thus photosensitization using AISPc may be an effective method of purging marrow autografts in some cases of AML. Evaluation of the sensitivity of AML clonogenic cells at diagnosis may identify those patients in whom AISPc photo-purging may be of benefit at the time of an autologous bone marrow transplant.","['Department of Haematology, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London.']",,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '122170-90-5 (aluminum tetrasulfophthalocyanine)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb04228.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Indication are types and stages of leukemia with a poor prognosis following chemotherapy, such as acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in first complete remission (CR) of the disease, and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) following relapse of the disease, in second CR. On the basis of our own experience and of analysis of published data it can be stated that allogeneic BMT, grafting bone marrow cells from a healthy HLA-identical sibling of the patient, has a long-term therapeutical effect which is superior to that of chemotherapy alone: in cases of ANLL, grafted in first CR, a long-term disease-free survival of 55 to 67% was obtained, and in cases of ALL, grafted in second CR, this was between 38 and 64%. The potential effect of autologous BMT, i.e. with own bone marrow of the patient, sampled during CR of the disease, cannot yet be evaluated properly, because the follow-up period of this mode of treatment is too short. It is worth while to investigate the potential beneficial effect of autologous BMT, e.g. for children with ALL in second CR, who lack a HLA-identical donor. Also the potential contribution of bone marrow purging, e.g. for CALLA-positive lymphocytes, should be investigated in relation to the relapse risk after autologous BMT for common ALL.","['Vakgroep Kindergeneeskunde, Rijksuniversiteit Leiden.']",,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,De bijdrage van beenmergtransplantatie aan de behandeling van kinderen met leukemie.,,,,,,,,

This synergism is caused by a selective inhibition of the purine de novo synthesis in malignant lymphoblasts by MTX, associated with an enhanced intracellular uptake of 6MP. Pharmacokinetic studies of MTX in various schemes of prophylactic central nervous system treatment in ALL are discussed. Treatment with 24-hr infusions of MTX in a dosage of 5 g/m2, as recommended in the new BFM-86/SNWLK ALL VII protocol, seems to be optimal. Pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous 6MP infusions demonstrated a good cerebral fluid penetration. Exploiting the synergistic action of the combination of MTX and 6MP may offer an improvement of the prophylactic central nervous systems treatment in ALL in the future, using intravenous administration of both MTX and 6MP.","['Kinderoncologisch Centrum Zuid-Oost Nederland.

(i) The virus life cycle includes several events--in particular, reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into DNA, orderly integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes, and utilization of host mechanisms for gene expression in response to viral signals--which are broadly informative about eukaryotic cells and viruses. (ii) Retroviral oncogenesis usually depends on transduction or insertional activation of cellular genes, and isolation of those genes has provided the scientific community with many of the molecular components now implicated in the control of normal growth and in human cancer. (iii) Retroviruses include many important veterinary pathogens and two recently discovered human pathogens, the causative agents of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. (iv) Retroviruses are genetic vectors in nature and can be modified to serve as genetic vectors for both experimental and therapeutic purposes.

Our results demonstrate that elevated expression of the mouse p53 gene, driven by its natural promoter and in the absence of strong heterologous promoters and/or enhancers, can efficiently immortalize early-passage rat embryo fibroblasts. p53-immortalized cells but not p44-immortalized cells could be morphologically transformed by secondary transfection with activated Ha-ras.

An analysis of 117 cell lines derived from 17 such leukemic mice showed that they displayed different patterns of growth in vitro ranging from full autonomy to absolute dependency on stimulation by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or multipotential colony stimulating factor (multi-CSF). In contrast to parental FDC-P1 cells, even the factor-dependent variant cell lines were tumorigenic in vivo. The behavior of these latter cell lines could not be explained by hyperresponsiveness to CSFs or prolonged survival in the absence of CSFs. Conditioned media and cell lysates from leukemic cell lines from 8 animals contained variable levels of GM-CSF or multi-CSF. Proliferation of a GM-CSF-producing cell line was inhibited by anti-GM-CSF antibody, while both the parental FDC-P1 line and a leukemic line secreting multi-CSF remained unaffected. The patterns of growth in vitro of the leukemic cells tended to correlate with the amounts of CSFs produced. The observations show that leukemic transformation of FDC-P1 cells in vivo is frequently linked to autogenous production of hemopoietic growth factors. The range of abnormal in vitro growth patterns observed includes those typical of human acute myeloid leukemia, and the in vivo transformation model may be useful in analyzing the mechanisms leading to the development of this human disease.","['Cancer Research Unit, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The subsequent 27 patients had received an extra fraction of TBI (7 x 2 Gy), and only one failed to have stable engraftment. There were no differences in nucleated cell dose, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, or T cell numbers given to the two groups. Neutrophil but not platelet regeneration of those patients who successfully grafted was slower than in a group of historical controls receiving unmanipulated marrow.

Recent data indicate that HDARAC at doses of 2-3 g/M2 every 12 hr x 10-12 doses is of comparable or greater efficacy in remission induction as standard doses of cytarabine in acute myelogenous leukemia. HDARAC can also produce remissions in individuals resistant to conventional doses. HDARAC-containing regimens are reported to result in substantially higher long-term, disease-free survival than previous approaches to post-remission therapy, but this has not yet been confirmed in controlled trials. HDARAC is also active in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Because intravenous HDARAC achieves high levels in the spinal fluid, it is useful to treat central nervous system leukemia and may provide adequate CNS prophylaxis in acute lymphocytic leukemia. HDARAC is reported to be active in advanced non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic myelogenous leukemia in acute phase; optimal use in these settings is under study. HDARAC has also been combined with other drugs. Randomized trials are needed to determine whether these combinations are more effective than HDARAC alone. Apart from potent myelosuppression, the dose-limiting toxicity of HDARAC is cerebellar damage. This occurs with increased frequency in patients greater than 50 years old. HDARAC is active in hematologic malignancies and may further improve therapeutic results if combined with other drugs.","['Hematology-Oncology Section, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia.']","['CA 16520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1977 until 1980, 317 patients were randomized among the same two therapy programs and a control group. With a minimum follow-up in either phase of greater than 7 years, data are now mature. They show no difference in relapse-free survival (RFS) nor overall survival (OS) in either the two-way phase or in the three-way phase. There is no indication, except possibly in one very small subset, that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy provides an improvement in OS or in RFS. Using data from patients accrued after randomization to the control group, we fail to find evidence that either chemotherapy alone or chemoimmunotherapy improves OS or RFS when contrasted to outcomes obtained by patients on the control arm. In fact, we have significant evidence, at the P = .016 level, that chemotherapy does not improve OS by at least 50%; we also have significant evidence, at the P = .011 level, that chemoimmunotherapy will not improve OS by at least 25%. No evidence of efficacy was demonstrated for either treatment regimen, even though enough therapy was given to result in significant toxicities.

However, both the previously studied Mov-3 and Mov-14 strains differ from the coisogenic C57BL/6 strain by different length segments of chromosome derived from the ICR strain in addition to the integrated M-MuLV genome. To conclusively demonstrate that an Ag encoded by M-MuLV is solely responsible for rejection of Mov skin grafts by coisogenic recipients, we have studied additional Mov strains that differ from coisogenic 129 or BALB/c backgrounds only by integration of an M-MuLV genome. A total of 129 strain recipients reject skin grafts from two viremic Mov strains, Mov-17 and Mov-18. A total of 129 strain hosts primed with either 1) multiple sets of Mov-17 and Mov-18 skin grafts or 2) single injections of Mov-17 and Mov-18 spleen cells produce M-MuLV-specific CTL that could be boosted in primary mixed lymphocyte culture. Generated CTL were reactive with Con A-stimulated lymphoblasts from all tested viremic Mov strains on the B6 and 129 backgrounds as well as B6 lymphomas. Further, we have observed that 129 strain mice reject Mov-9 skin grafts if these skin grafts are transplanted to virgin 129 recipients which have not received prior skin grafts from non-viremic Mov donors. In addition, skin grafts were transplanted from two viremic Mov strains, Mov-15 and Mov-16, to coisogenic BALB/c recipients; rejection of both sets of grafts was observed. However, BALB/c responders did not generate specific CTL after priming in vivo, with either multiple sets of allogeneic grafts or spleen cell injections, and boosting in vitro. These observations confirm the ability of integrated and expressed M-MuLV genomes to encode what is operationally defined as a non-H-2 histocompatibility Ag.","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']","['AI-16052/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-19105/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All allogeneic BMT procedures involved T-lymphocyte depletion for prevention of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Five HSV-seronegative patients did not receive acyclovir, and they did not develop HSV infection. Oral acyclovir was administered to 15 HSV-seropositive BMT recipients; 14 untreated HSV-seropositive BMT recipients served as a control group. The adult dose of acyclovir was 400 mg three times a day on Days -6 to +14 and 200 mg three times a day on Days +15 to +90. Children received 500 mg/m2 per day divided into three equal doses on Days -6 to +14 and 250 mg/m2 per day again divided into three on Days +15 to +90. In the group on prophylaxis, only one developed HSV infection during the time prior to engraftment. In the reference group, 12 of 14 (85.7%) developed oral HSV infection within 0 to 16 days (median 11 days) after the transplantation. Time for engraftment (duration of neutropenia) was shorter in patients receiving acyclovir. After engraftment, HSV infection was not observed during administration or following discontinuation of acyclovir on Day 90, but occurred in three patients in whom acyclovir was discontinued on Days 25, 35 and 40 after BMT. In the untreated group, two patients had recurrence of HSV infection on Days 40 to 60, and one had two infectious episodes. GVHD occurred in only two recipients, neither of whom had HSV infection. We conclude that the incidence of HSV infection during the period until engraftment in recipients of T-lymphocyte-depleted BMT is high, similar to that reported by others in recipients of whole BMT. Relatively low-dose oral acyclovir administered for 90 days can effectively prevent HSV infections in previously HSV-seropositive BMT recipients and may also shorten the period until engraftment.","['Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The neoplastic cells invariably expressed IgM, most B lineage antigens (B1, TO15, Leu-12, 6A4, 41H, BA-1, and LN-2), and Ia. IgD was expressed in 12 cases. Leu-1 and Leu-8 were weakly expressed by the tumor cells in 12 and 11 cases, respectively. The neoplastic cells did not express common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) or the T10 antigen in any case. Because ILL is difficult to differentiate from small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma (DSCCL) on the basis of light microscopic criteria, the immunologic findings of ILL were compared to 31 cases of B cell SLL and 11 cases of B cell DSCCL previously studied in the laboratory to determine if immunologic findings might aid in the distinction. No absolute, and five statistically significant, differences were found; IgD in combination with IgM was seen more commonly in cases of ILL and DSCCL than in SLL (P less than .01), IgG was found more often in SLL than in ILL and DSCCL (P less than .05), Leu-8 was more commonly expressed in ILL and SLL than in DSCCL (P less than .05), T9 expression was less frequent in ILL as compared with SLL (P less than .05) and more proliferating cells were seen in ILL and DSCCL than in SLL (P less than .01). The investigators conclude that these three classes of lymphoma are remarkable much more for their immunologic similarities than for their differences and that immunologic studies are of limited usefulness in differentiating the three neoplasms. Their results also support the concept that these lymphomas are closely related to each other. In particular, DSCCL immunologically appears to be more closely related to SLL and ILL than to follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305.']",['CA-34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)']","['S0046-8177(88)80203-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(88)80203-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

By using a strategy for analysis of gene mutation based on in vitro amplification of target sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and selective oligonucleotide hybridization we analyzed the mutational status of codons 12, 13, and 61 of Ha-ras, K-ras, and N-ras in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) in 34 cases of primary MDS. Mutations at codon 12 of Ki-ras or N-ras were detected in three cases (9%): one of six cases of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and two of nine cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The nucleotide substitution differed in each. In all cases the mutant allele was detectable in PB cells. A sustained hematologic remission was achieved after low-dose cytarabine therapy in the case of RAEB. Neither case of CMML exhibited signs of disease progression during follow-up at 7 and 12 months. In contrast, four of 31 patients without the ras mutation underwent transformation to AML within 12 months of genetic analysis. We conclude that ras mutations in MDS are heterogeneous and may develop at an early stage during the evolution of MDS.

To determine if such changes might be correlated with therapeutic outcome, we studied steady-state mRNA levels of MYC and histone H3 in the leukemic blasts of patients just prior to and 24 hr after the administration of the first doses of antileukemic drug therapy. Among nine patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, mRNA levels of MYC and histone H3 were reduced in five patients, and hematologic remission was achieved in three of these individuals. No remission was obtained in the four patients without reduction in MYC and histone H3 mRNA. Among acute lymphocytic leukemia patients, the mRNA levels of MYC and/or histone H3 were reduced by the therapy in seven of nine patients. A complete hematologic remission was obtained in five of them, and a partial remission was obtained in the other two. No remission was obtained in the patients in which MYC and H3 mRNA levels were unaffected by the therapy. These studies are of interest because they suggest that a decrease in the mRNA levels of MYC and histone H3 24 hr after a single dose of antineoplastic drugs may predict which patients will achieve complete remission; lack of reduction in these mRNAs correlates with failure to achieve remission.

CML is characterized by the t(9:22) chromosome translocation which results in translocation of the oncogene abl from chromosome 9 into the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene on chromosome 22. We cloned and characterized the cDNA of the normal bcr gene. The bcr gene codes for a protein of 1271 amino acids. The open reading frame is preceded by a region high in GC. At the 5' of this region we identified several GC motifs which are probably involved in the initiation of bcr transcription. bcr transcripts of 7.0 and 4.5 kb are expressed in all cell types examined. These transcripts share all cDNA sequences analysed, including the 5' untranslated region. The latter as well as 902 or 927 amino acids are included within the CML-specific bcr-abl mRNA transcribed from the chimeric bcr-abl gene on chromosome 22. In addition to the complete bcr gene, the human genome contains 3 bcr-related genes containing the last seven exons of the intact bcr gene. One of these genes was analysed in detail and showed high sequence homology with the latter.

GVHD has limited the use of this technique to HLA-matched donor recipient pairs. Thus, only a quarter of patients who ultimately may have benefited from bone marrow transplantation are currently eligible. Even in matched patient recipient pairs, GVHD accounts for approximately 40% of the deaths following allogeneic bone marrow transplants. One of the major challenges for transplantation is to derive better strategies to prevent and treat GVHD while retaining the allogeneic benefit of graft-versus-leukemia. Current pharmacologic approaches have used cyclosporine, usually in combination with other drugs. More experimental approaches have removed lymphocytes from the marrow grafts. With either approach, maintaining the anti-leukemic benefit of an allogeneic transplant (i.e., immunologic attack of the leukemia resulting in a lower relapse rate), will need to be maintained if that approach will ultimately prove to be useful.","['Johns Hopkins Bone Marrow Unit, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']","['CA 15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Cyclosporins)'],['10.1097/00005792-198805000-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

According to this concept, an enhanced immune suppression as induced by irradiation and chemotherapy may contribute to their cytotoxic effect in inducing and maintaining a remission of the disease. Cyclosporin selectively and reversibly inhibits activation and proliferation of both normal and neoplastic T lymphocytes. In-vitro experiments and preliminary clinical data from small uncontrolled studies indicate that cyclosporin might be a promising agent in the treatment of mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin's disease, acute leukemia, and possibly other lymphoproliferative disorders, but the experience is still limited and no definitive conclusions may be made. In addition to its direct effect on lymphocytes, cyclosporin reverses the resistance of cancer cells to several antineoplastic agents and may thus find its place in combination with chemotherapy.

In 14 of 15 T-cell hematopoietic malignancies, all cells reacted with anti-MT1 and/or UCHL-1; the 1 case negative for these antigens was misdiagnosed as a B-cell tumor because of misinterpreted LN2 reactivity in benign histiocytes. Four of 5 true histiocytic neoplasms were positive for cathepsin B and LN2 but lacked other antigens; the fifth case was wrongly considered a B-cell proliferation because only bland histiocytes displayed cathepsin B. Only 1 of 7 Hodgkin's lymphomas was misdiagnosed (as a T-cell tumor); in the other 6 cases, Reed-Sternberg cells were reactive for LN2 and LEU M1.

One showed LN2, MB2, and MT1; this case was classified as a B-cell neoplasm and indeed represented a pre-B-cell transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

In order to characterize these insertions, we have isolated recombinant DNA clones from normal rat DNA containing all of the normal rat c-myc gene, and from two Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced lymphomas containing both proviral and adjacent rat c-myc sequences. We determined the DNA sequence of portions of the normal and one tumor-derived clone. The normal and tumor-derived exon 1 sequences are identical. By comparing our sequence to the sequences of mouse and human c-myc, we located the first exon of the rat c-myc gene. Analysis of the tumor-derived rat c-myc clones showed that proviral integration occurred approximately 1.4 kb upstream of exon 1 of c-myc in the case of one tumor and 0.55 kb upstream of c-myc exon 1 in the other. Thus, we conclude that the proviral insertions in these tumors did not affect the rat c-myc gene by altering the structure of the c-myc RNA. Consistent with this, the c-myc RNA present in a cell line derived from one of these tumors is identical in size to the normal c-myc RNA. Furthermore, the level of c-myc expression is not dramatically elevated in this cell line. Exon 1 of the rat c-myc gene contains no ATG start codons and contains multiple stop codons in all three reading frames, indicating that it, like the chicken and mouse exon 1 sequences, is noncoding. The extent of homology between our sequence of rat c-myc exon 1 and the published sequence of human c-myc exon 1 is similar to the extent of homology between the sequences of mouse and human c-myc exon 1. The rat and mouse c-myc exon 1 sequences differ from each other by about the amount predicted from the known divergence times of mice from rats. Exon 1 of c-myc is only slightly conserved, evolving at a rate similar to that seen for introns and pseudogenes.","['Cell Biology Group, Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts 01545.']","['1 U41 RR-01685/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA30674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",['10.1016/0042-6822(88)90619-8 [doi]'],,,,,['GENBANK/M18819'],,,,,,

One shows rearrangements within the 5.8 kb breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which forms the mid-portion of the bcr gene, on chromosome 22, while the other carries rearrangements involving a more proximal region on chromosome 22. To understand the nature of the breakpoints on chromosome 22 in bcr rearrangement negative, Ph'-positive ALLs, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the c-abl oncogene in such ALL cells. The 5' ends of the cDNA clones correspond to the normal sequences of the bcr gene first exon with two of the clones extending beyond the GCCATGG consensus sequence for the initiation of translation. The bcr sequence stops at nucleotide 1813 of the coding sequence of the bcr gene, while the c-abl sequence starts at the beginning of the second c-abl exon (nucleotide 227). Thus the joining point between bcr and c-abl is at the boundary between two exons, suggesting intronic fusion and the occurrence of a splicing event. Our current observations indicate that the Ph' translocation in bcr negative ALL involves bcr gene sequences, albeit only a proximal portion of those involved in CML. These genomic differences may be important factors in the pathogenesis of the distinct phenotypes of ALL and CML.","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/X07537'],,,,,,

In a multicenter study it is being determined, whether the use of hydroxyurea or of interferon-alpha instead of busulfan prolongs the duration of the chronic phase of Philadelphia-positive CML. Additional goals are the examination, whether the types of disease evolution and the terminal phases differ between the treatment groups, and the prospective recognition of prognostic criteria for the duration of the chronic phase of CML.

The average age is about 50 years. 59 patients reached the end of the chronic phase, 55 died. The mean observation time of all patients is 1.34 years. At present no significant difference in survival is recognizable between the busulfan and hydroxyurea groups. Fewer adverse effects have been observed in the hydroxyurea group.

These alterations are either point mutations occurring in either codon 12, 13 or 61 or, alternatively, a 5- to 50-fold amplification of the wild-type gene. Activated ras oncogenes have been found in a significant proportion of all tumors but the incidence varies considerably with the tumor type: it is relatively frequent (20-40%) in colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, but absent or present only rarely in, for example, breast tumors and stomach cancer. No correlation has been found, yet, between the presence of absence of an activated ras gene and the clinical or biological features of the malignancy. The activation of ras oncogenes is only one step in the multistep process of tumor formation. The presence of mutated ras genes in benign polyps of the colon indicates that activation can be an early event, possibly even the initiating event. However, it can also occur later in the course of carcinogenesis to initiate for instance the transition of a benign polyp of the colon into a malignant carcinoma or to convert a primary melanoma into a metastatic tumor. Apparently, the activation of ras genes is not an obligatory event but when it occurs it can contribute to both early and advanced stages of human carcinogenesis.","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Sylvius Laboratories, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']","['0165-1110(88)90004-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(88)90004-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

The blood quiescent immunocompetent cells retained their DNA-uracil exclusion capacity, even in the oldest age groups.

These dimers elicit antitumor properties through a new mechanism of action. Recently, a relationship was found between their antitumor properties and their cytotoxic effect on the polA Escherichia coli mutant strain, suggesting that 7H-pyrido[4,3-c]carbazole dimers might induce a DNA deformation that could be recognized by the E. coli SOS repair system. Thus, the role of symmetry in ditercalinium analogues for their DNA binding, antitumor properties, and bacterial toxicity is investigated in the present study, by introducing asymmetric parameters in their structures. Dimers were either synthesized with an asymmetrical rigid linking chain or made up of two chemically different chromophores, i.e., acridine and 7H-pyrido[4,3-c]carbazole. The asymmetrical dimers remain able to bisintercalate into DNA with high affinities, but a dramatic loss in their antitumor potency is observed. On the other hand, these asymmetrical dimers are cytotoxic for polA E. coli mutants, like their symmetrical analogues. These results show that the symmetry plays a crucial role for the antitumor potency in the 7H-pyrido[4,3-c]carbazole dimers series.","['Departement de Chimie Organique, U 266 INSERM, UA 498 CNRS, UER des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Paris, France.']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)']",['10.1021/jm00400a023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

All patients included in this study were treated using a 60 Co beam to deliver a prescribed dose of 10 Gy to the mid-plane of the abdomen. Total body irradiation was performed the day before B.M.T. The mean instantaneous dose-rate was 3.5 cGy/min (range: 2.6 to 4.7). The real dose received was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (lithium borate). The difference between the doses delivered to the liver and to the mid-plane of the abdomen did not exceed 5%. The mean real dose delivered to the reference point was 10 Gy (range 8.3 to 11.7). Ninety five per cent of the patients received a dose ranging from 9.1 Gy to 10.9 Gy. High-dose cyclophosphamide was given to 126 patients with a ""standard-risk"" of relapse (60 mg/kg on day 5 and 4 before B.M.T.). Chemotherapy was intensified by the addition of other drugs in 25 patients with ""higher-risk"" of relapse. We analyzed the effect of the following pretransplant characteristics on the subsequent posttransplant development of V.O.D.: age, sex, ASAT and/or ALAT before conditioning regimen, diagnosis and status of malignant disease, history of liver disease, interval between diagnosis of hematologic malignancy and B.M.T., conditioning regimen (i.e., classical or intensified) and dose delivered to the liver during T.B.I. Seventeen patients were classified as having clinical V.O.D. giving a prevalence of 11.2%.

There was no correlation between myc amplification or expression and the resistance of the lines to induction of terminal neutrophilic or monocytic differentiation. Therefore, myc mRNA level does not appear to determine the ability of the variant HL60 lines to respond to inducers of differentiation. Flow cytometric analyses of the expression of a differentiation antigen (AGF 4.36) revealed stable negative and positive subpopulations in growing HL60. myc amplification, expression, and inducibility were identical in these subpopulations, suggesting that variation of these traits in HL60 sublines and variants is not due to maturation state differences. myc gene copy number was also identical in transferrin receptor positive (proliferating) and negative (resting) populations.

Peripheral blood lymphocytosis secondary to infection most often shows increased numbers of activated T cells of the suppressor/cytotoxic subset. A few exceptions, such as in pertussis, show predominantly T-helper cells. Although persistent B-cell lymphocytosis is most often associated with neoplastic conditions, B-cell predominant reactive conditions may also occur. Lack of light chain restrictions on B-cell membranes suggests non-neoplastic disorders. Reactive lymphadenopathy most often shows a predominance of T cells with normal to increased T-helper/T-suppressor cell ratios. In addition, normal ratios of kappa/lambda light chain surface immunoglobulin usually occur on B cells of reactive lymph nodes. Benign lymphocytic infiltrates in skin most often show a predominance of activated T-helper cells. Distinguishing reactive from neoplastic dermal infiltrates by mononuclear cell markers can be extremely difficult and may require DNA genotypic analysis. Mononuclear cell markers applied to bone marrow in patients treated for leukemia and other disorders must also be interpreted with caution. The presence of CD10 antigen (CALLA) may herald recurrence of leukemia; however, this determinant is not leukemia-specific and may be found on normal cells. Similarly, lymphoid cells bearing TdT often represent recurrent leukemia, and they must be differentiated from immature nonmalignant TdT-positive cells.

It can, in most cases, be diagnosed correctly on the basis of a bone marrow biopsy specimen, and the diagnosis is supported by the demonstration of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in the leukemic cells. Nevertheless, as outlined, rare ""variant"" cases may pose diagnostic problems, and other lymphoproliferative disorders may have features that closely mimic those of HCL. In virtually all cases of HCL, the hairy cells are of B-cell lineage, representing a relatively mature B cell that is closely related to plasma cells. Treatment of HCL with splenectomy, IFN-alpha, or 2' deoxycorformycin has led to excellent responses in most cases. Much of the progress in our understanding of the nature of this rare leukemia has been made possible through the cooperation of community physicians with referral institutions, or groups of institutions, that are interested in studying HCL. Despite the remarkable advances in the treatment of this disorder over the last 5 years, and the ready availability of IFN-alpha, much remains to be learned regarding the biology of hairy cells, and further advances in therapy still must be made.

For differential diagnosis, the expression of pan-B-cell or pan-T-cell lymphoid antigens and the absence of myeloid/monocyte antigens represent the most useful markers for distinguishing ALL from AML. However, the increasing appreciation of large numbers of patients with clinically significant mixed lymphoid-myeloid phenotypes suggests that rigid classification of acute leukemias into exclusive lymphoid and myeloid categories may be somewhat artificial. In adult ALL, patients with My+ phenotypes (B+sIg-T-My+ and B-sIg-T-My+) have a lower incidence of complete remission and shorter survival times than do patients with My- marker profiles. Preliminary studies in childhood ALL also suggest a correlation between myeloid antigen expression and poor prognostic factors. In addition, children with sIg+ ""B-cell,"" cIg+ ""pre-B-cell,"" and T-cell ALL phenotypes have shorter disease-free survival times than do patients with more common ""early pre-B"" (B+cIg-sIg-T-) marker profiles. Application of immunologic markers in concert with cytogenetic and gene rearrangement studies has led to the identification of novel subgroups of leukemia with distinct clinical characteristics. Future studies incorporating a multiparameter diagnostic approach including immunophenotyping, gene rearrangement studies, and karyotypic analyses should further our understanding of the heterogeneity of acute leukemias, guide the development of new therapeutic strategies, and provide for more clinically relevant classification of these disorders.","['University of California San Diego Cancer Center, La Jolla.']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Isolated from cultured soil organisms, this purine analogue is a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), and is thus selectively toxic to lymphocytes. Early clinical trials showed that high doses of pentostatin caused severe and unpredictable toxicity, but responses in refractory lymphoid malignancies were encouraging. Careful pharmacologic studies led to the definition of a safe and effective low weekly dose, at which protracted ADA inhibition occurs in neoplastic cells. The most sensitive tumor identified is hairy cell leukemia, in which durable remissions are achieved in more than 90% of patients with a relatively brief course of treatment. Other responsive diseases include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and acute T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Response has been seen in acute lymphocytic leukemia, but the higher doses required are substantially more toxic. Pentostatin is valuable for treatment of indolent lymphoid malignancies and may be useful in non-cancer-related lymphocyte research.","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",['10.7326/0003-4819-108-5-733 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grades 2-4 was only 12% but the maximum incidence of graft failure was 15%. A significant increase in relapse cannot yet be detected in acute leukemia but relapse in chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) was substantially above that reported before T cell depletion. The most important predictive factor for relapse in CGL appeared to be slow engraftment. This finding suggests an alternative explanation for the graft-versus-leukemia effect other than a direct attack on leukemia cells. This is that donor T cells may affect the balance of competition between donor and recipient haemopoesis by preventing a rejection reaction to donor stem cells. Recipient leukemic cells would benefit (i.e. relapse) if recipient hemopoiesis gained an advantage. If this explanation were true we would expect extra immunosuppressive preconditioning of recipients to reduce the incidence of relapse, as well as preventing graft rejection.","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Cyclosporins)']",['10.1097/00007890-198804000-00018 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,
