The mechanisms of such resistance, especially those of innate resistance, have not been fully elucidated. We have established vincristine (VCR)- and Adriamycin (ADM)-resistant sublines of human myelogenous leukemia K562 by continuous drug exposure. These resistant sublines contained double minute chromosomes and express a glycoprotein with a 180,000 dalton M.W. Analysis of VCR and ADM sensitivities of several isolated clones from these resistant sublines revealed a tight relationship between these two resistant mechanisms. However, ADM resistant sublines are always highly resistant to VCR, but VCR resistant sublines are not necessarily highly resistant to ADM, suggesting the presence different mechanisms of ADM and VCR resistance. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the drug efflux in these resistant tumor cells, thereby overcoming of drug resistance. Greater potentition was observed with antitumor agents to which VCR- and ADM-resistant cells were highly cross-resistant. Calcium channel blockers always show higher potentiation with VCR than ADM, and the clones with greater resistance to VCR generally accumulated less VCR and generally possessed a higher rate of VCR efflux. These results might indicate that a major mechanism of VCR resistance could be a defficiency in drug transport and this mechanism can be reversed by calcium channel blockers, while the ADM resistance mechanisms are partly related to drug efflux and only this mechanism of the ADM resistance can be modulated by calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers also potentiate the drug effects, especially that of vinca alkaloids, in innately resistant tumors cells, indicating that such innate resistant cells also share a similar resistance mechanism to that observed in acquired drug resistance. From these results, the mechanisms of acquired and innate drug resistance are discussed.","['Tsuruo, T']",['Tsuruo T'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'Vindesine/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;223:203-16.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)']",,,,,,

Retinoic acid is known to induce myeloid differentiation associated with GO arrest in these cells. In this case, onset of terminal differentiation occurs after an exposure period corresponding to two division cycles. This is preceded by acquisition of a precommitment memory state occurring by one division cycle. Cells in precommitment undergo accelerated onset of terminal differentiation upon reexposure to inducer. The present report shows that the precommitment state can be induced by a pulse exposure to hydroxyurea. While the hydroxyurea exposure does not itself induce terminal differentiation, the treated cells undergo accelerated onset of phenotypic differentiation and GO arrest upon exposure to retinoic acid. Thus a perturbation of S-phase specific cellular metabolism induces the early precommitment regulatory state in the course of induced HL-60 terminal myeloid differentiation. The results support a model in which initiation of a cellular program of terminal differentiation depends on an S-phase specific event associated with replication of cellular DNA and possibly involving gene amplification. Significantly, the results indicate that a conventional chemotherapeutic agent such as hydroxyurea can synergistically interact with a differentiation inducing agent such as retinoic acid. This indicates the significance of investigating the interaction between conventional S-phase specific chemotherapeutic agents and differentiation inducing agents as a potential treatment modality.","['Yen, A', 'Freeman, L', 'Fishbaugh, J']","['Yen A', 'Freeman L', 'Fishbaugh J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(1):63-71. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90106-8.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90106-8 [doi]'],,,,

Improved syntheses of both compounds are described. They were administered in drinking water to male MRC-Wistar rats for 1 year, starting at 3 or 9 weeks of age. The HENU-treated rats showed incidences of 48% for bone tumors, 32% for intestinal tumors (mostly duodenal adenocarcinomas), and 53% for lymphoma-leukemia. Of the bone tumors, which were evaluated microscopically and radiologically, 68% were osteosarcomas and 32% were osteoblastomas. The skeletal distribution of these tumors was similar to that of human osteosarcoma, with the tumors occurring most frequently in the lower limbs near the knees. Of the hematopoietic tumors, the majority were lymphoblastic lymphoma-leukemia, which showed a diffuse organ distribution resembling human B-cell (Burkitt's-like) lymphoblastic lymphoma-leukemia, and differed from the usual type of convoluted T-cell lymphoma-leukemia induced by other nitrosoureas in rats and mice.

After 48 hours, the 50% growth-inhibition doses (ID50) of ET-18-OCH3 were found to be 0.78 microgram/ml (HL60), 1.53 microgram/ml (Raji), 4.41 micrograms/ml (K562), and 5.05 micrograms/ml (L1210), as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation.

Since O-alkyl cleavage enzyme previously was suggested as being important in the detoxification of cytotoxic ALPs, the enzyme activity was compared with the susceptibility to ET-18-OCH3 in the distinct cell lines. In comparison to an approximate sevenfold to elevenfold (ID50 and LD50, respectively) difference in the susceptibility of the above leukemia cell lines to ET-18-OCH3, no significant difference in the specific activities (0.13-0.21 nmol/min/mg) of the O-alkyl cleavage enzyme was found in the above leukemia cell lines. Therefore, the differential sensitivity of the above lines investigated cannot be explained by differences in O-alkyl cleavage enzyme activity.

Sixty of the 77 patients who had severe infection were used in the evaluation of effectiveness. The remaining 17 patients were not evaluated because they were subjected to combined treatments of CMX and other therapeutic agents such as other antibiotics, gamma-globulin or interferon. Excellent responses were found in 26 (43.3%) patients and good responses in 12 (20.0%) patients. In total, the rate of effectiveness was 63.3%. Nineteen of the 22 patients who were treated prophylactically with CMX were used in the evaluation of effectiveness, while 3 patients were excluded from the evaluation because peripheral neutrophils were counted to be more than 1,000/mm3 before CMX was administrated, although these 3 patients were used in the final evaluation to examine side effects. In the prophylactic treatment, the rate of effectiveness was 89.5%. The side effects were seen in 4 patients (4/82:4.9%). A different symptom was identified in each patient. These symptoms were skin rash, mild nausea, mild diarrhea and slight elevation of serum bilirubin. Prompt improvements of these symptoms occurred as soon as CMX administration was stopped.

Previous studies showed that sequences encompassing the viral transcriptional signals in U3 are the primary determinant of this phenotype in recombinants between these two viruses. To more precisely identify the sequences responsible, we constructed additional recombinants, within U3, between Friend and Moloney viruses and assayed these recombinants for for their disease specificity. We found that a fragment 191 bases long that included the direct repeat (enhancer) region plus 22 nucleotides to its 3' side from Friend virus was sufficient to convert Moloney virus to a virus that induced only erythroleukemias. A 171-base-long fragment of Moloney virus, including just the direct repeat, converted Friend virus to a virus that induced primarily lymphomas (about 85% of mice injected). We also constructed Moloney and Friend virus variants with one rather than two copies of the enhancer element. These viruses retained their disease specificity, although they exhibited a marked increase in the latent period of disease induction. Together the results suggest that 25 or fewer nucleotide differences, lying within and also just 3' of the direct repeat, are the primary determinant of the distinct disease specificities of nondefective Friend and Moloney viruses.","['Li, Y', 'Golemis, E', 'Hartley, J W', 'Hopkins, N']","['Li Y', 'Golemis E', 'Hartley JW', 'Hopkins N']",['eng'],"['CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-A1-22673/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01-CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 Mar;61(3):693-700. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.3.693-700.1987.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",PMC254008,['10.1128/JVI.61.3.693-700.1987 [doi]'],,,,

There is evidence that flanking DNA sequences can have an effect on virus expression and, conversely, inserted viral DNA may affect the expression of adjacent host genes. As part of our studies on the interaction of inserted M-MuLV with the mouse genome, we have chromosomally mapped four different Mov loci by hybridizing single-copy mouse sequences, flanking the proviral DNA, to interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, these sequences were assigned regionally by in situ hybridization to mouse metaphase chromosomes. In Mov-13 mice, M-MuLV had inserted into the alpha 1(I) collagen gene leading to early embryonic death in homozygotes. We have assigned this locus to the distal region of chromosome 11. Thus, the alpha 1(I) collagen gene is part of an evolutionarily conserved linkage group with the homologous genes on human chromosome 17.

Human erythrocyte (RBC) TPMT activity is controlled by a common genetic polymorphism. On a genetic basis approximately one in every 300 subjects lacks TPMT activity, and 11% of subjects have intermediate activities. 6-Thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) are major metabolites of 6-MP and azathioprine in humans. RBC 6-TGN concentrations are correlated directly with risk for the development of leukopenia in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. Our studies were performed to determine whether there was a relationship between genetically controlled levels of RBC TPMT activity and RBC concentrations of 6-TGN. We found a significant negative correlation between RBC TPMT activity and 6-TGN concentrations in blood samples from 40 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving long-term therapy with 6-MP (rs = -0.474; P less than 0.005). In addition, RBC TPMT activities were significantly higher in blood samples from these patients than in blood samples from adult control subjects (P less than 0.0001) or children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were in remission but were not receiving drug therapy (P less than 0.0001). Finally, three adult patients were studied who developed very high RBC 6-TGN concentrations and thiopurine-induced leukopenia. Two of the three patients had no detectable RBC TPMT activity--presumably on a genetic basis. These results indicate that low TPMT activity may be a risk factor for the occurrence of elevated 6-TGN concentrations and for the development of severe leukopenia in patients treated with thiopurine drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lennard, L', 'Van Loon, J A', 'Lilleyman, J S', 'Weinshilboum, R M']","['Lennard L', 'Van Loon JA', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Weinshilboum RM']",['eng'],"['ES 55110/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 35720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,IM,"['Adult', 'Azathioprine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk', 'Thionucleotides/*analysis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1987 Jan;41(1):18-25. doi: 10.1038/clpt.1987.4.,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",,"['0009-9236(87)91023-X [pii]', '10.1038/clpt.1987.4 [doi]']",,,,

We separated erythrocytes from five blood donors and four patients at different time points after MTX infusions, using discontinuous Percoll gradients consisting of four solutions with a difference of 3% in density among them. The procedure yielded five distinct fractions of erythrocytes of increasing mean cell age as judged by declining reticulocyte enrichment and erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activity among the five fractions. MTX concentrations of the erythrocytes were measured at different times in connection with five 24-h MTX infusions (0.7-4 g/m2) on 14 occasions. Two days after completion of MTX infusion, no MTX was detected in the youngest erythrocyte population in two patients. Seven days after the infusion, the highest MTX concentrations were found in the youngest red blood cells. Ten to fourteen days following the MTX treatment, considerably lower MTX concentrations were found in the young red blood cells, and the MTX-containing erythrocytes seemed to have moved down the gradient.

Twenty-two patients (56%) achieved complete remission (CR), and four achieved partial remission (10%). Seventy-five percent of the patients who had relapsed during treatment and 58% of those who had relapsed after treatment was stopped achieved CR. Eleven patients remain in CR at a median time of 10 months (range, 3-17) after treatment.

The degree of potentiation depended upon the antibiotic concentration. The treatment with 75 microM cadeguomycin for 18 h increased cellular uptake of [3H]ara-C into K562 cells and formation of ara-C nucleotides, as well as incorporation into nucleic acids. The level of the diphosphate of ara-C plus the triphosphate of ara-C was approximately 10 times higher in the cadeguomycin-treated cells than in the untreated cells by 30 min of incubation with [3H]ara-C. The extracts of 15 microM cadeguomycin-treated K562 cells showed increased activity of formation of ara-C nucleotides, resulting in 4- to 5-fold higher formation of the di- and triphosphates of ara-C than the control cell extracts.

Although these studies suggest diverse biochemical mechanisms may be contributing to the bone changes and hypercalcemia seen in childhood ALL, ectopic PTH production as well as ectopically produced fragments of PTH may have a role in mediating bone resorption and hypercalcemia.","['Cohn, S L', 'Morgan, E R', 'Mallette, L E']","['Cohn SL', 'Morgan ER', 'Mallette LE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Parathyroid Hormone/analysis', 'Phosphorus/analysis', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Jan 15;59(2):346-50. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870115)59:2<346::aid-cncr2820590230>3.0.co;2-i.,"['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19870115)59:2<346::aid-cncr2820590230>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],,,,

A careful cutaneous examination, with particular attention to recent scars, may provide the only evidence of relapse in adult leukemia.","['Baden, T J', 'Gammon, W R']","['Baden TJ', 'Gammon WR']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,IM,"['Aged', 'Catheterization', 'Cicatrix/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1987 Jan;123(1):88-90.,,,,,,,

The rate of disease-free survival for 3 years or more ranged from 34% to 75%, depending on each clinical trial. Remission induction therapy always consists of at least vincristine (V) and prednisone (P). L-asparaginase or daunorubicin is generally added to VP therapy. The following central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis therapies were compared: craniospinal irradiation cranial irradiation (either 2400 rads or 1800 rads) plus intrathecal methotrexate, intrathecal drugs (either methotrexate alone or so-called triple therapy consisting of methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside and hydrocortisone) and intermediate- or high-dose methotrexate plus intrathecal methotrexate. These therapies have reduced the incidence of CNS leukemia to less than 10%. The intensification phase was the most variable component of treatment. In order to obtain maximum leukemic cell killing early in treatment, a number of protocols are investigating the use of an intensive consolidation course. An early consolidation study by the Berlin-Munster-Frankfurt group in West Germany achieved successful results. However, intensive therapy for low-risk patients failed to improve the disease-free survival. Further studies will be needed to assess the effectiveness of prolonged intensification for patients having any of the prognostic risk features. The standard duration of therapy varies between 2 and 3 years, but the minimum duration of effective chemotherapy is still unknown. It should be clarified whether a more intensive chemotherapy, can facilitate a shorter duration of treatment.","['Kawai, S', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Kawai S', 'Fujimoto T']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

It is important to note that progress in treatment and cure have been the direct result of formal study of childhood cancers and the development and clinical trial of new treatments designed to improve the response and cure rate. In the experience of the Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG), approximately half of the children with cancer which are registered have hematologic malignancies. By far the most significant of these is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which accounts for 33% of all the cancers registered with the Group. Acute non-lymphoblastic types of leukemia have amounted to 6% of all cancers in our experience, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for another 6% and Hodgkin's disease for approximately 5%. The cancer death rate in children under the age of fifteen years has declined very significantly in the United States since 1950. In 1955 the National Cancer Institute organized the first national cooperative groups in order to develop and test new treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The CCSG was the first of these. The success which has been achieved in treating acute leukemia is remarkable, particularly when one recalls that in 1950 the disease was 100% fatal. The death rate due to Hodgkin's disease has also shown a sharp decline, and more recently, deaths due to non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have also declined.","['Hammond, D']",['Hammond D'],['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

During induced differentiation, total superoxide dismutase activity declined to a level slightly more than 2-fold that of PMN, largely due to a decrease in Mn-superoxide dismutase; CuZn-superoxide dismutase showed virtually no change. Catalase activity declined only slightly (but significantly) to a level 1.3 that of PMN. GSH peroxidase activity fell and then rose back to its original level, remaining throughout differentiation more than 10-fold higher than activity in PMN. GSSG reductase activity declined to a level of 73% that of uninduced cells but twice that of PMN. GSH and GSSG contents both decreased, reaching equivalence to those of PMN. Concurrently, the ability of the cells to generate H2O2 increased 11-fold, a change similar to that previously reported for superoxide production.

A delayed regain of SADA (phase II) can predict the long term evolution of the disease. In this phase (II), a regain of SADA up to values higher than the initial value corresponds to a complete tumor regression.

Myelocytic differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and retinoic acid (RA) resulted in a decrease of the overall phosphorylation, the disappearance of two proteins of 42 and 17 kDa, and the appearance of one new acidic protein of 46-48 kDa.

Examination of mouse and human tissues revealed the presence of prothymosin alpha mRNA in kidney, liver, spleen, normal lymphocytes (predominantly T cells), human T-cell leukemia virus-infected T cells, and myeloma cells (B-cell lineage). Prothymosin alpha mRNA is inducible; upon mitogen stimulation it increased greater than 15-fold above the level found in resting lymphocytes. Similarly, serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells responded to serum restitution with an increase in prothymosin alpha mRNA. Characterization of human genomic DNA by Southern blot analysis disclosed a complicated pattern consistent with genetic polymorphism. These data suggest that prothymosin alpha plays an intracellular role tied to cell proliferation. There is no evidence that it serves as a precursor for secreted thymic peptides.

The same decay products were observed after a brief incubation in vitro. They were in low abundance or absent from cells that were not degrading histone mRNA.

The excess risk of nonlymphoid cancers was present in both sexes, across all age categories, and in every length-of-follow-up interval.

Analysis of the antigen expression by individual cells within the parental and the selected cell populations was achieved by flow cytometry and demonstrated a marked decrease of the leukemia-associated antigen expression on individual cells within the selected subpopulation.

Under test was the hypothesis that tumor target binding by activated M phi s is effected by saturable, high-affinity, trypsin and low temperature-sensitive receptors, whereas target binding by normal M phi s is of low affinity, nonsaturable, insensitive to low temperature and trypsin, and is believed not to be mediated by conventional receptors. The results obtained showed that this scenario was realized only rarely and that each target cell line had its own distinctive binding characteristics. Thus target binding by both unactivated and activated M phi s can be sensitive or insensitive to trypsin and low temperature depending on the target in question. This finding suggests that the binding of different targets is mediated by distinct receptors or different combinations of receptors. Contrary to previous reports, the binding of all targets tested was found to decrease with M phi activation and induction of cytotoxicity, but whatever binding strength that remained was obviously adequate for the manifestation of cytotoxicity. Fractionation of M phi s according to size (and hence maturity) revealed that tumor binding capacity (per unit surface area) increased with M phi size. Although target binding decreased in all M phi fractions after activation, it still correlated with cytotoxic activity and cell size for a given activated M phi population. Thus target binding correlates well with antitumor potential in unactivated Mos and with cytotoxic activity in activated M phi s.","['Lee, K C', 'La Posta, V J']","['Lee KC', 'La Posta VJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cold Temperature', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/classification/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Dec;77(6):1287-97.,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",,,,,,

Both patients had clinical and phenotypic features often found in leukemia with t(4;11)(q21;q23). At initial diagnosis, one patient showed a standard t(4;11) with duplication of the 4q-translocation derivative. The latter finding has been described previously in a few patients with t(4;11) in association with disease progression. By analogy with the Ph1 chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia, duplication of the 4q-suggests that this derivative is the critical recombinant in the t(4;11). The second patient has a novel complex translocation, t(4;11;15)(q21;q23;q21). Analysis of this variant translocation implies that the 11q+ is the consistent chromosome rearrangement in this type of leukemia.

In this work, we have studied a case of T-cell leukemia presenting a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation that was found in fresh leukemic cells taken during relapse, but was absent in cells collected at diagnosis. Hybridization analysis showed that the breakpoint on chromosome 8 was located 3' to the c-myc exon 3. A TcR-alpha-specific original probe (D14S7, Mathieu-Mahul et al., 1985) revealed two differently rearranged patterns in DNA from leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and during relapse. In contrast, the rearranged TcR-beta-gene DNA pattern did not change during the course of the disease, indicating that leukemic cells were clonally related. These data indicate that the chromosome breakpoint in 14q11 is situated in the TcR-alpha locus. These results suggest that translocations t(8;14) involving TcR-alpha and c-myc genes in T-cell malignancies are analogous to variant t(2;8) and t(8;22) translocations observed in Burkitt lymphoma. They also establish that the same types of molecular rearrangements due to a t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation, at first described in T-cell lines established in culture, also exist in vivo and may play a role in the evolution of the leukemic process.","['Mathieu-Mahul, D', 'Sigaux, F', 'Zhu, C', 'Bernheim, A', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Daniel, M T', 'Berger, R', 'Larsen, C J']","['Mathieu-Mahul D', 'Sigaux F', 'Zhu C', 'Bernheim A', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Daniel MT', 'Berger R', 'Larsen CJ']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1986/12/15 00:00,1986/12/15 00:01,['1986/12/15 00:00'],"['1986/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Dec 15;38(6):835-40. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910380609.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,['10.1002/ijc.2910380609 [doi]'],,,,

When the effect of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a typical differentiation inducer, on proliferation of mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells was examined at a constant product of time and concentration (480 nM in 20 days), the continuous treatment with 24 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was the most effective for inhibition of cell proliferation. After 20 days, the cumulative cell number was reduced about 3 X 10(5) times by continuous treatment with 24 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Similar results were obtained when M1 cells were treated continuously with dexamethasone. M1 cells resistant to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 appeared about 25 days after the start of continuous treatment with 24 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. On the other hand, when M1 cells were treated continuously with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and noncytotoxic doses of antileukemic drugs such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and daunomycin, resistant cells did not appear for at least 35 days. A similar effect of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and antileukemic drugs on cell proliferation was observed with the human monoblast-like cell line U937. The survival of syngeneic SL mice inoculated with M1 cells was prolonged more by treatment with both 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and daunomycin than by treatment with either drug alone. These results suggest that continuous treatment with both differentiation inducers and certain antileukemic drugs may be more effective therapeutically than treatment with a differentiation inducer alone.","['Kasukabe, T', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M', 'Suda, T', 'Nishii, Y']","['Kasukabe T', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M', 'Suda T', 'Nishii Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Calcitriol/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dactinomycin/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 15;47(2):567-72.,"['0 (Hydroxycholecalciferols)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,

The fact that sodium butyrate causes reversible alterations in growth, morphology, and biochemistry in many cell systems prompted us to reexamine its pattern of induction of differentiation and to compare it to that of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and hexamethylbisacetamide (HMBA). By the fourth day of induction, a peak in hemoglobin accumulation was reached in the cultures treated with each of these potent inducers. Differences, however, were noted in cultures in which there had been no change of medium for 7 days. Whereas DMSO or HMBA induced cultures reached a stationary stage of growth and maintained a high percentage of benzidine positive cells, butyrate treated cultures resumed active growth and showed a marked decrease in the percentage of benzidine positive cells. However, the actual number of terminally differentiated cells remained relatively constant. The addition of fresh butyrate to 4-day treated cultures prevented the decrease in the percentage of benzidine positive cells. Measurement of [14C]butyrate uptake into the cells showed a decrease in the incorporation of the inducer with time coincident with the decrease in the percentage of benzidine positive cells and of the butyrate in the medium. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cells undergoing differentiation for 4 days indicated that butyrate treated cells, but not cells treated with DMSO or HMBA were capable of active DNA synthesis and growth after removal of the inducers. These data suggest that butyrate, a natural fatty acid, is metabolized by the cells and with time its concentration is reduced to a level below that required to stimulate differentiation. Additional evidence to support this notion are the results obtained with conditioned medium (CM) from induced cultures. CM-DMSO and CM-HMBA retained the capacity to induce differentiation whereas CM-butyrate lost its potency with time.","['Friend, C', 'Zajac-Kaye, M', 'Holland, J G', 'Pogo, B G']","['Friend C', 'Zajac-Kaye M', 'Holland JG', 'Pogo BG']",['eng'],"['CA 10000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Butyrates/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 15;47(2):378-82.,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,

Functional and morphological criteria were used to assess the percentage of differentiated cells which arose from their continuous incubation with different concentrations of each agent over a period of 96 h. All of the alkylformamides, alkylacetamides, and alkylureas tested were found to induce differentiation, regardless of structure. Inspection of the results showed that there was a linear relationship (r = -0.937) between the molecular weight of each compound and the logarithm of the concentration which was required to bring about the differentiation of the greatest number of cells, while viability was generally maintained at greater than 85%. Once established, this relationship was used to predict the potency of several polar solvents which were structurally unrelated to the formamides. For example, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were all inducers of differentiation with a potency predictable from their molecular weight alone. The terminal differentiation induced by all of the compounds was only accomplished by cells which were capable of replication prior to differentiation. At concentrations which prevented a single replication and brought about a fall in cell viability over 96 h, no differentiation was observed. A correlation was observed between the molecular weight of each compound and the logarithm of its concentration to bring about cytotoxicity without differentiation (r = -0.935), and the line was almost parallel to that defining the concentration required for optimal differentiation (slope values of -0.02126 and -0.02288). A poorer (r = -0.6654) correlation was found between the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient and the logarithm of the concentration required for optimal differentiation, when the data for 12 of the polar organic compounds were analyzed. The results suggest that no special structural requirements are necessary for the alkylformamides, -acetamides, -ureas, and related compounds to induce the terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells to granulocyte-like cells, but that the activity of each compound could be predicted from their molecular weight. The concentrations required to induce differentiation were marginally lower than those which were cytostatic or cytotoxic, which suggested that a toxic threat to the cells was sufficient to induce differentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Langdon, S P', 'Hickman, J A']","['Langdon SP', 'Hickman JA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Solubility', 'Solvents/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 1;47(1):140-4.,['0 (Solvents)'],,,,,,

This process involves an intermediate regulatory state, the precommitment memory state, which occurs before onset of differentiation or growth arrest in G0. The cellular processes occurring prior to onset of terminal differentiation can be resolved into early events anteceding development of the precommitment memory state and late events subsequent to it. While it has been suggested that retinoic acid induced early events regulate G1/0 specific growth arrest associated with terminal differentiation, the significance of induced late events is not known. Exploiting the capability of HL-60 cells to undergo either myeloid or monocytic differentiation in response to different inducers, the present studies examine the response of HL-60 cells to the sequential application of myeloid and monocytic inducers prior to onset of terminal differentiation. The results indicate that the precommitment state induced by retinoic acid is not differentiation lineage specific. Sequential application first of retinoic acid, a myeloid inducer, and then of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a monocytic inducer, and vice versa, show that cellular choice of a specific differentiation lineage is regulated by late inducer driven events. The data support a two-step model for induction of terminal differentiation where early events anteceding precommitment regulate growth arrest and late events subsequent to precommitment regulate choice of a specific differentiation lineage. The results are of potential significance to the use of differentiation-inducing agents in chemotherapy. The potential toxicity of prolonged exposure to a single inducer might thus be mitigated by sequential brief exposures to different inducers.","['Yen, A', 'Forbes, M', 'DeGala, G', 'Fishbaugh, J']","['Yen A', 'Forbes M', 'DeGala G', 'Fishbaugh J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 1;47(1):129-34.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,

Deformation of leukocytes in micropipettes indicates the relative rigidity of lymphocytes and blast cells from leukemias in contrast to granulocyte viscoelastic properties, and entry times for lymphocytes in 2.6-4.6-microns channels were 11-151 s but milliseconds in 9.1-micron tubes.

The HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia is a useful model of the phenomenon of maturation arrest, particularly as modulated by inducers that partially restore myeloid differentiation. In this investigation, we report the development of two sublines of HL-60 and the acquisition of two others that are clonal variants of the parent cell line. Each of the sublines demonstrates an altered pattern of differentiation and resistance to one or more of the drugs that serves as an inducer of the parent line. The two cell lines developed in this study, HL-60S and HL-60I, are resistant to arabinosylcytocine (ARA-c); HL-60I is also resistant to PMA. A study of the phenotype as expressed by the granule-associated cytoplasmic enzymes revealed that each subline had a slightly different pattern of maturation in response to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or ARA-c as inducers. The proliferative rate of all sublines was similar. These data demonstrate that the maturation arrest observed in this model is in part reversible.

In the course of this developmental process they express many erythroid-specific markers. In order to investigate the expression of cell surface determinants during Rauscher cell differentiation we generated monoclonal antibodies to uninduced cells. Using an anti-Rauscher cell monoclonal antibody, we have identified a cell surface determinant, designated ERY-1, that is present on normal murine erythroid cells. This determinant is apparently absent from the early progenitor BFU-E, but is present on the more mature progenitors CFU-E and CFC-E. It disappears during erythroid maturation and is absent from the mature erythrocyte. This pattern of ERY-1 expression is exhibited with remarkable fidelity during the erythropoietin-induced differentiation of Rauscher cells.

Uptake of the fluorescent fatty acid derivative, 12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid [P12] by a suspension of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells was analyzed and recorded by the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). A major advantage of the FACS is its ability for measuring the fluorescence of the cells only, without interference by that of the fatty acids dissolved or dispersed in the medium or complexed with serum albumin. The time-dependent fluorescence increase due to uptake of the acid by the cells could thus be monitored and recorded directly without a need for sedimenting, washing and extracting the cellular lipids. This procedure provided an accurate measurement of the kinetics of uptake of the fatty acid into the cells and permitted study of the effect of various parameters such as temperature, glucose, albumin or serum. The results indicated a biphasic uptake of P12 into the cells. The first, a rapid, energy-independent phase, lasted 3-4 min. This was followed by a slower uptake which was directly related to the metabolic utilization of the acid in the cells. This second phase represents the overall process of translocation across the cell membrane, activation to acyl coenzyme A and incorporation into the cellular neutral lipids and phosphoglycerides. When compared to HL-60, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells took up considerably lesser quantities of P12. This was utilized for setting up a model system, in which mixtures of these two respective cell types could be identified and separated from each other on the basis of their relative rates of uptake of the fluorescent fatty acid.","['Nahas, N', 'Fibach, E', 'Giloh, H', 'Gatt, S']","['Nahas N', 'Fibach E', 'Giloh H', 'Gatt S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lauric Acids/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice']",1987/01/13 00:00,1987/01/13 00:01,['1987/01/13 00:00'],"['1987/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Jan 13;917(1):86-91. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(87)90287-6.,"['0 (Lauric Acids)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)']",,"['0005-2760(87)90287-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(87)90287-6 [doi]']",,,,

The similar relative synthesis values using different labeling times, plus evidence presented that the total tRNA population decays homogeneously (t 1/2 = 110 h) indicate that tRNAMet1 has a cytoplasmic stability similar to the general tRNA population, and that its concentration relative to the tRNA population is established within the nucleus or soon after exiting the nucleus.

Evaluation of cell size by morphology and volume measurements.,469-78,"The peripheral blood WBC size distribution was assessed by morphological and volume measurements in 73 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL). Patients with typical CLL, with less than or equal to 10% prolymphocytes, had a homogeneous major population of small cells which could be recognized both by morphology and volume (median volume 211.5 +/- 32.5 fl). In PLL, the volume of the main cell component was significantly larger than in CLL: in two-thirds of cases the major cell population was distributed in a first lognormal fitted curve of the volume histogram, with median volume 281.8 +/- 38.0 fl; in the remaining cases the main cell component showed a larger median volume (353.5 +/- 71.9 fl) contained within the second lognormal curve which was preceded by a minor peak. CLL patients with 11-55% prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) had characteristic cell volume histograms in which two lognormal curves could always be fitted: in 80% of cases the main cell component was located in a first curve with median volume of 257.9 +/- 28.6 fl; in the remaining cases the major population was represented by cells with median volume of 349.0 +/- 83.9 fl distributed in a second peak. Although in both CLL and CLL/PL the majority of cells was defined morphologically as small, the median volume of these lymphocytes was significantly larger in CLL/PL. The degree of concordance in the assessment of cell size between morphology and volume measurements was high in CLL, whereas in CLL/PL and PLL morphology underestimated the cell size of the major population, compared with its actual volume, in over 50% of cases. We conclude that the identification of prolymphocytes as larger cells in blood films may be hampered by distortions and artefacts of spreading. Volume measurements may provide a more objective indicator of the cell populations in this group of disorders.","['Melo, J V', 'Wardle, J', 'Chetty, M', 'England, J', 'Lewis, S M', 'Galton, D A', 'Catovsky, D']","['Melo JV', 'Wardle J', 'Chetty M', 'England J', 'Lewis SM', 'Galton DA', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/diagnosis', 'Lymphocytes/pathology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Nov;64(3):469-78. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02202.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02202.x [doi]'],,,,

The first 63 patients entered into the study received initial treatment which comprised four cycles of adriamycin and vincristine, prednisolone and L-asparaginase with the first cycle (OPAL). In 1978, six cycles were given, with escalating doses of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide from cycle 3 (HEAV'D). Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis incorporated intrathecal methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside with cranial irradiation. Maintenance chemotherapy consisted of 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate for 3 years. Results obtained with the OPAL and HEAV'D regimens were not significantly different. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 66% (73/111), factors correlating unfavourably with achievement of CR being advanced age (P less than 0.001) and L3 morphology/B-ALL immunophenotype (P less than 0.01). Fifty-three patients have relapsed, the bone marrow being the primary site in 43. Extramedullary relapse alone occurred in 10 (seven CNS, two testicular and one skin). Only three of the 64 patients who had complete CNS prophylaxis subsequently relapsed in the CNS as an isolated site. One patient died in CR, 19 remain in continuous CR between 2.5 and 10.5 years. The median duration of remission of the 73 patients who achieved CR was 18.5 months, factors correlating favourably with duration of CR being low blast cell count at presentation (P less than 0.002) and common ALL immunophenotype (P less than 0.04).

Chloroquine also enhanced the cytotoxic activity of vincristine, daunorubicin and doxorubicin and, to a lesser extent, teniposide (VM-26) in the CEM/VLB100 cells. Histological examination revealed that the vinblastine-resistant cells contained more cytoplasmic vacuoles than their drug-sensitive counter-parts. When the CEM/VLB100 cells were treated with chloroquine, vinblatine, or a combination of the two, the cells displayed many more cytoplasmic vacuoles than the controls. Coincident with the increased number of vacuoles, these treated cells stained more intensely than controls for the lysosomal enzyme, acid phosphatase, but not for lipid. The vacuolization did not increase as much in the CCRF-CEM cell line when these cells were exposed to the chloroquine + vinblastine combination. Vacuolization was also associated with vincristine, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin treatments, but not with VM-26.

To investigate whether or not these abnormalities persist, we restudied nine patients, all of whom had received radiotherapy and a minimum of 3 years of systemic chemotherapy. Therapy had been discontinued a median of 3.9 years prior to study in our first report and a median of 7.2 years prior to study in this follow-up report. Thirty metaphases from short-term cultures of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood from each of nine patients and nine matched controls were analyzed using G-banding. Nonclonal chromosome abnormalities were present in cells from six of the nine patients and 3.0% of patients' cells overall, as compared to seven of ten patients and 3.5% of patients' cells in the earlier study. All patients studied twice had abnormalities on one or both occasions. No evidence for the development of cytogenetically abnormal clones was found. Combined data from the two evaluations indicate that all of the patients have a small population of long-lived lymphocytes with nonclonal chromosome abnormalities, the frequency of these cells appears to remain remarkably constant over time, and the proportion of cells with chromosome abnormalities is approximately threefold greater in patients than in controls. It has become apparent that survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are at increased risk for development of second malignant neoplasms. The relationship between therapy-induced chromosome damage and the development of second malignant neoplasms is currently unknown. We speculate that some cells, possibly in tissues other than peripheral blood, are preneoplastic by virtue of therapy-induced chromosome rearrangements involving critical genes and, following a long latent period, may undergo subsequent genetic or cellular changes that result in malignant transformation. Unfortunately, however, estimation of genetic damage through cytogenetic studies of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes does not appear to be a useful method for prediction of second malignant neoplasms following acute lymphoblastic leukemia, since most or all of the patients have a low level of abnormal cells.","['Rubin, C M', 'Robison, L L', 'Nesbit, M E Jr', 'Arthur, D C']","['Rubin CM', 'Robison LL', 'Nesbit ME Jr', 'Arthur DC']",['eng'],"['CA07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1986/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1986;14(6):295-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950140602.,,,['10.1002/mpo.2950140602 [doi]'],,,,

During a four-month period, we observed 3 cases of ET that had transformed into leukemia. Two patients had been treated with uracil mustard: One developed acute myelogenous leukemia 79 months after institution of therapy, and the other patient developed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 24 months after the start of therapy. The third patient had been treated with busulfan, and ET evolved into myelofibrosis and eventually into acute undifferentiated leukemia with myelofibrosis. The patient who developed acute myelogenous leukemia was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of ET but was treated because his platelet count was greater than 1,000,000/mm3. He died 1 month after leukemic transformation, during induction chemotherapy. The other 2 patients presented with symptoms referable to their thrombocythemia. Review of the English literature revealed 12 other definite or probable cases of ET with leukemic transformation, all but 1 having been treated with alkylating agents and/or 32P. We propose that the natural history of ET may be similar to that of polycythemia vera, with evolution into leukemia being an unusual occurrence except in the setting of previous chemotherapy. Therefore, the current practice of treating asymptomatic patients with ET may not be justified, since administration of alkylating agents or 32P may increase the risk of subsequent development of leukemia.","['Sedlacek, S M', 'Curtis, J L', 'Weintraub, J', 'Levin, J']","['Sedlacek SM', 'Curtis JL', 'Weintraub J', 'Levin J']",['eng'],['HL-31035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Uracil Mustard/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1986 Nov;65(6):353-64. doi: 10.1097/00005792-198611000-00001.,"['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'W7KQ46GJ8U (Uracil Mustard)']",,['10.1097/00005792-198611000-00001 [doi]'],,,,

Using this assay, which makes possible separate determination of effector-target cell binding and target lysis, we demonstrated that, in addition to lytic capacity, target-effector cell binding is also increased by preincubating NK with 100 to 1,000 IU interferon alpha 2 per 10(6) cells.

Introduction of the 10-hydroxy function with base, triethyl phosphite, and molecular oxygen affords six products. These include the desired epimeric 10-acetyl-7,8,10-trihydroxyxantho[2,3-f]tetralins in addition to products resulting from novel valence tautomerism and cycloreversion reactions in the oxidation reaction. Glycosidic coupling to the fully functionalized cis-8,10-dihydroxy epimer of the aglycon to protected chlorodaunosamine by a modified Koenigs-Knorr method proceeded satisfactorily. By contrast the epimeric trans-8,10-dihydroxy compound failed to undergo coupling under these conditions. This is attributed to facile competing intramolecular hemiketal formation in the latter case. The new angular glycosides are very resistant to electrochemical reduction and display very low (3-10%) augmentation of hepatic microsomal oxygen consumption relative to doxorubicin. The observed, albeit low, cytotoxicity against leukemia L1210 in cell culture provides an additional example where the presence of the quinone moiety in the parent anthracyclines, which is implicated in the clinical cardiotoxicity, may not be necessary for the expression of anticancer properties.","['Lown, J W', 'Sondhi, S M', 'Plambeck, J A']","['Lown JW', 'Sondhi SM', 'Plambeck JA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Chromogenic Compounds/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Glycosides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Naphthacenes/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Naphthalenes/*chemical synthesis', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Xanthenes/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 Nov;29(11):2235-41. doi: 10.1021/jm00161a018.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Chromogenic Compounds)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Xanthenes)']",,['10.1021/jm00161a018 [doi]'],,,,

Because gallium has therapeutic potential, the effects of transferrin-gallium on leukemic cell proliferation, transferrin receptor expression, and cellular iron utilization were studied. The cytotoxicity of gallium is considerably enhanced by its binding to transferrin and cytotoxicity can be reversed by transferrin-iron but not by other transferrin forms. Exposure to transferrin-gallium leads to a marked increase in cell surface transferrin binding sites, but despite this, cellular 59Fe incorporation is inappropriately low. Although shunting of transferrin-gallium to another cellular compartment has not been ruled out, other studies suggest that transferrin-gallium impairs intracellular release of 59Fe from transferrin by interfering with processes responsible for intracellular acidification. These studies, taken together, demonstrate that inhibition of cellular iron incorporation by transferrin-gallium is a prerequisite for inhibition of cellular proliferation.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Seligman, P A']","['Chitambar CR', 'Seligman PA']",['eng'],['AM-27039/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Copper/pharmacology', 'Ferritins/analysis', 'Gallium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*analysis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Transferrin/immunology/*pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 Dec;78(6):1538-46. doi: 10.1172/JCI112746.,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",PMC423914,['10.1172/JCI112746 [doi]'],,,,

In the present study, we investigated the activity of CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase, which catalyzes the synthesis of GM3 ganglioside from lactosylceramide, in cells undergoing differentiation induced by two different reagents, TPA and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, which induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into the monocyte/macrophage lineage through different modes of action.

In this report, we have selected a stable HEL subclone with increased expression of glycoprotein (GP) Ib as assessed by 6 different monoclonal antibodies in order to investigate the biochemical characteristics of this glycoprotein. A single polypeptide chain of apparent Mr = 60,000 was precipitated under reducing and nonreducing conditions by a specific polyclonal anti-platelet glycocalicin antibody and two anti-GPIb alpha monoclonal antibodies (AN51 and AP1), both from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled HEL cells. We were unable to demonstrate the presence of a polypeptide corresponding to the beta subunit of GPIb or GPIX which is closely associated with GPIb. Competitive immunoprecipitation performed in the presence of an excess amount of cold platelet glycocalicin completely displaced the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide. Synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide chains on this Mr = 60,000 polypeptide was inhibited by the antibiotic tunicamycin, and a shift of the apparent Mr from 60,000 to 48,000 was observed. O-Linked oligosaccharide chains identical to platelet GPIb hexasaccharides were deficient or incomplete since no peanut agglutinin binding to the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide was observed after neuraminidase treatment of HEL cells. Thus, our results provide evidence that the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide expressed on the surface membrane of HEL cells is closely related to platelet GPIb and corresponds to an incompletely or abnormally O-glycosylated GPIb alpha subunit.","['Kieffer, N', 'Debili, N', 'Wicki, A', 'Titeux, M', 'Henri, A', 'Mishal, Z', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Clemetson, K J']","['Kieffer N', 'Debili N', 'Wicki A', 'Titeux M', 'Henri A', 'Mishal Z', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W', 'Clemetson KJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Asialoglycoproteins/immunology', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligosaccharides/analysis', '*Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology/metabolism', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1986/12/05 00:00,1986/12/05 00:01,['1986/12/05 00:00'],"['1986/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Dec 5;261(34):15854-62.,"['0 (Asialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (glycocalicin)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",,['S0021-9258(18)66642-6 [pii]'],,,,

The metabolite purification and elution positions on these columns were followed by radioactivity and their ultraviolet absorption at 310 nm. The two metabolites have been unequivocally identified as (5Z)- and (5E)-19-nor-10-oxo-25-hydroxycholecalciferol by ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometry and co-chromatography with synthetic compounds on a high-performance liquid chromatograph.

Experiments with methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme that synthesizes adenosylmethionine) showed little effect of selenite on the activity of this enzyme in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, FELC are able to synthesize S-adenosylmethionine in the presence of sodium selenite.

In the presence of selenite, DNA methylase is very sensitive to selenite inhibition, but removal of the selenite restores activity. However, DNA synthesized by FELC grown in the presence of selenite (no DNA methylase activity) was found to be hypomethylated.

Fetal bovine serum and CM contain specific differentiation-inducing factors that, in conjunction with the drugs, bring about cell maturation. To examine the mechanism by which this interactive effect occurs, ML-1 cells were exposed to actinomycin D or daunomycin in various combinations with CM, using concentrations at which neither the drug nor CM, when applied individually, induced maturation to a significant extent. Pretreatment for 3 days with drug followed by treatment for 3 days with CM caused maturation of 75% of the cells, as determined by the appearance of Fc receptors. Other markers of differentiation, including alpha-napthyl acetate esterase, acid phosphatase, and morphology, also reflected the increase in maturation. The simultaneous application of drug and CM was equally effective in inducing differentiation. Pretreatment of the cells with CM followed by treatment with drug failed to induce maturation, whereas pretreatment with CM followed by a second application of CM caused the expression of Fc receptors in 62% of the cells. In contrast, pretreatment with drug followed by a second application of drug did not induce differentiation significantly. These results indicate that the drug sensitizes the cells to respond to concentrations of CM to which they would otherwise be refractive. The drug-induced sensitization is reversible. At sensitizing drug concentrations, cell viability was preserved but, as measured by radiolabeling for 1 h, total RNA synthesis was decreased by 38% and mRNA synthesis by 87%. At these drug concentrations, the synthesis of mRNA specified by all seven oncogenes examined (myb, myc, abl, fos, N-ras, sis, erb B) was decreased by 15-60%. The administration of CM subsequent to drug caused a further decrease of some mRNA levels (c-myb, c-myc) but increased the level of others (c-fos). The drug-induced lowering of mRNA levels is considered to inhibit the synthesis of proteins specifically required for G1-S transit and maintenance of the proliferation program, amplifying, thereby, the maturation signal emitted by the differentiation factors present in serum and in CM. As a result, expression of the maturation program is initiated.","['Honma, Y', 'Honma, C', 'Bloch, A']","['Honma Y', 'Honma C', 'Bloch A']",['eng'],['CA-36241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;46(12 Pt 1):6311-5.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,

In this study the effect of low, physiological concentrations of hypoxanthine on thiopurine cytotoxicity was examined in the HL-60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Initially the effect of cell concentration on medium hypoxanthine levels was investigated. When 10(5) to 10(6) cells/ml were used, medium hypoxanthine concentrations fell to undetectable (less than 0.1 microM) levels by 24 h, due to cell utilization. However, when the cell density was reduced to 10(3) cells/ml, it was possible to maintain a medium hypoxanthine level as low as 0.5 microM for 24 h without significant hypoxanthine depletion. This allowed for the investigation of the extent to which physiological concentrations of hypoxanthine (1.0 to 10 microM) could modulate thiopurine cytotoxicity. HL-60 cells were incubated in medium containing from 1.0 to 100 microM hypoxanthine concentrations and varying levels of thioguanine or mercaptopurine for 24 h. Cells were then washed and cloned in soft agar. Physiological concentrations of hypoxanthine (1.0 to 10 microM) provided significant protection to HL-60 cells from the cytotoxic effects of both thioguanine and mercaptopurine. An increase in medium hypoxanthine level from 1.0 to 3.0 microM resulted in a 3-fold increase in the thiopurine concentration required to kill 50% of cells. There was a linear relationship between the thiopurine concentration required to reduce clonogenic survival by 50% and medium hypoxanthine level over the hypoxanthine concentrations studied. Although thioguanine was 200-fold more potent than mercaptopurine, and an analogue of guanine rather than hypoxanthine, there was a similar degree of modulation of the cytotoxicity of both agents by hypoxanthine. These results indicate that low, physiological hypoxanthine concentrations can significantly modulate thiopurine cytotoxicity and suggest that endogenous hypoxanthine pools may have an important effect on the clinical activity of thioguanine and mercaptopurine.","['Zimm, S', 'Johnson, G E', 'Poplack, D G']","['Zimm S', 'Johnson GE', 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;46(12 Pt 1):6286-9.,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,

Proliferation of HL-60 cells incubated in calcium-free medium was inhibited without cell differentiation.

Both calcium-free medium and 100 microM verapamil enhanced HL-60 cell differentiation after treatment with 1 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1 nM beta-all-trans-retinoic acid, or 0.75% dimethyl sulfoxide.

The free cytosolic calcium concentration was measured by the intracellularly trappable fluorescent calcium indicator, quin 2. The increase of intracellular calcium induced by 250 nM ionomycin was completely blocked by 100 microM verapamil in calcium-free medium, suggesting that the high concentration of verapamil (100 microM) blocks the intracellular calcium mobilization in HL-60 cells. Therefore, the enhancing effect of calcium deprivation or verapamil of HL-60 cell differentiation seemed to be closely related to the inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization. This speculation is supported by the finding that 50 microM 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate, an intracellular calcium antagonist, also enhanced HL-60 cell differentiation induced by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, beta-all-trans-retinoic acid, or dimethyl sulfoxide.","['Okazaki, T', 'Mochizuki, T', 'Tashima, M', 'Sawada, H', 'Uchino, H']","['Okazaki T', 'Mochizuki T', 'Tashima M', 'Sawada H', 'Uchino H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Gallic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;46(12 Pt 1):6059-63.,"['0 (Ethers)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '57818-92-5 (8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,

The synergism achieved by the AmB-actinomycin combination was accompanied by an AmB-induced increase in uptake of actinomycin D by the HL-60 cells, whereas the synergism of the AmB-1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea combination could be linked to potentiation by 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea of AmB-induced oxidative injury. These results indicate that the synergism of these two drug combinations was caused by different mechanisms.","['Vertut-Croquin, A', 'Brajtburg, J', 'Medoff, G']","['Vertut-Croquin A', 'Brajtburg J', 'Medoff G']",['eng'],"['AI07172/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI16228/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amphotericin B/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Dactinomycin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lomustine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Potassium/analysis', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;46(12 Pt 1):6054-8.,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,

Protein kinase C activity was evaluated using an in vitro assay measuring histone phosphorylation in the cytosolic and detergent extracted particulate fractions obtained after disrupting cells that had been cultured previously under varying conditions. Depriving cells of serum for 2-3 days resulted in a time-dependent decrease in protein kinase C activity of the particulate fraction. The addition of as little as 0.5-1% fetal bovine serum to serum-deprived cells increased protein kinase C in the particulate fraction by up to 2- to 3-fold. In contrast lipoprotein-deficient serum did not mimic the effect of whole serum. However addition of high or low density lipoproteins to cells grown in lipoprotein-deficient serum or serum-free medium produced a concentration-dependent 2- to 3-fold increase in particulate protein C kinase activity. The maximal lipoprotein effect was similar to that observed with 5% fetal bovine serum and the concentrations of lipoproteins needed to increase protein kinase C activity were in the physiological range. Adherence to plastic was used as a marker of the differentiated phenotype. Cells cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum did not differentiate in response to phorbol ester stimulation as well as cells cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum. These results suggest that serum lipoproteins modulate protein kinase C localization and the response to phorbol ester stimulation in the U937 cell.,"['Ways, D K', 'Dodd, R C', 'Gwynne, J T', 'Earp, H S']","['Ways DK', 'Dodd RC', 'Gwynne JT', 'Earp HS']",['eng'],"['AM 07366/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 31683/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL20160/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lipoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;46(12 Pt 1):6049-53.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,

Surface immunoglobulins (SIg) were found on less than 12% of cells, and T-cell markers were absent. In five cases, one or two stem lines with highly abnormal modal DNA content were found to coexist with diploid blasts. The 3H-TdR LI was high (8.5%-15.5%). Abnormal cell lines, after being cleared by chemotherapy, were found again at relapse. Additional cell lines appeared during the course of the disease in one patient, having different sensitivity to cytostatics.

In this study, we confirmed previous reports indicating the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in murine erythroleukemia cells and examined the mechanism(s) by which steroids block commitment. Untreated murine erythroleukemia cells contain dexamethasone receptors which decrease in number during DMSO-induced cell differentiation. When steroids of different classes (estrogenic, androgenic, glucocorticoid) were tested for inhibition of commitment and for displacement of [3H]dexamethasone from its receptors in DMSO-treated cells, we observed that the glucocorticoids dexamethasone, prednisolone and hydrocortisone, all blocked commitment and substantially displaced [3H]dexamethasone. In contrast, steroids other than glucocorticoids failed to inhibit commitment or displace [3H]dexamethasone. Analysis of kinetics of dexamethasone binding to chromatin revealed that dexamethasone binds to the nucleus via the receptor and preferentially interacts with active chromatin. Inhibition of commitment by dexamethasone persisted in cells released from this agent and reincubated with DMSO in the presence of another glucocorticoid of similar affinity to steroid receptors; inhibition of commitment, however, was not obtained when cells removed from dexamethasone were incubated in the presence of beta-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone. These data indicate that inhibition of commitment of mouse erythroleukemia cells by steroids is associated with binding to glucocorticoid receptors and may involve interactions of steroids and their receptors with regions of chromatin.","['Tsiftsoglou, A', 'Housman, D', 'Wong, W']","['Tsiftsoglou A', 'Housman D', 'Wong W']",['eng'],"['CA-17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/metabolism', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Steroids/*pharmacology', 'Testosterone/pharmacology']",1986/11/28 00:00,1986/11/28 00:01,['1986/11/28 00:00'],"['1986/11/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/28 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Nov 28;889(2):251-61. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(86)90111-4.,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Steroids)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,"['0167-4889(86)90111-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(86)90111-4 [doi]']",,,,

We also attempted to elucidate the relationship between development of MF and the various clinical and haematological features of CGL. A significant correlation was found between the amount of fibrosis (graded from 0 to 3) and the stage of CGL, indicating that major fibrotic changes are associated with accelerated or blastic disease. Survival studies performed to assess the prognostic significance of the various degrees of MF, showed a progressively worse life-expectancy from grade 0 to grade 3 fibrosis. Multivariate regression analysis indicated Hb level, age, number of marrow megakaryocytes (MKs), time from diagnosis as the features most significantly correlated with the degree of MF. This study demonstrates that the natural history of CGL involves a progressive increase in reticulin deposition towards severe MF, although the rate of this progression varies widely. Monitoring changes of fibrosis with sequential biopsies could give a measure of the rate of progression of the disease and help in prognostic assessment of CGL patients. Our findings also confirm that among marrow features the number of MKs is the cytological variable most significantly correlated with MF.","['Lazzarino, M', 'Morra, E', 'Castello, A', 'Inverardi, D', 'Coci, A', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Magrini, U', 'Zei, G', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Lazzarino M', 'Morra E', 'Castello A', 'Inverardi D', 'Coci A', 'Pagnucco G', 'Magrini U', 'Zei G', 'Bernasconi C']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Oct;64(2):227-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb04115.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb04115.x [doi]'],,,,

The effects of combining MTX and ASP are schedule dependent. To investigate this schedule dependency, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) employed vincristine and prednisone with progressive dose escalation of moderate-dose MTX (125 mg/m2) followed 24 h later with ASP (6,000 U/m2) in refractory adult ALL. We treated 38 patients with refractory or first relapse adult ALL. Most patients had received prior ASP (92%) and MTX (72%). A complete remission was achieved in 25% with a median duration of remission of 21 weeks. The median survival for the entire group was 7.4 months. Therapy was well tolerated and toxicity was acceptable. Our response rate was lower than other tandem MTX and ASP adult ALL trials. Therapy was similar with other series, with the exception of the dose of ASP employed. We conclude that tandem MTX and ASP, in the doses and schedule used here, has only modest activity in previously treated adult ALL.

A collaborative study of the five Nordic Cancer Registries.,1-151,"Time trends and differentials in cancer incidence in the five Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, were investigated, using material collected by the cancer registries in each country. The incidence at all sites combined and at 23 anatomical sites was studied by age, birth cohort and time period. The maximum lengths of the trends were used for each country. In Denmark the material comprised all the tumours diagnosed in 1943-1980, in Finland and Norway those diagnosed in 1953-1980, in Iceland those diagnosed in 1955-1980, and in Sweden those diagnosed in 1958-1980. For males the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates at all sites combined were highest in Denmark and Finland, and lowest in Sweden and Norway. In females the incidence was highest in Denmark and Iceland, and lowest in Finland. The rates increased slightly for both sexes. For cancer of the pancreas, Hodgkin's disease, acute leukaemia and childhood cancer (all sites combined) the rates in all the Nordic countries were similar every year. For cancers of the stomach, colon, breast, corpus uteri, ovary, prostate, testis, urinary bladder, melanoma of the skin and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas the trends were similar but on different levels. For cancers of the larynx and lung in males the rates in Finland decreased during the 1970s, whereas the rates were increasing in the other Nordic countries. For cancer of the rectum, the trend showed a decrease in Denmark but an increase in the other Nordic countries. For lip cancer the rate in Sweden was almost constant over time, but in Denmark, Finland and Norway a decrease occurred. For oesophageal cancer in males the rates decreased in Finland and Iceland in the 1970s, whereas in Denmark and Norway there was very little change, and in Sweden there was an increase in the rates. For cancer of the cervix uteri the rates started to decrease in Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden in the mid-1960s, but in Norway not until some ten years later. The differentials between the countries were largest for cancers of the testis and thyroid, in which the highest incidence was five to six times as large as the lowest. For testicular cancer the rate was the highest in Denmark, for thyroid cancer in Iceland. For both of these cancers the rate was the lowest in Finland. Melanoma of the skin was the cancer with the most rapid increase in incidence with time in all the Nordic countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hakulinen, T', 'Andersen, A', 'Malker, B', 'Pukkala, E', 'Schou, G', 'Tulinius, H']","['Hakulinen T', 'Andersen A', 'Malker B', 'Pukkala E', 'Schou G', 'Tulinius H']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Pathol Microbiol Immunol Scand Suppl,"Acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica.

It has become apparent that some individual cases show rearrangements of both IG and TCRB genes. In an attempt to more accurately define cell lineage we have analyzed cells from patients with B- or T-cell leukemia (n = 26) at various stages of maturation with probes to two additional TCR genes, TCRG and TCRA (encoding the TCR gamma and alpha chains, respectively), as well as the IG heavy chain joining region (IGHJ) and TCRB genes. On Southern blot analysis, the mature T-cell leukemia cells studied had rearranged TCRG and TCRB while IGHJ remained as in the germ line. The mature B-cell leukemia cells studied had rearranged IGHJ with germ-line TCRG and TCRB. These data suggest that, in the majority of more mature leukemias, cells have rearranged IG or TCR genes but not both. In contrast, cells from five of nine precursor B-cell leukemia patients and cell lines from one of four precursor T-cell leukemia patients had rearranged both IGHJ and TCR genes. TCRG and TCRB mRNAs were expressed in the cells of precursor T- but not B-cell leukemia patients studied. The spectrum of leukemia cells studied within the T-cell series permitted an assessment of the order of TCR gene rearrangements. Two of 13 patients had cells with germ-line TCRG and TCRB, 2 patients had cells with rearranged TCRG alone, and the remainder had cells with rearranged TCRG and TCRB. TCRG and TCRB mRNAs were expressed in precursor T-cell leukemia cells, whereas TCRB and TCRA were expressed in mature T-cell leukemia cells. These results parallel observations from mouse studies on gene expression and support the view of a hierarchy of TCR gene rearrangements in T-lymphocyte ontogeny. TCRG genes are rearranged first, subsequently TCRB genes are rearranged, followed by TCRA gene activation.","['Davey, M P', 'Bongiovanni, K F', 'Kaulfersch, W', 'Quertermous, T', 'Seidman, J G', 'Hershfield, M S', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Haynes, B F', 'Davis, M M', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Davey MP', 'Bongiovanni KF', 'Kaulfersch W', 'Quertermous T', 'Seidman JG', 'Hershfield MS', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Haynes BF', 'Davis MM', 'Waldmann TA']",['eng'],"['AI-19938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO400695/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Nov;83(22):8759-63. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.22.8759.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",PMC387011,['10.1073/pnas.83.22.8759 [doi]'],,,,

In addition, induction of differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL 60 and possibly in one case of human acute myeloblastic leukemia by aclacinomycin A has been observed. Our data indicate that aclacinomycin A and related compounds, such as musettamycin and marcellomycin, are extremely potent inducers of differentiation in mouse (Friend leukemia cells, clone F4-6), rat (rat erythroleukemia, clone D5A1), and human erythroid cell lines (K 562 cell line) and that the relative inductive potency of marcellomycin and musettamycin, in general, is higher than that of aclacinomycin A. This potency difference may be due to the presence of a Cl-hydroxyl group in the aglycone of the marcellomycin and musettamycin molecule. Thus, oligosaccharide anthracyclines are a new class of inducers of erythroid differentiation. The high potency of these compounds, the possibility to study structure-activity relationships relative to their inductive potency and the fact that they induce erythroid differentiation in cells of different species as well as granulocytic differentiation in human cells should facilitate the study of basic mechanisms of hemopoietic differentiation.

RNA extracts of DMSO-induced and control cells were translated in vitro in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesizing system. Translation products were analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were analysed by a computer-assisted method utilizing a drum-scanning microdensitometer. Spots were identified by their relative positions on the films and their relative intensity was estimated. One hundred and eighty-one peptides were identified in both the DMSO-induced and untreated control HL60 cells, 31 of which showed differentiation-associated changes in synthesis in vitro. The 11 peptides which decreased in synthesis did so early in the differentiation process, whereas most of the 20 peptides which increased did so at a later time. Three peptides were shown to increase more than 8-fold by day 4 of induction.

Therefore, we searched for common integration sites by constructing a genomic library from a myeloblastic cell line harboring only five integrated proviruses.

The two regions, named fim-1 and fim-2, were different from 15 oncogenes tested.

However, results from our laboratory with reticulocytes suggest that the rate of iron uptake from transferrin (Tf), rather than ALA synthase activity, limits the rate of heme synthesis in erythroid cells. To determine whether changes occur in iron metabolism and the control of heme synthesis during erythroid cell development Friend erythroleukemia cells induced to erythroid differentiation by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were studied. While added ALA stimulated heme synthesis in uninduced Friend cells (suggesting ALA synthase is limiting) it did not do so in induced cells. Therefore the possibility was investigated that, in induced cells, iron uptake from Tf limits and controls heme synthesis. Several aspects of iron metabolism were investigated using the synthetic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH). Both induced and uninduced Friend cells take up and utilize Fe for heme synthesis directly from Fe-SIH without the involvement of transferrin and transferrin receptors and to a much greater extent than from saturating levels of Fe-Tf (20 microM). Furthermore, in induced Friend cells 100 microM Fe-SIH stimulated 2-14C-glycine incorporation into heme up to 3.6-fold as compared to the incorporation observed with saturating concentrations of Fe-Tf. In contrast, Fe-SIH, even when added in high concentrations, did not stimulate heme synthesis in uninduced Friend cells but was able to do so as early as 24 to 48 h following induction. In addition, contrary to previous results with rabbit reticulocytes, Fe-SIH also stimulated globin synthesis in induced Friend cells above the level seen with saturating concentrations of transferrin. These results indicate that some step(s) in the pathway of iron from extracellular Tf to protoporphyrin, rather than the activity of ALA synthase, limits and controls the overall rate of heme and possibly hemoglobin synthesis in differentiating Friend erythroleukemia cells.","['Laskey, J D', 'Ponka, P', 'Schulman, H M']","['Laskey JD', 'Ponka P', 'Schulman HM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Glycine/metabolism', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Nov;129(2):185-92. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041290209.,"['0 (Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041290209 [doi]'],,,,

A substantial amount of the decrease in Na+ influx seems to result from a drop in amino acid-dependent Na+ transport. This reduction in amino acid-dependent Na+ influx reflects a decrease in net Na+ influx rather than solely in Na+/Na+ exchange and can account for an appreciable portion of the reduction in [Na+]i seen during differentiation. The drop in amino acid-dependent Na+ influx could not be explained by membrane depolarization but was correlated with a decrease in protein synthesis. Inhibition of protein synthesis in uninduced cells by cycloheximide also caused a decrease in Na+ influx. We conclude that during differentiation the reduction in protein synthesis decreases amino acid-dependent Na+ influx which in turn causes a drop in [Na+]i leading to a reduction in the Na+/K+ pump rate.","['Lannigan, D A', 'Knauf, P A', 'Macara, I G']","['Lannigan DA', 'Knauf PA', 'Macara IG']",['eng'],"['AM 27495/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Onium Compounds/metabolism', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism']",1986/11/05 00:00,1986/11/05 00:01,['1986/11/05 00:00'],"['1986/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Nov 5;261(31):14430-6.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'U9IF5Y5IND (tetraphenylphosphonium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['S0021-9258(18)66887-5 [pii]'],,,,

L., (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2782-2788). In the present study, we have identified the nonphosphorylated precursor to pp17 by tryptic peptide mapping of single proteins recovered from two-dimensional gels. The pI of the precursor, p17, was 5.9, and the apparent Mr of both p17 and pp17 was 18,400 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (one dimension). p17 was shown to be a major cytosolic protein, comprising about 0.5% of steady state labeled protein in that fraction. Both p17 and pp17 were found exclusively in the cytosol (detergent-released SOL) and were not detected in membranes, cytoskeleton, or nuclei. In untreated cells, about 90% of the protein was present in the nonphosphorylated form. Upon TPA treatment, pre-existing p17 was rapidly phosphorylated to pp17. After 15 min, the two forms were nearly equal in quantity. This corresponds to phosphorylation, within that period, of about 0.2% of total cytosolic protein, represented by a single species. The maximum level of pp17 was reached within 1 h, with pp17 exceeding p17 by about 25%. Quantitatively, therefore, the phosphorylation of p17 to pp17 is one of the most prominent early biochemical responses to TPA treatment. Available data indicate that p17 predominates in rapidly proliferating cells, while phosphorylation to pp17 occurs where cell growth is modified by TPA or other agents. Thus, the p17/pp17 system is potentially a major mechanism for intracellular propagation of growth regulatory signals. We propose the name, prosolin, for this prominent cytosolic protein.","['Braverman, R', 'Bhattacharya, B', 'Feuerstein, N', 'Cooper, H L']","['Braverman R', 'Bhattacharya B', 'Feuerstein N', 'Cooper HL']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Perilipin-3', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*analysis', 'Protein Precursors/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",1986/10/25 00:00,1986/10/25 00:01,['1986/10/25 00:00'],"['1986/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Oct 25;261(30):14342-8.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (PLIN3 protein, human)', '0 (Perilipin-3)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['S0021-9258(18)67024-3 [pii]'],,,,

Mouse TNF exerted marked anti-tumor effects in mice injected either s.c. or i.p. with FLC lines 3C18 or 3 gamma R8 resistant in vitro to the cytotoxic effects of TNF. Likewise, mouse interferon alpha/beta had anti-tumor activity in mice injected with these FLC, resistant to the action of interferon alpha/beta or gamma in vitro. The results of histopathologic examination and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of 3C18 FLC s.c. tumors injected with TNF resembled the results previously obtained for 3C18 FLC tumors injected with interferon alpha/beta, although the effects of TNF occurred more rapidly. Injection of mice with antibody to mouse interferon alpha/beta or gamma did not abrogate the anti-tumor effects of TNF in mice injected i.p. with FLC.

In contrast to the good response against CRBC, PMN cells were not lytic in the ADCC assay when PI3 virus-infected cells were used as target cells. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) had low but significant lytic activity against PI3 virus-infected cells in the presence of high concentrations of specific antiserum. NK cell activity against K562 target cells was readily detected in PBL of pigs older than 2 weeks but was not observed with cells from spleen, lymph node or thymus from pigs of any age.

In contrast, when PI3 virus infected Vero cells were used as target cells, NK cells were detected in spleen and PBL, but not lymph nodes or thymus, of pigs greater than one day of age. Similar to the absence of activity to K562, none of the lymphoid cells from fetal pigs had NK activity against PI3 virus-infected Vero cells. The present results suggest that the effector cells that mediate ADCC are distinct from those that mediate NK activity in that cells mediating ADCC develop earlier and are found in different organs than the NK cells.

Maximum fluorescence was obtained with cells incubated in the fluorochrome alone. Subsequent incubation of cells in increasing concentrations of m-AMSA resulted in a gradual decrease in fluorescence. Upon incubation in drug-free medium, the quenching phenomenon was reversible, consistent with rapid exit of m-AMSA from the cells. The novel competitive fluorescence assay for cellular uptake for m-AMSA showed a better correlation to nuclear accumulation of the drug, than to its overall cellular accumulation, which may be important in assessment of cellular resistance to m-AMSA, with possible low nuclear accumulation of the drug. When this competitive fluorescence technique for measurement of cellular m-AMSA concentration was applied in flow-cytometric setting, subpopulations of normal human white blood cells were detected with distinctly different fluorescence patterns, indicating differences in cellular m-AMSA uptake. The potential use of this technique is to detect differences between cell subpopulations with different drug uptake abilities.","['Andersson, B S', 'Beran, M', 'Barlogie, B', 'Van, N T', 'McCredie, K B']","['Andersson BS', 'Beran M', 'Barlogie B', 'Van NT', 'McCredie KB']",['eng'],"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,IM,"['Amsacrine/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1986 Jul;22(7):883-9. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(86)90378-0.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",,['10.1016/0277-5379(86)90378-0 [doi]'],,,,

These studies show that nicotine mainly affects the de novo synthesis of proteins.","['Konno, S', 'Chiao, J W', 'Wu, J M']","['Konno S', 'Chiao JW', 'Wu JM']",['eng'],"['CA 35999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36040/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO 400904/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nicotine/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1986 Oct;33(1):91-7. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(86)90105-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)']",,"['0304-3835(86)90105-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(86)90105-9 [doi]']",,,,

Bone marrow samples obtained from 34 consecutive patients undergoing routine diagnostic bone marrow aspirations for nonmalignant hematologic disorders exhibited nearly a twofold increment in CFU-GM when continuously cultured in the presence of 10(-4) mol/L dCyd. Higher dCyd concentrations were associated with a smaller degree of enhancement of colony formation. In contrast, the growth of leukemic blast progenitors obtained from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were not enhanced by any of the dCyd concentrations tested. Coadministration of 10(-3) mol/L tetrahydrouridine (THU), a cytidine deaminase inhibitor, failed to alter the relative inability of dCyd to enhance L-CFU colony growth. The stimulatory effect of dCyd on normal CFU-GM was not mediated by the adherent mononuclear cell population of the marrow, nor was it restricted to the subpopulation of CFU-GM in S phase at the time of initial exposure. Moreover, treatment of normal bone marrow cells with dCyd at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 5 X 10(-3) mol/L for 24 hours had only a minor effect on the fraction of CFU-GM in S phase. Coadministration of 10(-4) mol/L dCyd was able to reverse the inhibitory effects of several putative regulators of normal myelopoiesis, including leukemia inhibitory activity (LIA), acidic isoferritins (AIF), and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Leukemic myeloblasts exposed to 10(-4) mol/L dCyd exhibited substantial expansion of intracellular pools of dCyd triphosphate (dCTP), demonstrating that inability to metabolize dCyd could not be solely responsible for the absence of growth potentiation in these cells. These studies suggest that supraphysiologic concentrations of dCyd may confer a selective in vitro growth advantage upon normal v leukemic myeloid progenitor cells, and may free the former from the inhibitory effects of several potential negative regulators of myelopoiesis.","['Bhalla, K', 'Cole, J', 'MacLaughlin, W', 'Baker, M', 'Arlin, Z', 'Graham, G', 'Grant, S']","['Bhalla K', 'Cole J', 'MacLaughlin W', 'Baker M', 'Arlin Z', 'Graham G', 'Grant S']",['eng'],['CA-35601-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alprostadil/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ferritins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Tetrahydrouridine/pharmacology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Nov;68(5):1136-41.,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '18771-50-1 (Tetrahydrouridine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",,['S0006-4971(20)79446-2 [pii]'],,,,

However, when the medium containing PGE2 was changed every 6 h during 24 h exposure to cells, growth inhibition became much weaker. Moreover, when the medium containing PGE2 was aged by preincubating without cells at 37 degrees C, growth inhibitory effect of the medium was enhanced with preincubation time, suggesting that active growth inhibitory compound(s) accumulated during preincubation. In culture medium containing fetal calf serum, PGE2 degraded time-dependently and the major product was identified as PGA2 by HPLC. Furthermore, when cells were incubated with the medium containing 60 microM[3H]PGE2 or the same medium aged by preincubation, we observed that the radioactivity was taken up by the cells time-dependently, and identified the incorporated radioactivity as PGA2. This uptake was closely correlated with decrease in viable cell number during incubation. These results suggested that growth inhibitory effect of PGE2 was due to the metabolic dehydration of PGE2 to PGA2, and PGA2, after taken up by cells, exerted cell growth inhibition.","['Ohno, K', 'Fujiwara, M', 'Fukushima, M', 'Narumiya, S']","['Ohno K', 'Fujiwara M', 'Fukushima M', 'Narumiya S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media', 'Dinoprostone', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives', 'Prostaglandins A/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins D/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins E/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Water']",1986/09/14 00:00,1986/09/14 00:01,['1986/09/14 00:00'],"['1986/09/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/14 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1986 Sep 14;139(2):808-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80062-6.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Prostaglandins D)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'K6VT5BDY9E (prostaglandin A2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,"['S0006-291X(86)80062-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(86)80062-6 [doi]']",,,,

Observations on concordance using a simple scoring system.,503-6,"The French-American-British (FAB) cooperative group proposed a simple scoring system in 1981 to improve concordance among researchers and clinicians for the subclassification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) into subtypes L1 and L2. The authors subtyped 50 consecutively admitted patients with common ALL of childhood according to the FAB scoring system to assess concordance among a member of the FAB group (J.B.) and two pathologists (S.S. and C.C.) who are not FAB members. The initial agreement of 66% was unsatisfactory to the authors prompting the critical evaluation of the major sources of disagreement. Concordance was improved greatly by the use of two technics that are logical extensions of the scoring system: performing 100-200 differential cell counts to determine the correct percentages in borderline cases, and using reference drawings that illustrate blasts with cytoplasmic contents of 15%, 20%, and 25% in determining the cell's nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. The authors believe that the criteria explicitly given greater weight by the FAB scoring system (nuclear cytoplasmic ratio and nucleoli) are the most subjective. By following the criteria carefully and resolving differences together at a multiheaded microscope, a concordance of 92% was achieved.","['Childs, C C', 'Stass, S A', 'Bennett, J M']","['Childs CC', 'Stass SA', 'Bennett JM']",['eng'],"['CA-11083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Nucleolus/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification/pathology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1986 Oct;86(4):503-6. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/86.4.503.,,,['10.1093/ajcp/86.4.503 [doi]'],,,,

(1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 4805-4809). To determine whether resistance to superinfection was associated with the presence of vaccinia DNA in the nucleus, DNA from cells at different passage levels was hybridized to a vaccinia DNA probe. Vaccinia DNA sequences were detected in the nucleus of cells of lines that were productively infected with vaccinia. No such sequences were detected in productively infected with vaccinia. No such sequences were detected in productively infected L cells nor in persistently infected cell lines that no longer produced infectious particles but were resistant to superinfection. Although no evidence of integration of vaccinia DNA was observed, differences in the restriction patterns were detected at some passage levels. The presence of vaccinia virus DNA sequences in the nucleus apparently did not affect the size of the provirus, the integration pattern or the expression of the leukemia virus.","['Obom, K M', 'Popple, S W', 'Holland, J G', 'Pogo, B G', 'Friend, C']","['Obom KM', 'Popple SW', 'Holland JG', 'Pogo BG', 'Friend C']",['eng'],"['CA 10,000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13,047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29,262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*microbiology', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1986 Aug;5(2-3):221-34. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(86)90020-1.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,"['0168-1702(86)90020-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(86)90020-1 [doi]']",,,,

However, interferon markedly reduces the self-renewal capacity of acute myeloid leukemic blast cells and myeloma cells. This observation suggested that interferon's ability to prolong rather than induce remissions should be tested. We have studied the ability of interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) to prolong remissions induced by busulfan (Myleran) in patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL). The leukocyte doubling time and remission duration among patients receiving no therapy was compared with the values observed during interferon alfa-2b maintenance therapy.

Sizable clonal B- or T-cell populations, representing greater than or equal to 10% of the pathologic sample, were readily detectable by immunogenotypic analysis in all 103 NHLs and LLs but not in any of the 18 cases of HD. However, extremely minor clonal populations (less than or equal to 1%) were detectable in 3 of 18 cases of HD. We demonstrated that these minor clonal populations do not correspond to Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells since clonal immunoglobulin or T beta gene rearrangements are not detectable in cases of HD containing greater than 25% RS cells. The number of RS cells present in these samples appeared to correlate directly with the pattern of gene rearrangements characteristic of polyclonal T cells. These studies demonstrate that Southern blot hybridization analysis for clonal immunoglobulin and T beta gene rearrangements represents an accurate, objective tool in the differential diagnosis between HD and NHL; that HD is predominantly composed of polyclonal B and T cells; that minor clonal B- or T-cell populations unrelated to RS cells occasionally can be found in HD; and that RS cells do not represent clonal B- or T-cell expansions. Finally, our data preliminarily suggest that RS cells may represent polyclonal T-cell populations.","['Knowles, D M 2nd', 'Neri, A', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Burke, J S', 'Wu, A', 'Winberg, C D', 'Sheibani, K', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Knowles DM 2nd', 'Neri A', 'Pelicci PG', 'Burke JS', 'Wu A', 'Winberg CD', 'Sheibani K', 'Dalla-Favera R']",['eng'],"['CA37165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EYO6337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Oct;83(20):7942-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.20.7942.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",PMC386840,['10.1073/pnas.83.20.7942 [doi]'],,,,

SN6 was tested against a variety of cultured and uncultured human cell specimens by using a sensitive cellular radioimmunoassay. Among the 26 cultured malignant and nonmalignant cell lines tested, SN6 reacted with all of the 6 leukemic non-T/non-B (including pre-B)-cell lines tested--i.e., KM-3, NALM-16, REH, NALL-1, NALM-1, and NALM-6. Of these cell lines, 5 were derived from individual patients with ALL; the remaining 1 was from a patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis. In addition, SN6 reacted with 3 of 3 leukemic myelo-monocytic cell lines tested--i.e., ML-2, HL-60, and U937. SN6 did not react with any other cell lines. A consistent result was obtained with 42 fresh (uncultured) cell specimens derived from individual patients with several different types of leukemias. SN6 reacted with 11 of 16 non-T/non-B (including pre-B)-cell ALL specimens. In addition, it reacted with various myelo-monocytic leukemia cell specimens to various degrees. SN6 did not show a significant reaction with normal peripheral blood cells tested, which included B cells, T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and erythrocytes. However, it reacted with a small population (approximately 1% as determined by immunofluorescence staining) of normal bone marrow cells. The approximate molecular mass of the glycoprotein antigen defined by SN6 was determined to be 160,000 by radioimmunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Only one component of 80,000 daltons was formed upon reduction of the 160,000 molecular mass antigen. Therefore, this antigen is apparently a homodimer of a 80,000-dalton subunit.

These two events were analyzed in a number of human leukemia cell lines, including four cell variants of the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 that exhibit different degrees of susceptibility to PMA-induced differentiation. The phenotype of the differentiated cells was characterized by increased reactivity with monoclonal antibodies against maturation-specific cell surface antigens, increased nonspecific esterase activity, and acquisition of morphological cell maturation. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C activity in each of these cell types revealed that 90% of the kinase activity was present in the cytosolic fraction, with the remaining activity in the membrane fraction. Treatment of the differentiation-susceptible cells with 160 nM PMA resulted, within 5 min after treatment, in a greater than 60% decrease in protein kinase C activity in the cytosolic fraction and a greater than 1500% increase in the activity in the membrane fraction. No such subcellular redistribution of protein kinase C activity was found after treatment of the differentiation-resistant cells. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the process of subcellular translocation of protein kinase C activity, initiated after the binding of PMA to this kinase, is required for the induction of cell differentiation by this phorbol diester.","['Homma, Y', 'Henning-Chubb, C B', 'Huberman, E']","['Homma Y', 'Henning-Chubb CB', 'Huberman E']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Compartmentation', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Oct;83(19):7316-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.19.7316.,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",PMC386707,['10.1073/pnas.83.19.7316 [doi]'],,,,

Patients with HTLV-I-positive neoplasms may respond transiently to traditional chemotherapy, but are not cured. For patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) there is no curative therapy. In retroviruses of different species, viral propagation crucially depends on reverse transcriptase, an enzyme not present in normal mammalian cells and different from mammalian DNA polymerases, making it a target for specific inhibition. Reverse transcriptase has been well conserved through evolution: an LAV isolate contained a 250-amino-acid-long domain, presumably the reverse transcriptase core sequence, which has 21% homology to Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMLV). Because HTLV-III infects only humans and chimpanzees, we substituted murine retroviruses for in vivo evaluation of candidate anti-AIDS drugs after ascertaining similar inhibition in vitro of HTLV-III and MLVs, which were chosen for their short incubation time. The triphosphate of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is incorporated into complementary DNA by retroviral reverse transcriptase, causing premature chain termination. Here we show that chronic AZT treatment of mice infected with Rauscher murine leukaemia virus complex (RLV) prevents infection of splenocytes and development of splenomegaly, and suppresses viraemia if started soon after inoculation. Starting AZT late in the course of disease still leads to significant prolongation of life; anaemia, however is a significant side-effect. By analogy, AZT may have a role in preventing retroviral disease in humans if started early after infection, and it may lead to significant survival gains even if started later in the course of disease.","['Ruprecht, R M', ""O'Brien, L G"", 'Rossoni, L D', 'Nusinoff-Lehrman, S']","['Ruprecht RM', ""O'Brien LG"", 'Rossoni LD', 'Nusinoff-Lehrman S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Anemia/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rauscher Virus/drug effects', 'Splenomegaly/prevention & control', 'Thymidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virus Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Zidovudine']",1986/10/02 00:00,1986/10/02 00:01,['1986/10/02 00:00'],"['1986/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1986 Oct 2-8;323(6087):467-9. doi: 10.1038/323467a0.,"['4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,['10.1038/323467a0 [doi]'],,,,

We found that monocytes also produce factor(s) that induce differentiation of human myelogenous leukaemia cell lines to cells with macrophage-like characteristics. This factor(s) has activity different from that of colony-stimulating factor(s) or interferons. We have now purified a DIF to homogeneity from medium conditioned by PHA-stimulated leukocytes using a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, ML-1, as target cells. The purified DIF has a relative molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 17,000, with an NH2-terminal sequence the same as that of human tumour necrosis factor (TNF).

This is in contrast to cisplatin, another divalent alkylating agent in which the half-life of the crosslinks appears to be much shorter and in which washing and resuspension in fresh unsupplemented medium permits recovery of ability to replicate and to synthesize hemoglobin in the presence of Me2SO. The data supports the idea that the presence of single stranded breaks in DNA are required for induction of hemoglobin synthesis.","['Gabelman, N']",['Gabelman N'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(9):1151-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90061-5.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90061-5 [doi]'],,,,

In the past, concerns have been raised about development of septicemia secondary to diagnostic or therapeutic instrumentation. In only 4 of 54 cases did the clinical course clearly suggest digital examination or instrumentation of the rectum may have caused bacteremia though 13 of 54 patients had positive blood cultures for gram negative organisms at some time during their course of which 7 were clearly coliform. Most (42/54) patients were treated initially by sitz baths, suppositories, and stool softeners and/or antibiotics. We observed five patients only and treated two by radiotherapy. Eleven patients required surgical intervention for thrombosed hemorrhoids and perirectal abscess and/or fistulas. Eight other patients with PA/F drained spontaneously. Poor healing after surgical or spontaneous drainage was documented in only one case. This study suggests that sitz baths, suppositories, antibiotics, and judicious surgical drainage (where needed) form the core of therapy for these patients.","['Boddie, A W Jr', 'Bines, S D']","['Boddie AW Jr', 'Bines SD']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,IM,"['Abscess/complications/therapy', 'Hemorrhoids/complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Rectal Diseases/*complications/therapy', 'Rectal Fistula/complications/therapy']",1986/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1986 Sep;33(1):53-6. doi: 10.1002/jso.2930330115.,,,['10.1002/jso.2930330115 [doi]'],,,,

Two concentrations were given to rats, 6,500 and 3,300 ppm (wt/vol). Male mice received 13,000 and 6,500 ppm, while female mice were given three concentrations, 25,000, 13,000, and 6,500 ppm. Each treatment group consisted of 50 or 52 male and 50 or 52 female rats or mice, except 47 male mice treated with the highest dose and 41 female mice treated with the highest dose, and there was a group of untreated controls of each species. Survival and weight gain were similar to those of controls at the lowest cyclohexanone dose in both sexes of both species, but weight gain was depressed at all of the higher doses. Survival was good (greater than 80% at 90 wk) in all groups except in female mice at the 2 highest doses; at 25,000 ppm of cyclohexanone, only 50% of mice lived beyond 1 year. Most of the neoplasms in the treated groups did not differ significantly in number from those in the controls. Male rats receiving 3,300 ppm cyclohexanone had a 13% incidence of adrenal cortex adenomas (7 animals) compared with an incidence of 2% in controls; the incidence of this neoplasm did not increase in the male rats receiving 6,500 ppm or in the female rats given either dose. The mice had a statistically significant increase in incidence of lymphomas-leukemias among the females given 6,500 ppm, but not among the groups given higher doses of cyclohexanone. Male mice given 6,500 ppm cyclohexanone showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, 50% versus 32.5% in controls, but the incidence of these neoplasms was only 37% in the male mice given 13,000 ppm cyclohexanone. The incidence of lymphomas in male mice and of hepatocellular neoplasms in female mice given cyclohexanone did not differ from that in the controls.

The in-unit mortality was 55%, but only 4 patients (18%) survived to leave the hospital. Although the unit mortality appeared to be related to the acute physiology score (APS), this small series did not demonstrate a clear relationship between the APS and long-term survival (discharge from hospital). There were, however, significant differences in the number of organ systems involved between those who died on the ICU and those who returned to the ward, as well as between those who survived to leave hospital and those who died. No patient with more than three systems involved became a long-term survivor. All long-term survivors had either reasonable peripheral white cell counts throughout or their bone marrow showed significant recovery prior to discharge from the ICU. Unresponsive malignant disease and a failure to recover bone marrow function were major factors in those patients who died shortly after discharge from the ICU.

Short-term treatment of cells (1 h) with 5 and 10 micrograms/ml of cis-DDP resulted in a significant inhibition of cell multiplication. Continuous treatment with cis-DDP (up to 144 h) significantly arrested cell growth at 1, 5, and 10 micrograms/ml. The cells exposed to 10 micrograms/ml trans-DDP exhibited a slight decrease in cell multiplication; however, the 25-micrograms/ml treatments showed a modest inhibition of cell growth. Continuous treatment with cis-DDP resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis, although low-dose treatment (0.05 and 0.1 microgram/ml), with a few exceptions, had no relative inhibitory effect. Likewise, trans-DDP treatments decreased tritiated thymidine incorporation; however, this inhibitory effect was not as drastic as with corresponding concentrations of cis-DDP. Scanning electron microscope studies revealed the formation of many giant cells and blebs at all short-term treatment concentrations of cis-DDP past the 48 h interval. Continuous treatment of cis-DDP at 1 micrograms/ml concentration produced giant cells with minute holes, whereas the 5 and 10 micrograms/ml exposure resulted in the formation of blebs and large holes and reduction of microvilli past the 48-h treatment period.

Although the ""potent"" (with respect to DNA damage) derivatives, except 4-demethyl-6-O-methyldoxorubicin, showed an increased cellular drug accumulation as compared to doxorubicin, this did not account for the marked differences in ability to damage DNA. 4-Demethyl-6-O-methyldoxorubicin was the most efficient derivative, producing DNA breaks in a lower range of cellular drug content. A striking biphasic dose-response curve was observed for the 4-demethoxy derivatives, suggesting a complex mechanism of interaction among drug, DNA, and enzyme. A lack of correlation was noted among DNA binding affinity, induction of strand breaks, and cytotoxic activity of these chromophore-modified derivatives. From these observations, it is suggested that multiple actions of anthracyclines at the DNA level are responsible for their cytotoxic activity, which is not simply related to inhibition of a specific DNA-dependent enzyme and/or function.","['Capranico, G', 'Soranzo, C', 'Zunino, F']","['Capranico G', 'Soranzo C', 'Zunino F']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/metabolism/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5499-503.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to characterize the cytostatic, cytotoxic, and differentiation inducing properties of dzAri in HL-60 cells and to investigate biochemical consequences of AdoHcyase inhibition. A dye exclusion test and a clonogenic assay were used to test cytotoxic and cytostatic properties. dzAri had reversible cytostatic effects on HL-60 cells at concentrations lower than 10 microM and partially reversible cytotoxic effects above 10 microM. The induction of differentiation was dependent upon concentration and time of exposure, with maximal effect after 6 days incubation with 5-10 microM dzAri. Washout experiments demonstrated that the cells were not committed to differentiation after 48 h of incubation with dzAri. The AdoHcyase of HL-60 cells was inhibited with a Ki of 20 nM. The concentration of S-adenosylhomocysteine increased dose dependently 48 h after incubation with 0.1-100 microM dzAri. The incorporation of [3H]methyl from [methyl-3H]methionine into 5-methylcytosine of DNA was reduced by 26% at 5 microM dzAri. The findings indicate that continuous presence of dzAri is necessary to induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation in HL-60 cells. The inhibition of AdoHcyase perturbs levels of transmethylation metabolites and the incorporation of [3H]methyl into 5-methyl-cytosine of DNA.","['Aarbakke, J', 'Miura, G A', 'Prytz, P S', 'Bessesen, A', 'Slordal, L', 'Gordon, R K', 'Chiang, P K']","['Aarbakke J', 'Miura GA', 'Prytz PS', 'Bessesen A', 'Slordal L', 'Gordon RK', 'Chiang PK']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5469-72.,"['58316-88-4 (3-deazaaristeromycin)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,

TRF receptor synthesis is enhanced when stationary cells are subcultured at low density in fresh medium. This rise occurs in either the presence or the absence of serum, which is associated with cell proliferation or quiescence, respectively. In the presence of serum, it is not inhibited by the addition of hydroxyurea (i.e., an agent blocking DNA synthesis). Thus, the receptor synthesis is enhanced not only in subcultures of actively proliferating cells (in the presence of serum), but also in subcultures of quiescent elements (in the absence of serum or upon the addition of serum plus hydroxyurea). Conversely, the ferritin content is markedly decreased when stationary cells are subcultured at low density, in either the presence or the absence of serum. These results suggest that stationary cells subcultured in fresh medium undergo a depletion of their intracellular iron pool, which in turn may represent the stimulus triggering TRF receptor synthesis. This hypothesis is supported by two observations: both the depletion of this pool and the rise in TRF receptor synthesis are more marked in the absence than in the presence of serum; addition of excess exogenous iron fully inhibits the rise of TRF receptor synthesis in cells subcultured with fresh medium and serum.","['Testa, E P', 'Testa, U', 'Samoggia, P', 'Salvo, G', 'Camagna, A', 'Peschle, C']","['Testa EP', 'Testa U', 'Samoggia P', 'Salvo G', 'Camagna A', 'Peschle C']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Ferritins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):5330-4.,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,

Exposure of K562 cells to 50 microM DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine for 24 h resulted in a depletion of cellular GSH content to 10% of control values without toxicity. Subsequent 1-h exposure of GSH-depleted cells to activated cyclophosphamide, obtained by incubation of CP with suspension cultures of rat hepatocytes, resulted in a 5-fold potentiation of the cytotoxicity of CP. Alkaline elution analysis of cellular DNA demonstrated that the level of apparent interstrand cross-linking was 3 to 4 times higher in GSH-depleted cells than in nondepleted cells. GSH-depleted cells were, in addition, more sensitive to induction of DNA single strand breaks than nondepleted cells. Depletion of GSH content did not increase cellular sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of phosphoramide mustard. Preincubation of K562 cells with 1 mM cysteine for 4 h resulted in an approximately 60% increase in cellular GSH content, which was accompanied by decreased sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of hepatocyte-activated CP. Exposure of nondepleted cells to clinically relevant concentrations of hepatocyte-activated CP resulted in depletion of cellular GSH content. Replenishment of GSH content in these cells was relatively slow following CP exposure. Acrolein was highly effective at depleting cellular GSH content, whereas phosphoramide mustard had no effect on cellular GSH content. The depletion of GSH by intracellularly released acrolein may be important in the mechanism of cytotoxicity of CP.","['Crook, T R', 'Souhami, R L', 'Whyman, G D', 'McLean, A E']","['Crook TR', 'Souhami RL', 'Whyman GD', 'McLean AE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acrolein/pharmacology', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Biotransformation', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Glutathione/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/pharmacology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):5035-8.,"['0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '10159-53-2 (phosphoramide mustard)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7864XYD3JJ (Acrolein)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,

The median age was 63 years and 64% were males. The overall median survival from time of referral was 14 months; 53% of patients survived 1 year and only 10% survived beyond 5 years. At the time of analysis, 92 patients (88%) were dead, 56% of deaths being preceded by a blastic crisis. Compared with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease, patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia were older and had a significantly higher incidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, monocytosis, marrow blasts, decreased marrow megakaryocytes and a lower incidence of basophilia and thrombocytosis. Chromosomal abnormalities occurred in 33% of patients and consisted most frequently of trisomy 8, or an additional chromosome C, loss of the Y chromosome, or abnormalities in chromosomes #5 and #7. Of nine pretreatment characteristics significantly associated with poor survival, a multivariate analysis identified four to have independent additive prognostic significance: severe thrombocytopenia, hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dl, increasing peripheral blasts and promyelocytes, and age 60 years or older. Monocytosis was not of prognostic significance. The derived prognostic model divided patients into three risk groups, low, intermediate, and high, with median survivals of 36, 16, and 3 months, respectively. The authors conclude that Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia is a distinct entity among the myeloproliferative syndromes with characteristic clinical and laboratory features and a poor prognosis.

A decreased or absent iron in semiquantitative estimation on bone marrow smears was observed in 92% of patients, and 88% had a low sideroblast score. In contrast, normal Hb and serum iron concentrations were found in the majority of cases, and only two out of the 50 patients displayed a decreased serum ferritin. To ascertain whether the bone marrow pattern of iron depletion could be due to an expansion of the red cell mass, the latter parameter was measured by isotopic methods in a subgroup of 11 patients. Normal or slightly increased values were obtained in all cases. We conclude that absent or decreased marrow iron is a common feature in the chronic phase of CGL, that generally does not reflect true iron deficiency. Since such a finding is also usual in polycythaemia vera and idiopathic myelofibrosis, it should be included among the features shared by the chronic myeloproliferative disorders.","['Cervantes, F', 'Rozman, C', 'Piera, C', 'Fernandez, M R']","['Cervantes F', 'Rozman C', 'Piera C', 'Fernandez MR']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Anemia, Hypochromic', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*metabolism', 'Male']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1986 Oct;53(4):305-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00320889.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,['10.1007/BF00320889 [doi]'],,,,

Patients diagnosed as PLL (greater than 55% PROL) had maintained a high %PROL during the period of observation. Serial marker studies in some CLL and CLL/PL cases showed that the percentage of M-rosettes and the intensity of SmIg remained at the same initial levels in all but two cases. These two cases in the CLL/PL group showed a significant decrease in the percentage of M-rosettes and stronger SmIg staining associated with progressive prolymphocytoid transformation.

This report describes an unusual instance of immunophenotypic transformation from an immunologically undifferentiated acute leukemia to a leukemia that at relapse possessed morphologic and immunologic markers characteristic of a Burkitt's-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A 26-year-old man initially presented with pancytopenia and a bone marrow diffusely replaced with blast cells morphologically most consistent with a French-American-British L2 subclassification. The surface immunophenotype of the blasts at diagnosis showed HLA-DR surface antigen but no myeloid, lymphoid, or immunoglobulin determinants. Despite successful induction and ongoing consolidation chemotherapy, the patient had a relapse five months after diagnosis; blast cells at relapse demonstrated marked cytoplasmic vacuolation consistent with a Burkitt's-like L3 acute lymphoblastic transformation. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed the presence of restricted immunoglobulin determinants (mu heavy chain and kappa light chain), as well as two separate B lineage surface determinants (BA-1 and B-1). Immunophenotypic transformations may reflect the presence of either a multiclonal or multipotent leukemic population; documentation of the frequency of such transformations and genomic analysis of the transformed subpopulations may be helpful in furthering the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in leukemogenesis.","['Burck, K B', 'Levitt, L J']","['Burck KB', 'Levitt LJ']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1986 Sep;81(3):551-4. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(86)90314-1.,,,"['0002-9343(86)90314-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(86)90314-1 [doi]']",,,,

Complete remissions were observed in 16 patients (25 percent), and the median duration of remission was three months (range, one to 10 months). Remission rates were similar for patients with acute myelogenous and acute lymphocytic leukemia (24 and 27 percent, respectively). Response rates were significantly higher in patients with initial remission durations of more than six months than in those with shorter remissions or those in whom there was no response to front-line therapy (41 and 9 percent; p less than 0.01). Similarly, patients with disease sensitive to conventional cytosine arabinoside had higher response rates than did those with resistant disease (54 and 17 percent; p = 0.03). Serial in vivo measurements of intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite of cytosine arabinoside in peripheral blasts following the initial dose demonstrated considerable individual variation. Favorable intracellular pharmacology of this active metabolite, manifested by its higher intracellular concentrations 12 hours after the first dose, by longer half-lives of active metabolite levels, and by higher values of the measured area under the curve of its accumulation and retention, was associated with higher response rates. Central nervous system toxicity occurred in 24 percent of patients, and pulmonary toxicity occurred in 22 percent; both were dose-limiting and dose-related. Other toxicities included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, photophobia, cytosine arabinoside fever, skin rashes, and hepatic dysfunction. Response rates were similar for schedules utilizing four to six doses at two-week intervals or nine doses at three-week intervals (27 percent versus 25 percent). The schedule of 12 doses had a more rapid antileukemic effect but resulted in significantly higher toxicity and mortality rates during therapy with a similar overall response rate (21 percent). Thus, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is an effective regimen with substantial toxicity in patients with acute leukemia.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Estey, E H', 'Plunkett, W', 'Keating, M J', 'Walters, R S', 'Iacoboni, S', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Estey EH', 'Plunkett W', 'Keating MJ', 'Walters RS', 'Iacoboni S', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],['CA-32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1986 Sep;81(3):387-94. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(86)90287-1.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,"['0002-9343(86)90287-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(86)90287-1 [doi]']",,,,

Commitment is defined as the capacity of MELC to go on to express the program of terminal cell division and gene expression (such as the accumulation of globin mRNA) upon removal of the HMBA from the culture. In the presence of HMBA, a small proportion of MELC are committed by 10-12 hr and greater than 90% by 48-60 hr. The present study shows that, during the initial 4 hr of culture, HMBA causes a marked decrease in c-myb and c-myc and an increase in c-fos mRNA levels. With continued culture, the decrease in c-myb and the increase in c-fos mRNA persists, while c-myc mRNA returns to control levels before the time that MELC begin to show irreversible differentiation. Dexamethasone, which blocks expression of HMBA-induced MELC differentiation, does not alter the early pattern of changes in protooncogene mRNA nor the sustained elevation of c-fos, but it does inhibit the continued suppression of c-myb allowing c-myb to return toward control levels. Hemin, which induces MELC to accumulate globins but does not initiate commitment to terminal cell division, does not alter these protooncogene mRNA levels. These studies suggest that, although the early decrease in c-myb and c-myc and increase in c-fos mRNAs may be involved in the multistep events leading to differentiation, the continued suppression of c-myb is critical for HMBA-induced MELC commitment to terminal cell division.","['Ramsay, R G', 'Ikeda, K', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Ramsay RG', 'Ikeda K', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Sep;83(18):6849-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.18.6849.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",PMC386607,['10.1073/pnas.83.18.6849 [doi]'],,,,

The cytostatic, cytotoxic, and antitumor activities of these drugs are different, with DHAQ being 10-100 times more potent, per molar basis. Both drugs are strong intercalators and intercalative modes of binding are suspected as relevant to their pharmacological activity. No significant differences, however, that could explain the differences in pharmacological activity are observed in their intercalative properties with respect to base specificity and binding affinity. A correlation, however, is evident between their potency and ability to condense nucleic acids inasmuch as DHAQ condenses nucleic acids at concentrations that are lower by a factor of 5-40 than those of HAQ and these effects can be observed at their pharmacological concentrations. The condensation is base- and sugar-specific and the long purine sequences of single-stranded RNA are the most sensitive. Electron microscopy of L1210 cells exposed a short time (90 min) to 0.21-21 microM DHAQ reveals segregation of nucleoli; the segregated granular portion shows increased electron opacity. In some preparations patchy areas of nuclear chromatin characterized by increased electron opacity can be seen. The results are compatible with the possibility that pharmacological effects of these antitumor drugs could involve condensation of nucleic acids, primarily of RNA in nucleoli.","['Kapuscinski, J', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Kapuscinski J', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']",['eng'],"['CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitoxantrone', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/*drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Sep;83(17):6302-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.17.6302.,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'PNT6041ST1 (ametantrone)']",PMC386491,['10.1073/pnas.83.17.6302 [doi]'],,,,

Irradiated normal mouse bone marrow cells had a rapid increase in the frequency of chromosome exchanges and deletions with increasing araC incubation time, for example, an increase was observed with 0.5 h araC incubation. In contrast, the ML-1 cells did not have a significant increase in aberrations until 1-2 h post-irradiation incubation with araC. These results suggest that the ML-1 cells, per unit time, initially undergo less repair of the X-ray-induced DNA damage that can be converted into chromosome aberrations.

It was observed that the ability to ingest IgA-coated erythrocytes and to bind soluble dimeric IgA accompanied this maturation. Phagocytosis of IgA-coated erythrocytes was greater than 50% inhibited by 0.8 mg/ml free IgA, and not by IgG or IgM. Similarly, binding of dimeric IgA was not blocked by a 100-fold excess of IgG, IgM or IgE. Both IgA-mediated phagocytosis and IgA binding became apparent after two days of culture with calcitriol and increased with time in culture. The induction of functional IgA receptors was evident with 10(-11) M calcitriol and maximal levels of IgA binding and of numbers of cells capable of IgA mediated phagocytosis were induced by 10(-8)-10(-9) M calcitriol. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3, which binds 100-1000-fold less avidly to the cytoplasmic D3 receptor than calcitriol, did not induce functional IgA receptors unless concns of 10(-7) M were used. Other compounds which induce differentiation of HL-60 cells, including retinoic acid and DMSO, produced similar results to calcitriol, whereas cells treated with gamma interferon expressed lower levels of IgA binding and did not ingest IgA-coated targets, suggesting that a critical density of IgA receptors must be reached to enable phagocytosis and/or that other cell activational events are required for IgA receptors to mediate killing. This model may provide useful insight into the function and regulation of IgA receptors on cells of the myeloid series.","['Shen, L', 'Maliszewski, C R', 'Rigby, W F', 'Fanger, M W']","['Shen L', 'Maliszewski CR', 'Rigby WF', 'Fanger MW']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Calcifediol/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Fc/*biosynthesis']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1986 Jun;23(6):611-8. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(86)90097-0.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",,['10.1016/0161-5890(86)90097-0 [doi]'],,,,

Nonpregnant rats receiving pregnant rat serum in twice weekly injections grew tumors only 25-60% the size of those in rats receiving sera of nonpregnant rats. In vitro, pregnant rat sera added to the tissue culture media of rat lymphoma (AS line) or human leukemia (MOLT-4) cells resulted in reductions of viable target cells of 67-71%, respectively.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of new gamma-monoamides of aminopterin and methotrexate.,1703-9,"Lipophilic gamma-monoamide derivatives of aminopterin (AMT) were synthesized in high overall yield from 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroic acid and gamma-N-tert-alkyl-, gamma-N-aralkyl-, or gamma-N-arylamides of alpha-benzyl L-glutamate via a modification of the mixed carboxylic-carbonic anhydride coupling method. Coupling was also accomplished with p-nitrophenyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formylpteroate. Compounds obtained in this manner included the gamma-tert-butylamide, gamma-(1-adamantylamide), gamma-benzylamide, gamma-(3,4-dichlorobenzylamide), gamma-(2,6-dichlorobenzylamide), gamma-anilide, gamma-(3,4-methylenedioxyanilide), and gamma-(3,4-dihydroxanilide) derivatives of AMT. Also prepared, from 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic acid via diethyl phosphorocyanidate coupling, was the gamma-(3,4-methylenedioxyanilide) of MTX. The methylenedioxyanilides were cleaved smoothly to dihydroxyanilides with boron tris(trifluoroacetate) in trifluoroacetic acid. All the gamma-monoamides were tested as inhibitors of purified dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from murine L1210 leukemia cells and as inhibitors of the growth of wild-type L1210 cells and a subline (L1210/R81) with high-level resistance to MTX and AMT based mainly on a defect in drug uptake via active transport. Several compounds were also tested against human leukemic lymphoblasts (CEM cells) and a resistant subline (CEM/MTX) whose resistance is likewise based on uptake. The IC50 of the gamma-monoamides against DHFR was 1.5- to 5-fold higher than that of the parent acids, but the IC50 against cultured cells varied over a much broader range, suggesting that uptake and/or metabolism rather than DHFR binding are principal determinants of in vitro growth inhibitory activity for these compounds. gamma-N-Aryl and gamma-N-aralkyl derivatives appeared to be more potent than gamma-N-tert-alkyl derivatives. Where comparison could be made, AMT gamma-monoamides were more potent than MTX gamma-monoamides. Several of the gamma-monoamides showed potency comparable to that of the parent acid against wild-type L1210 and CEM cells; all of them were more potent than MTX against the L1210/R81 subline; and some of the AMT gamma-monoamides were also more potent than the parent acid against resistant CEM/MTX cells. As a group, however, the gamma-monoamides were considerably more active against the murine cells than against the human cells, suggesting that the former may take up the amides better or may be able to metabolize them more efficiently than the parent acids. All the gamma-monoamides were tested in vivo against L1210 leukemia in mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Rosowsky, A', 'Bader, H', 'Radike-Smith, M', 'Cucchi, C A', 'Wick, M M', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Rosowsky A', 'Bader H', 'Radike-Smith M', 'Cucchi CA', 'Wick MM', 'Freisheim JH']",['eng'],"['CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Amides/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Mice']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 Sep;29(9):1703-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00159a023.,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['10.1021/jm00159a023 [doi]'],,,,

Exposure of wild-type and variant cells to exogenous 2-5A oligomers made permeable with lysolecithin resulted in 50-70% inhibition of protein synthesis. Further, the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus in IFN-resistant 2-5A synthetase-deficient FLC exposed to 2-5A trimer was inhibited to the same extent as in wild-type cells. Last, a significant cleavage of ribosomal RNA was observed in samples of total RNAs extracted from variant and wild-type permeabilized FLC, but only if they were exposed to 2-5A. These data are compatible with the conclusion that (i) the activation of the 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease is not impaired in the variant cells, and (ii) the uninducibility of 2-5A synthetase can be bypassed by exogenously introducing its products, which leads to the establishment of a bona fide antiviral state.","['Federico, M', 'Romeo, G', 'Affabris, E', 'Coccia, E M', 'Rossi, G B']","['Federico M', 'Romeo G', 'Affabris E', 'Coccia EM', 'Rossi GB']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis"", 'Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oligoribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1986 Jun;6(3):233-40. doi: 10.1089/jir.1986.6.233.,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', ""61172-40-5 (2',5'-oligoadenylate)"", ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",,['10.1089/jir.1986.6.233 [doi]'],,,,

Study of HLA-class II transcripts in leukemias.,2050-6,"In addition to their role in the immune response, MHC class II antigens may be considered as differentiation markers on hemopoietic cells. To study expression of class II genes at the mRNA level in leukemias representing various stages of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, we constructed chain- and locus-specific HLA class II DNA probes. As the genes encoding the DR, DQ, and DP beta-chains display a strong sequence homology in the second extracellular and transmembrane domains, we used probes derived from the less conserved 3' untranslated regions. For the more divergent alpha-chain genes, DNA fragments derived from the coding portion were obtained from cDNA clones. All probes were designed to minimize background due to AT- or GC-rich segments and subcloned into pUC plasmids. Their lack of cross-hybridization was demonstrated in Southern blot experiments under moderately stringent conditions. Northern blot analysis of RNA from 15 patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias, chronic lymphoid and hairy cell leukemias showed that most patients expressed variable amounts of class II transcripts, some lacked all class II mRNA, and only two patients had a dissociated expression of class II genes, with lack of DQ and presence of DR and DP mRNA. This study reveals a vast heterogeneity of MHC class II gene expression in leukemias, as previously demonstrated at the protein level. The availability of these highly specific DNA probes should prove useful in extensive studies directed at better defining HLA class II gene expression during hemopoietic differentiation in physiologic and pathologic states.","['Piatier-Tonneau, D', 'Turmel, P', 'Auffray, C', 'Charron, D']","['Piatier-Tonneau D', 'Turmel P', 'Auffray C', 'Charron D']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1986/09/15 00:00,1986/09/15 00:01,['1986/09/15 00:00'],"['1986/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Sep 15;137(6):2050-6.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,

In this study we describe the effects of hexose 6-O-sulfate esters on NCMC against K-562 target cells. Mannose 6-sulfate, galactose 6-sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate, and N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate inhibit NCMC in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10 mM and below. Inhibitory effects of mannose 6-sulfate and galactose 6-sulfate were evident at concentrations as low as 1.25 mM. The neutral forms of these sugars, glucose and glucose 6-sulfate, did not inhibit NCMC over this range of concentrations. Comparison of the inhibitory effects of sulfated and phosphorylated forms of mannose and galactose indicated that the sulfated forms are much more potent inhibitors. Formation of effector cell:target cell conjugates was unaffected by the presence of sugar sulfates. Calcium pulse experiments demonstrated that inhibitory effects of sugar sulfates were exerted after the Ca++-dependent triggering step in the NK lytic process. Kinetic studies showed that addition of sugars as long as 60 min after initiation of cultures yielded potent inhibitory effects. Sugar sulfates were not toxic for effector cell populations and effectors were not refractory for lytic function after removal of sugars. Sugar sulfates were inhibitory against multiple tumor types in both human and murine NK lytic assays. These results suggest that the sugar sulfates inhibit NK cells at a postconjugation, posttriggering step involving lectin-like receptors or lectin-like molecules.","['Chambers, W H', 'Oeltmann, T N']","['Chambers WH', 'Oeltmann TN']",['eng'],['CA 33005/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Acetylglucosamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Glucosamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hexoses/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Sulfuric Acids/pharmacology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Sep 1;137(5):1469-74.,"['0 (Hexoses)', '0 (Sulfuric Acids)', '10356-99-7 (N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)']",,,,,,

Staining was performed on frozen sections and/or cell smears by the recently developed APAAP immuno-alkaline phosphatase procedure. In about 90% of cases, neoplastic cells reacted strongly with antibodies against HLA-DR, leucocyte common antigen, B-cells (antibodies B1 and To15), hairy-associated antigens (antibodies KB-90, S-HCL3, HC2) and activated T-lymphocytes (antibodies anti-Tac and Tu69). The phenotype of 10% of cases was clearly different in that the neoplastic cells were negative or only weakly positive for one or more of the antigens recognized by HC2, anti-Tac and Tu69. Antibody HC1 reacted with tumour cells of only 50% of the hairy cell leukaemia cases investigated. Monoclonal antibody Ki-67 (which selectively detects proliferating cells) stained only a low percentage of cells in all but three of the cases studied. The neoplastic cells in all cases were unreactive with monoclonal antibodies anti-Leu1, Tu1, Tu33 and a meshwork of follicular dendritic cells was consistently absent from tissues infiltrated by hairy cells. The immunological phenotype associated with hairy cell leukaemia was not observed in any case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, suggesting that it represents a unique type of B-cell neoplasm.","['Falini, B', 'Pulford, K', 'Erber, W N', 'Posnett, D N', 'Pallesen, G', 'Schwarting, R', 'Annino, L', 'Cafolla, A', 'Canino, S', 'Mori, A']","['Falini B', 'Pulford K', 'Erber WN', 'Posnett DN', 'Pallesen G', 'Schwarting R', 'Annino L', 'Cafolla A', 'Canino S', 'Mori A', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 1986 Jul;10(7):671-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1986.tb02521.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1986.tb02521.x [doi]'],,,,

Effect of differentiation.,220-8,"The uptake of a fluorescent derivative of a fatty acid (FDFA), 12-(1-pyrene) dodecanoic acid (P12) by murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells was studied. Because of the intense fluorescence of the pyrene ring, the association of P12 with intact cells could be analysed using a fluorescence microscope or a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), and the incorporation of P12 into cellular lipids could be quantified, following their extraction in a spectrofluorimeter. These procedures indicated that P12 uptake and intracellular utilization are reduced, following induction of erythrodifferentiation by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA). The differences in the fluorescence observed following exposure to P12 permitted us to separate a mixture of differentiated and undifferentiated cells into two distinct cell subpopulations; the high fluorescence population consisted mainly of undifferentiated cells, and the low one of differentiated cells. The results of this study suggest that fluorescent fatty acids are useful for distinguishing between and sorting cells at different stages of differentiation.","['Fibach, E', 'Nahas, N', 'Giloh, H', 'Gatt, S']","['Fibach E', 'Nahas N', 'Giloh H', 'Gatt S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Kinetics', 'Lauric Acids/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mice']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1986 Sep;166(1):220-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(86)90521-5.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Lauric Acids)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,"['0014-4827(86)90521-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(86)90521-5 [doi]']",,,,

Only OCI cells were induced to differentiate to mature granulocytes by TPA. Both cell lines expressed, however, the monocytic associated cell surface antigen detected by MO1 monoclonal antibody in response to TPA. MO1 expression was detected as early as 32 hours after initiation of differentiation by TPA, whereas partial morphologic changes were apparent only after 72 hours. Induction of differentiation by retinoic acid led to a significant inhibition of colony formation in HSC variant (from 1522 +/- 60 to 523 +/- 20/10(4) cells plated) and in the OCI variant (from 628 +/- 20 to 185 +/- 33 colonies/10(4) cells plated). The addition of PHA-LCM further inhibited colony growth of both RA-induced cell lines (155 +/- 7/10(4) cells plated in HSC, and 59 +/- 4 in OCI). PHA-LCM by itself reduced HL-60 colony numbers in a dose-related manner, and also increased the expression of MO1 on noninduced HSC and OCI cells. These observations suggest that differentiation of HL-60 cells is not necessarily accompanied by concomitant change in morphology, cell surface characteristics, and proliferation potentials, and may be dependent on different degrees of cellular commitment. They also suggest a role for growth factors in the induction to maturation of leukemic cells.","['Kaplinsky, C', 'Estrov, Z', 'Freedman, M H', 'Cohen, A']","['Kaplinsky C', 'Estrov Z', 'Freedman MH', 'Cohen A']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', '*Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells. 1986;11(3):459-68.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,

The application of these methods, however, is often restricted by a low yield of mitotic cells and the patient's unwillingness to comply with repeated bone marrow aspiration. In an attempt to promote mitotic activity of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and peripheral blood, we employed a new method based on culturing the cells in the presence of a conditioned medium derived from a human bladder carcinoma cell line (5637). In addition to colony stimulating factor, this conditioned medium contains a factor that is capable of stimulating leukemic myeloblast proliferation. Bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 58 patients with a variety of myeloid leukemias were cultured for 24 to 120 hours in the presence or absence of conditioned medium. These bone marrow cells showed a pronounced increase in the mitotic index (5- to 50-fold) as compared to unstimulated cultures, and a greater than 100-fold increase as compared to fresh, uncultured bone marrow cells. Analyzable metaphases could be obtained even in marrow samples in which direct or 24-hour G-banding techniques had failed to reveal metaphases. The effect observed on peripheral blood cells was even more dramatic because prior to culture no mitotic cells were detected, whereas up to 2% mitotic cells were found in conditioned medium-stimulated peripheral leukemic cells. Karyotype analysis of 36 out of the 58 leukemic patients has shown that the chromosome changes discovered in conditioned medium stimulated cells were identical to those found in unstimulated cells. New chromosome aberrations, attributable to the stimulation of growth by conditioned medium, were not found. The quality of the metaphases analyzed following conditioned medium stimulation was considerably better than that of unstimulated samples. Frozen cells, when cultured with conditioned medium, were also suitable for cytogenetic analysis. Thus, the use of this conditioned medium permits adequate cytogenetic analysis even in cases where such analysis was previously impossible.","['Michaeli, J', 'Lerer, I', 'Rachmilewitz, E A', 'Fibach, E']","['Michaeli J', 'Lerer I', 'Rachmilewitz EA', 'Fibach E']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Growth Substances', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mitotic Index', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Sep;68(3):790-3.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",,['S0006-4971(20)69029-2 [pii]'],,,,

Growth rates and yields were essentially the same in the presence or absence of the selective dose of MTX for all variants. MTX resistance was not the result of a transport defect. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from our variants and DS-19 was inhibited to the same extent by MTX. Variants had increased dihydrofolate reductase activities. The specific activity of DHFR was proportional to the selective concentration of MTX employed to isolate a given variant. DNA dot blotting established that the cloned variant (MR400-3) had a 160-fold increase in DHFR gene copy number relative to the parental strain (DS-19). Hybridization studies performed in situ established the presence of amplified DHFR genes on the chromosomes of the MTX-resistant but not the MTX-sensitive (parental) cells. Quantitation of DHFR mRNA by cytoplasmic dot blotting established that the amplified DHFR gene expression was proportional to gene copy number.

The results show that membranes isolated from cells treated with these agents are defective in the phosphorylation of P150, a membrane phosphoprotein associated with drug resistance in HL60 cells. This response is highly selective since only a few membrane proteins show decreased phosphorylation levels under these conditions. Magnesium dependent protein kinase activity in membranes from cells treated with DMSO, RA or TPA is not altered relative to untreated membranes under conditions where there is a major decrease in P150 phosphorylation. Additional studies also show that treatment of resistant cells with TPA results in a major decrease in the in vivo phosphorylation of P150.

A total of 41 patients were entered into this study between January 1983 and July 1985, and 34 were considered evaluable. Two patients were added for evaluation of toxicity. There were 25 males and 9 females with a median age of 43 years. Of the 34 evaluable patients, 24 had previously been treated with intensive combination chemotherapy, 21 with anthracyclines. The remaining ten were previously untreated patients. Underlying diseases were acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in 15, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in 17 and blastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML/BC) in 2. EPI was administered intravenously in two schedules, a high-dose regimen consisting of 24 to 60 mg/m2/day for 3 to 5 days and a low-dose regimen involving 11-17 mg/m2/day for 5 to 8 days. Responses were obtained in 5 (33.3%) of 15 patients with ALL, 3 of these attaining complete remission, 2 (11.8%) of 17 patients with ANLL and one (50.0%) of 2 patients with CML/BC. Out of the 21 patients who had received previous anthracyclines, 4 (19.1%) attained responses. Also, responses were obtained in 23.5% with the higher doses as well as 24% with the lower doses. The remission duration of responders was 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 16+, 17 and 26 weeks, respectively. The major non-hematologic toxicity was stomatitis which occurred in 15 patients, in 11 of whom the symptoms were severe (Grade 3 or 4). This stomatitis was thought to be the dose limiting factor. On the basis of the above observations, we concluded that EPI was active against acute leukemia, especially ALL. Stomatitis was considered to be the dose-limiting factor, especially in the high-dose regimen. Toxicity was tolerable in the low-dose regimen.","['Sampi, K', 'Masaoka, T', 'Shibata, H', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Shirai, T', 'Umeda, M', 'Kozuru, M', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Oguro, M']","['Sampi K', 'Masaoka T', 'Shibata H', 'Shirakawa S', 'Kobayashi T', 'Shirai T', 'Umeda M', 'Kozuru M', 'Sugiyama H', 'Oguro M', 'et al.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Like other membrane-interacting agents (polar solvents), all the polymers tested were effective in inducing cell differentiation. This effect was found to be molecular weight dependent, as already reported for other membrane-related actions of these polymers. Since anthracyclines also exert direct effects on the cell membrane, the activity of the daunorubicin-PLL conjugate was also examined. The covalent linking of the drug to the polyamino acid somewhat reduced the differentiation-inducing activity in this system. Indeed, free daunorubicin was found to inhibit the maturational process. Although the inducing effect was observed when the free PLL or daunorubicin-linked PLL was added alone, polymers enhanced differentiation produced by suboptimal concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Since PLL was inactive as an initiator of the maturation of a DMSO-resistant line, it is likely that some events (presumably membrane-related effects) involved in the multistep stimulation process are common to polar-planar solvents and the polycationic polymer.","['Supino, R', 'Gibelli, N', 'Zunino, F']","['Supino R', 'Gibelli N', 'Zunino F']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polylysine/*pharmacology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Aug;77(2):453-7.,"['25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,

The urinary excretion of uric acid rose moderately from 447 +/- 251 micrograms/dl glomerular filtrate before chemotherapy to 778 +/- 463 micrograms/dl glomerular filtrate during tumor lysis (P less than 0.05) whereas the urinary excretion of hypoxanthine (17.9 +/- 15 to 292 +/- 213 micrograms/dl glomerular filtrate) and xanthine (74 +/- 62 to 1091 +/- 1085 micrograms/dl glomerular filtrate) rose dramatically (P less than 0.001). The urinary excretion of uric acid, hypoxanthine, and xanthine per deciliter of filtrate was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in those who developed acute renal failure than in those who did not, but the highest urine concentration of these purine metabolites did not differ in the two groups. In all 19 children, the highest urine concentration of uric acid and hypoxanthine during tumor lysis did not exceed the solubility limit of each in an alkaline urine specimen. In contrast, the peak urine concentration of xanthine exceeded its solubility limit in an alkaline urine specimen in 16 of 19 children. The urine sediment during the period of tumor lysis was examined by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy; precipitated xanthine was found in sediment from eight of the 19 children, was significantly (P less than 0.001) associated with a urine xanthine level greater than 350 mg/dL, and occurred with equal frequency in those who did or did not develop acute renal failure. We conclude that urinary excretion of hypoxanthine and xanthine increases dramatically whereas uric acid excretion rises moderately in children undergoing tumor lysis while receiving allopurinol, that acute renal failure occurs in children with a higher purine load per deciliter of glomerular filtrate, but that factors other than tubular precipitation of purine metabolites are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal failure during tumor lysis.","['Andreoli, S P', 'Clark, J H', 'McGuire, W A', 'Bergstein, J M']","['Andreoli SP', 'Clark JH', 'McGuire WA', 'Bergstein JM']",['eng'],['5 S07 RR5371/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/etiology/*urine', 'Allopurinol/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/*urine', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/urine', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Uric Acid/*urine', 'Xanthine', 'Xanthines/*urine']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1986 Aug;109(2):292-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(86)80387-0.,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Xanthines)', '1AVZ07U9S7 (Xanthine)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)']",,"['S0022-3476(86)80387-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(86)80387-0 [doi]']",,,,

Treatment consisted of ara-C, 3 g/m2 every 12 hours by three-hour infusion for eight doses followed by a second course of four doses on day 21. Remitters received consolidation with monthly courses of HDara-C for four doses. Additional systemic multi-drug reinduction therapy and direct CNS treatment with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) and cranial irradiation (CRT) was administered to the three remitters last treated. Thirteen of 20 patients (65%) achieved complete remission (CR): seven of seven patients with isolated meningeal leukemia and six of 13 patients with concurrent CNS and bone marrow disease. Of the remaining seven patients, five had a complete CSF clearing with persistent marrow disease. In all cases there was prompt resolution of neurologic signs and symptoms. The median duration of CR was 5 months (range 2 to 8 months). The most significant toxicity seen was myelosuppression, which was predictable and manageable. Nonhematologic toxicity was generally acceptable and included moderate nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, drug fever, transient liver dysfunction, and dermatitis. No cases of CNS toxicity occurred. There were no treatment-related deaths. Disease-free survival was limited by marrow relapse, either isolated or with concurrent CNS disease. No instances of isolated meningeal relapse occurred. These results obtained in a poor-risk subset of patients indicate that HDara-C is an effective treatment for the induction of remission in ALL and NHL with meningeal leukemia. Therefore, HDara-C should be considered for inclusion in multiagent consolidation programs for patients at high risk for CNS disease.","['Morra, E', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Inverardi, D', 'Brusamolino, E', 'Orlandi, E', 'Canevari, A', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Morra E', 'Lazzarino M', 'Inverardi D', 'Brusamolino E', 'Orlandi E', 'Canevari A', 'Pagnucco G', 'Bernasconi C']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Aug;4(8):1207-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.8.1207.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.8.1207 [doi]'],,,,

Only cells from myeloid leukemic lines that contained relatively mature cells (HL-60, U937, THP, HEL, M1) were induced to differentiate and were inhibited in their clonal growth by exposure to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 (50% inhibition, 3 X 10(-8)-8 X 10(-10) M). A fluorinated analog of vitamin D was 5-10-fold more potent than 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. Cells from a human myeloblast line (KG-1) and normal human granulocyte-monocyte stem cells (GM-CFC), both of which depend on colony-stimulating factor (CSF) for clonal growth, were stimulated in their clonal proliferation by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of CSF. Leukemic cells from 10 of 14 patients with myeloid leukemia, but not normal GM-CFC from 12 patients in remission, were markedly inhibited in their clonal proliferation by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3.

More than 80% of PL-21 cells cultured for 4 days with 10 ng/ml of TPA became macrophage-like cells with functional and histochemical properties consistent with monocytes/macrophages. The cells adhered to the plastic flask, developed phagocytic activity and macrophage-specific intracytoplasmic alpha subunit of S-100 protein, and had reduced myeloid-specific cytochemical markers. In contrast, RA-treated PL-21 cells displayed mature neutrophil-like morphology after 7 days of exposure. Most of the cells had reduced nitro blue tetrazolium and acquired phagocytic activity with persistence of myeloid-specific cytochemical markers such as peroxidase, naphthol-AS-D chloroacetate esterase, and Sudan black B.

Following 24 h of exposure to these agents, there is no effect on growth, but influx Vmax is reduced by 70%. After 7 days of exposure, influx Vmax is reduced 90-95%. A similar time course was seen for the reduction in intracellular levels of dihydrofolate reductase, a marker of cellular proliferation. Both the extent of terminal maturation (as determined by the extent of nitro blue tetrazolium reduction) and decrease in influx showed the same dependence on the concentration of inducer. In contrast to the effect seen on influx Vmax, both influx Km and mediated efflux of [3H]methotrexate remained unchanged in HL-60 cells exposed to inducers of maturation. Finally, evidence is presented for the coupling of this alteration on [3H]methotrexate influx with commitment of HL-60 cells to terminal maturation. This evidence shows that the effect on folate analogue influx precedes commitment and documents the irreversible nature of the reduction in influx once the majority of the cells exposed to inducer were committed to the process of maturation. The possible relevance of these results to the process of neoplastic transformation is discussed.","['Sirotnak, F M', 'Jacobsen, D M', 'Yang, C H']","['Sirotnak FM', 'Jacobsen DM', 'Yang CH']",['eng'],"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mathematics', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1986/08/25 00:00,1986/08/25 00:01,['1986/08/25 00:00'],"['1986/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Aug 25;261(24):11150-5.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['S0021-9258(18)67361-2 [pii]'],,,,

In order extend our understanding of the events associated with interferon-induced myeloid cytoreductions, we have examined the changes in granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) in such CML Ph' patients. A total of 28 CML Ph' patients in hematologic remissions following IFN-alpha treatment had a median GM-CFC of 12 (range, 0-182)/1 X 10(5) bone marrow cells. This was significantly lower than the median GM-CFC of 104 (range, 44-815; p less than 0.01) in 22 untreated or minimally treated CML Ph' patients and the median of 72 (range, 30-204; p less than 0.05) in 18 normal controls. A gradual decline in the GM-CFC numbers from a median of 105 to a median of 1.8 was seen in six responding patients who were studied serially over a median period of 7.5 months. In these patients, we also observed a profound decline in the number of aspirated bone marrow nucleated cells and a decline in the bone marrow cellularity. The effect of treatment interruption for a median of 13 days was studied in five patients. In three of the patients who had received IFN-alpha for less than or equal to 6 months, treatment interruption resulted in rapid increase in the GM-CFC, while the GM-CFC did not change in the remaining two patients, who received IFN-alpha for one and two years. We conclude that treatment of CML patients with IFN-alpha resulted in a progressive decline of the bone marrow GM-CFC. The initially expanded pool of committed myeloid stem cells declines gradually, and at the time of hematologic remission the number of GM-CFC/10(5) nucleated bone marrow cells is lower than that of normal controls. In the early phases of IFN-alpha treatment, this inhibitory effect is rapidly reversible, but it seems to persist when the treatment is extended over more than one year.","['Talpaz, M', 'Spitzer, G', 'Hittelman, W', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Gutterman, J']","['Talpaz M', 'Spitzer G', 'Hittelman W', 'Kantarjian H', 'Gutterman J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Monocytes/*cytology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Aug;14(7):668-71.,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],,,,,,

By comparison to that of adriamycin (ADM) and epi-adriamycin (Epi-ADM), the uptake of demethoxy-daunorubicin (DM-DNR) and THP-adriamycin (THP-ADM) is a rapid process. In cells exposed to DM-DNR or THP-ADM, a 50% accumulation is reached in less than 2 min, whereas 80 min and up to 4 hours are needed for epi-ADM or ADM, respectively. More than 95% of these anthracyclines are accumulated and retained in the nuclear fraction. Following a short cell exposure, the intracellular concentrations of the rapidly incorporated drugs (DM-DNR or THP-ADM) decrease with the cell density. After cell exposure to one of these drugs followed by growth in drug-free medium, the cytotoxic activity is related to the ease with which the anthracycline accumulates in cells. Since the pharmacological properties of these anthracyclines differ, and because cytotoxic activity correlates with these properties, plasma and intracellular concentrations of ADM and THP-ADM were studied after intravenous administration in leukaemic and non-leukaemic patients with various white blood cell concentrations. Since the pharmacokinetic studies in vivo correlated to in vitro parameters, it is concluded that administration modalities have to be determined, adapted to each patient, and considered differently according to the anthracycline used.","['Tapiero, H', 'Munck, J N', 'Fourcade, A']","['Tapiero H', 'Munck JN', 'Fourcade A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthacenes/metabolism/therapeutic use']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1986;12(1-3):257-64.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)']",,,,,,

It has also been found that normal mature granulocytes produce a chalone-like ""hemoregulatory peptide (HP)"" which seems to be involved in the inhibitory proliferation control of myelopoietic cells. In view of the intended use of maturation induction treatment as an alternative to current antileukemic therapy it appeared to be of interest to know if granulocytes, obtained by RA treatment of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, would produce normal HP or if their transformed phenotype would cause production of deviant regulatory peptide(s). It was found that conditioned media from RA-treated HL-60 cells inhibited myeloid proliferation but strongly stimulated the growth of erythroid and lymphoid cells. A low molecular weight thiol-containing peptide was isolated which inhibited colony formation by normal granulocyte-macrophage committed stem cells but unlike HP had no effect on (untreated) HL-60 cells themselves. It was also shown that the HL-60 RA peptide is chemically different from HP in terms of molecular size, electrophoretic mobility, composition, and NH2-terminal sequence, which was determined as glutamine-aspartic acid-proline. It is concluded that differentiated HL-60 cells produce hemoregulatory factor(s) with properties different from those of normal HP.

The degree of resistance of P388R cells to Adriamycin (ADR) and daunomycin was 50-fold and 38-fold, respectively, when compared to the parent cell line (P388S). The Adriamycin-resistant cells were highly cross-resistant to some anthrapyrazoles, but the degree of cross-resistance was not uniform and was less than 3-fold for one member of the series. The lipophilicity of these compounds appeared to correlate to some extent with the level of resistance. The calcium channel blockers verapamil (VER) and diltiazem and the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine potentiated the cytotoxicity of the anthrapyrazoles and ADR in P388R. This potentiating effect was concentration dependent with VER being the most efficacious. VER increased ADR cytotoxicity by greater than 10-fold and CI-937 by almost 40-fold. However, VER, diltiazem, and trifluoperazine had no effect on ADR or anthrapyrazole activity in P388S cells. The antiarrhythmic drug, quinidine, and the detergent, Tween 80, also potentiated ADR activity in P388R cells to the same extent as VER. Both the net accumulation and efflux of [3H]daunomycin were altered in P388R cells by nontoxic concentrations of Tween 80 in a fashion virtually identical to that demonstrated for VER. These data suggest that agents which potentiate drug cytotoxicity in P388R cells may do so by their interaction with the lipid domain of the plasma membrane. In addition, these results demonstrate that some members of the new series of DNA binding drugs, the anthrapyrazoles, may be active against anthracycline-resistant tumors and that, where cross-resistance to them occurs, it can be partially reversed by agents such as VER.","['Klohs, W D', 'Steinkampf, R W', 'Havlick, M J', 'Jackson, R C']","['Klohs WD', 'Steinkampf RW', 'Havlick MJ', 'Jackson RC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance/*drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Polysorbates/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Sep;46(9):4352-6.,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,

An increase in levels of c-myc RNA occurred early in this process when the cells are known to be in a precommitment early regulatory state. The increased levels of c-myc RNA occurred before any G1-0-specific growth arrest or phenotypic differentiation. Cells in G1 and S had similar levels of c-myc RNA during this process. Onset of growth arrest and phenotypic differentiation preceded an apparent decline of c-myc RNA levels. Levels of c-myc RNA decreased only in advanced cultures with growth arrest and differentiation essentially completed. The kinetics and cell cycle dependence of the early increase in c-myc levels paralleled previously reported nuclear structural changes characteristic of the precommitment state. Since c-myc encodes a putative nuclear matrix protein, the results suggest a regulatory role for increased c-myc expression in mediating the nuclear structural change characteristic of precommitment early in the retinoic acid-induced process of HL-60 terminal myeloid differentiation. The results argue against a change in c-myc RNA levels as a requirement for G1 to S transit or for G1-0-specific growth arrest during terminal differentiation. In contrast, the results argue for a putative regulatory role for c-myc in induction of the precommitment early regulatory state. C-myc may thus act in a homeotic regulatory capacity during HL-60 terminal myeloid differentiation.","['Yen, A', 'Guernsey, D L']","['Yen A', 'Guernsey DL']",['eng'],"['CA 33505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36483/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):4156-61.,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,

We examined the possibility that reversal of leukemia is related to a macrophage regulatory function in erythropoiesis. We found that the ability of macrophages to induce leukemia regression correlates with nonimmunological, in vivo suppression of normal and susceptible leukemic erythroid progenitors. The macrophage effect on erythropoiesis appears to be due to changes in a humoral regulator, related to but independent of erythropoietin. The results suggest a novel regulatory system for erythropoiesis, operative in vivo, and involving macrophages as accessory or suppressor cells.

A second ara-C injection, given when the largest fraction of cells is in S phase, causes the largest reduction in leukemic clonogenic cells. The relevance of recruitment and synchronization of leukemic cells after high dose ara-C (200 mg/kg) by rapid i.v. injection (comparable with 1 g/m2 in patients) has been tested in rats with respect to survival time and toxicity. Several groups of leukemic rats have been treated with seven injections of ara-C; the intervals between the injections per group were 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 h, respectively. The longest mean survival time is observed in the group treated every 9 h which is 70.8 days compared to 22.6 days in nontreated leukemic controls. This 9-h interval of ara-C administration corresponds with the moment when DNA synthesis of the leukemic cells resumes after its inhibition by the ara-C. The most severe toxic side effects on the gastrointestinal system are observed in the group that received ara-C every 6 h; no toxic death has occurred in the animals treated with 15-h or longer intervals. The effect of the increasing interval between two ara-C injections on the normal hematopoietic stem cells has been measured with the colony forming unit spleen assay. This study showed that the reduction of normal stem cells due to ara-C is independent of the interval of administration. This differential effect of ara-C on leukemic and normal hematopoietic stem cell kinetics might in part explain the mechanisms of achieving a complete remission in acute leukemia.","['Colly, L P', 'Peters, W G', 'Willemze, R']","['Colly LP', 'Peters WG', 'Willemze R']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Injections', 'Intestines/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Time Factors']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):3825-7.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,

Cells are known to regulate their receptor populations in response to many external and internal stimuli, including differentiation. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, which can be induced by dimethyl sulfoxide to differentiate into mature granulocytes, was used as a model to examine whether PDE receptors are regulated as cells differentiate in vitro. PDE binding was measured using [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu). Specific binding of [3H]PDBu to the undifferentiated cells was rapid, reversible, and time and concentration related. One class of noncooperative binding sites was found with approximately 3.3 X 10(5) cells, having a Kd of 27.5 nM. [3H]PDBu could be displaced from the binding sites by a series of biologically active PDEs, but not by inactive ones. The characteristics of [3H]PDBu binding to the differentiated HL-60 cells were almost identical to those of the undifferentiated cells, except that there was an increase in the number of binding sites to 9.1 X 10(5) cells. Production of reactive oxygen metabolites by the cells, as monitored by chemiluminescence (CL) in response to PDEs, was examined before and after dimethyl sulfoxide differentiation, to determine if the change in receptor density was accompanied by a change in cell function. Only the differentiated HL-60 cells produced a quantifiable CL response when exposed to PDEs. The potency of the PDEs in causing CL generation was the same as that for displacing [3H]PDBu. The correlation between CL generation and affinity for the binding site suggests that the PDE binding sites mediate this effect of the PDEs and, therefore, are receptors. These studies indicate that HL-60 cells regulate their PDE receptors as they differentiate in vitro, with minimal extracellular influence. This may reflect a portion of an internal mechanism to enhance or change response to an endogenous ligand for the PDE receptor as cells mature.","['Lane, R W', 'Sturm, R J', 'Borzelleca, J F', 'Carchman, R A']","['Lane RW', 'Sturm RJ', 'Borzelleca JF', 'Carchman RA']",['eng'],"['1T32ES07087/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03572/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'K04AM00565/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Neutrophils/analysis', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Protein Kinase C', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Tritium']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Aug;46(8):3782-8.,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,

A twofold or greater elevation of serum glutamyl pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) was found in 80% of the patients during induction therapy, in 63% of the patients during maintenance therapy, and 31% of the patients who completed therapy. Circulating hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) was noted in 26% of patients with liver function test abnormalities during maintenance therapy, and 45% of patients with liver function test abnormalities after the completion of therapy. Hepatitis B virus infection was therefore, the most important single cause of abnormal liver function during remission in our patient population. Though others have asserted that hepatitis B virus infection is relatively benign in immunosuppressed individuals, in our population, this agent often caused severe pathological and clinical sequelae. This may be related to the high frequency (50%) of co-infection with the delta agent in our HBsAg-positive patients. Furthermore, hepatitis B virus surface antigenemia conferred an adverse prognostic influence for these children in terms of their leukemia-free survival.","['Ratner, L', 'Peylan-Ramu, N', 'Wesley, R', 'Poplack, D G']","['Ratner L', 'Peylan-Ramu N', 'Wesley R', 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alanine Transaminase/analysis', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/analysis', 'Child', 'Hepatitis B/*complications/microbiology', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Prognosis']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Sep 1;58(5):1096-100. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860901)58:5<1096::aid-cncr2820580519>3.0.co;2-b.,"['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19860901)58:5<1096::aid-cncr2820580519>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],,,,

One of the main accepted morphologic criteria in the differentiation between acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is the absence of granules in the blast cells of ALL. We evaluated a patient with ALL in whom granules were present in the cytoplasm of 35% of the blast cells, as seen in AML. Cytochemical evaluation was performed, including periodic acid-Schiff reaction, Sudan black B, alpha-naphthyl acetate, alpha-naphthyl butyrate, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate, and acid phosphatase stains. The results of these studies confirmed the morphologic impression and diagnosis of ALL. Ultrastructural evaluation revealed that the granules consisted of many tiny vesicles closely packed together in a proteinaceous matrix, resembling to some extent the inclusions described in lymphocytes in the Chediak-Higashi syndrome, but clearly different. The morphologic, cytochemical, and ultrastructural studies of this unique case are presented in detail. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such granules have been described in blast cells of ALL.","['Fradera, J', 'Velez-Garcia, E', 'White, J G']","['Fradera J', 'Velez-Garcia E', 'White JG']",['eng'],['CA 12223-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cytoplasm/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Granulation Tissue/ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Middle Aged']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Aug;68(2):406-11.,,,['S0006-4971(20)69051-6 [pii]'],,,,

Light-density marrow cells were incubated with either or both drugs for one hour and cultured over leukocyte feeder layers; clusters and colonies were scored on days 7, 10, and 14. Only the percentage of cell kill in the presence of 1.8 mumol/L DNR was significantly associated with responses to induction therapy: median of 45% (range, 0% to 98%) for patients achieving complete remission v 16% (range, 4% to 23%) for nonresponders (P = .007). The relationship between clonogenic cell kill less than or equal to 23% and clinical responses was striking. Of the 11 evaluable patients with in vitro findings in this category, ten either failed induction therapy or relapsed within 1 year after attaining remission. Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival times indicated longer durations of remission for patients whose blast cells showed increased sensitivity in vitro to Ara-C alone, DNR alone, or a combination of the two agents. Seven of 11 patients with cell kills of greater than or equal to 49% in the presence of 1.25 mumol/L Ara-C remain free of leukemia, compared with only one of 12 whose cells were less sensitive to the drug (P = .006).

Nineteen patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML were followed over a ten-month period and compared with 23 normals, six patients with leukemoid reactions, and eight patients with phagocytic cell defects. The percentage of PMN binding of 31D8 among normal subjects was variable about a normal distribution with an average of 95 +/- 2% of cells binding 31D8. In contrast, there were two groups of CML patients: in 14 patients 88 +/- 3% PMN bound 31D8 while in the remaining five patients only 6 +/- 6% PMN bound 31D8. PMN 31D8 binding was normal in the control patient groups. Control antibodies 7C3 (binds to PMN precursors) and OKM1 (binds to the CR3 (iC3b) receptor) bound normally to CML neutrophils. Functionally, CML cells had normal chemotaxis to several stimuli and normal superoxide generation to phorbol myristate acetate. However, superoxide production in response to fmet-leu-phe was significantly less in 31D8 negative CML PMN than both 31D8 positive CML PMN and normal PMN which contained 85% 31D8 positive and 15% 31D8 negative PMN.

In contrast, one of five patients with 31D8 negative PMN was in blast crisis at the time of study and all four of the remaining patients progressed to either the accelerated phase or blast crisis. Three of these patients died of their disease eight to ten months after their initial study. Thus, failure of CML cells to bind 31D8 may be useful for predicting which patients are likely to progress to the accelerated phase or blast crisis.","['Gallin, J I', 'Jacobson, R J', 'Seligmann, B E', 'Metcalf, J A', 'McKay, J H', 'Sacher, R A', 'Malech, H L']","['Gallin JI', 'Jacobson RJ', 'Seligmann BE', 'Metcalf JA', 'McKay JH', 'Sacher RA', 'Malech HL']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/physiopathology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Aug;68(2):343-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,['S0006-4971(20)69041-3 [pii]'],,,,

Intracellular levels of cathepsin B and immunohistochemical staining of the enzyme were related to time in culture with increasing concentrations of TPA from 1 nmol/1 to 8.0 nmol/1. Synthesis of cathepsin B was associated with TPA-induced phagocytic activity of cells in culture, expression of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and reduced cell division.

These findings suggest that leukaemic cell migration in AL differs from that in CML.","['Nagaoka, T', 'Kuto, F', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Fujino, Y', 'Hirasawa, Y', 'Tokuhiro, H']","['Nagaoka T', 'Kuto F', 'Watanabe Y', 'Fujino Y', 'Hirasawa Y', 'Tokuhiro H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Aug;63(4):737-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb07557.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb07557.x [doi]'],,,,

In M4 AML CNS relapse occurred in patients with a high initial leucocyte count whereas in M5 AML CNS involvement tended to occur at presentation in children with low initial counts. Two-thirds of patients treated achieved remission and most failures were due to inadequate chemotherapy, although haemorrhage, leucostasis or metabolic complications caused early death in patients with M4 and M5 AML. With a minimum follow up of 3 years only 12% of patients are alive; these figures have not improved in consecutive series despite increasing intensity of induction and more recent availability of bone marrow transplantation. No features predictive of long-term survival were identified, but patients with myeloid differentiation (M1, M2, M3) did better than those with a monocytic or erythroid component (M4, M5, M6).

It is tempting to speculate that these growth factors produced by tumor cells could act as very good tumor markers. We have found that the conditioned medium of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) stimulated [3H] glucose incorporation into lipids in rat adipocytes. When the conditioned medium was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column, this activity was eluted in the fraction corresponding to a molecular weight of 10-12 K daltons. The production of this factor was maximal in the early log phase of cell growth and declined with increasing cell density. Differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophages was also associated with a decrease in the production of this factor. This factor also stimulated [3H] thymidine uptake into DNA and cell proliferation in HL-60 cells themselves. These data suggest the possibility of autocrine growth of HL-60 as a result of this factor. We have subsequently tried to purify this factor. Two liters of serum-free conditioned HL-60 medium were used as a starting material. The material was purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Finally, 1.1 microgram of purified sample was obtained. The degree of purification was 115,613-fold. Growth factors can be very good tumor markers because this is the only tumor marker which has now been clarified to have an important role in tumor growth.","['Kasuga, M', 'Yamanouchi, T', 'Asano, T', 'Tsushima, T', 'Takaku, F']","['Kasuga M', 'Yamanouchi T', 'Asano T', 'Tsushima T', 'Takaku F']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

This is of particular importance in treated patients in whom the presence of low levels of circulating leukemic cells may have considerable clinical relevance. We used multiparameter correlated flow cytometric analysis to detect and characterize human leukemia/lymphoma cells in small samples of unfractionated peripheral blood. Leukocyte surface antigens were labeled with monoclonal antibodies and simultaneous forward and right-angle light scatter and fluorescence signals were measured from each cell. An interactive computer program was written that permitted the two light scatter measurements to be displayed on the screen on a cell-by-cell basis (dot-plot). Subpopulations of interest could then be selected on the dot-plot for analysis of their fluorescence distribution.

The authors evaluated the reactivity of two TdT MoAb, one directed against a native site and the other against a denatured site, in bone marrow samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Results were correlated with the immunophenotype and compared with those obtained with an anti-TdT polyclonal antibody (PoAb). The authors found that 39 of the 45 children (87%) with ALL were positive with the anti-TdT PoAb, while only 25 of 45 (56%) were positive using MoAb. In the 41 of 45 cases of ALL for which marker studies were available, there was no relationship between immunophenotype and reactivity with the PoAb or either MoAb. Five cases of AML were studied and two were positive using the PoAb, but none showed staining with the MoAb. The authors' findings demonstrate that, although MoAb may be used to detect TdT in acute leukemia, the two MoAb used do not correlate with immunophenotype and are less sensitive than the PoAb. However, the MoAb appears to demonstrate more specificity for ALL than the PoAb, since it was not reactive in PoAb+ AML.","['Lanham, G R', 'Bollum, F J', 'Stass, S A']","['Lanham GR', 'Bollum FJ', 'Stass SA']",['eng'],"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Protein Denaturation']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1986 Jul;86(1):88-91. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/86.1.88.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",,['10.1093/ajcp/86.1.88 [doi]'],,,,

CML cells have two novel products: an 8.5-kilobase RNA transcript containing both abl and bcr and a 210-kilodalton phosphoprotein (P210) recognized by v-abl-specific antisera. To test whether the P210 is the product of the novel 8.5-kilobase bcr/abl fusion transcript, antibodies were prepared against c-abl and bcr determinants. By using these reagents and v-abl-specific antisera, it was demonstrated that the P210 in CML cells is indeed the protein product of the 8.5-kilobase transcript. By analogy to the gag/abl fusion protein of Abelson murine leukemia virus, the replacement of amino terminal c-abl sequences by bcr sequences in P210 may create a transforming protein involved in CML.

Although it seems likely that this is related to the heightened proliferative activity characteristic of primitive CML progenitor cell types, the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this report we show that either normal or CML peripheral blood progenitors can be maintained on preestablished normal marrow adherent layers for periods of 1-2 months. Under these conditions numbers of both normal and neoplastic progenitors are usually higher in the adherent layer than in the nonadherent fraction. Moreover, the number of primitive progenitors of high proliferative potential present in the adherent layer is sufficient to allow their cycling status to be determined. Such measurements demonstrate that primitive normal progenitors of blood origin, when cultured in the presence of a preestablished adherent marrow feeder layer, go in and out of cycle after each medium change but in the absence of a feeder layer remain continuously in cycle. In contrast, primitive CML progenitors of either blood or marrow origin cycle continuously regardless of the presence or absence of an adherent feeder layer. We suggest that early expansion of the CML clone is related to an ability of the neoplastic stem cells to ignore or overcome a negative regulatory signal produced by nonneoplastic adherent marrow cells whose normal function is to maintain the stem cell reserve in a quiescent state.","['Eaves, A C', 'Cashman, J D', 'Gaboury, L A', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Eaves, C J']","['Eaves AC', 'Cashman JD', 'Gaboury LA', 'Kalousek DK', 'Eaves CJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jul;83(14):5306-10. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.14.5306.,,PMC323940,['10.1073/pnas.83.14.5306 [doi]'],,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1987 Feb;84(4):1117']

Infection of NIH Swiss mice with SFFV resulted in excessive proliferation of erythroid cells that could still differentiate, and spleen cells taken from these mice were able to incorporate high levels of tritiated thymidine ([3H]dThd) in the absence of Epo, even in the presence of antibodies to Epo. In contrast, the level of proliferation of spleen cells from SFFVA-infected mice, but not those from SFFVP-infected mice, could be greatly enhanced by the addition of Epo to the cultures. Infection of newborn mice with F-MuLV resulted in the generation of Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus, which caused excessive proliferation of erythroid cells that appeared to be blocked in differentiation, resulting in severe anemia. Spleen cells from these mice were unable to proliferate in the absence of Epo. However, when increasing doses of Epo were added to the cultures, the cells proliferated at levels equivalent to the levels seen with SFFV. These results indicate that a proliferation assay based on the incorporation of [3H]dThd into spleen cells in response to Epo can be used as a quantitative means of assessing and comparing the effects of erythroleukemia-inducing retroviruses on the proliferation of their target cells.","['Ruscetti, S K']",['Ruscetti SK'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/immunology/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses', 'Mitotic Index', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thymidine/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Jul;77(1):241-5.,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,

Median remission duration was 2.5 months (range, 0.5 to 6 months). Survival duration was 6 months for responding patients and 1.5 months for those with resistant disease. The response rate was similar for patients with myeloid and lymphoid blast crisis (31% v 50%, respectively). The response rate was significantly higher for patients whose benign phase was less than 1 year (75% v 21%, P = .05) and who had prolonged marrow aplasia after ara-C (86% v 27%, P = .05). Myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity, and cerebellar toxicity occurred in two patients. Intracellular ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) levels were similar in blood and bone marrow leukemic cells and were slightly greater in the cells of responding patients compared to those with resistant disease.

Derivation and characterization of two antibodies with specificity for human myeloid cells.,1083-90,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and spleen cells from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were fused with HAT-sensitive human B lymphoma cells (RH-L4) in attempts to generate human monoclonal antibodies (Mab) against antigens with high specificity for myeloid leukemia cells. Forty-seven of 246 hybridomas secreted Ig that bound to AML cell surface constituents, as determined by FACS analysis of viable cells that were FITC-stained with the human Mab as the first-step reagent and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human Ig as second-step. Two of the 47 human Mab (one from each patient and designated AML-19 and CML-20, respectively) bound to both autologous and allogeneic myeloid leukemia cells. No significant binding was observed to cell surface constituents on human bone marrow cells, granulocytes, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, thymocytes, monocytes, lymphoblastic leukemia cells, fibroblasts, malignant B and T lymphocytic cell lines, and murine bone marrow cells. Both human Mab were IgG and were cytotoxic to myeloid leukemia cells in the presence of complement. About 70% of peripheral blood cell samples from 46 AML patients contained AML-19- and CML-20-positive cells, but the reactivity pattern had no correlation to the morphologic FAB classification of the samples. The promyelocytic HL60 cell line and the K562 cell line reacted with the two antibodies. Dot blot analysis of binding of AML-19 and CML-20 to cellular extracts immobilized on nitrocellulose paper showed that both human Mab in this assay also reacted with normal bone marrow cells. This was supported by microscopic immunofluorescence because both human Mab stained intracytoplasmatic structures in normal bone marrow cells, but both intracytoplasmatic and cell surface components stained in myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, immunoblotting demonstrated that both human Mab in leukemia cells reacted with two cellular proteins with Mr approximately 14,500 and 18,000, and in normal bone marrow cells with a molecule with Mr approximately 20,000. Immunoprecipitation of cell membrane molecules with both the AML-19 and CML-20 antibody precipitated from leukemic cells only the molecule with Mr approximately 18,000 and no components from normal bone marrow cells. It is concluded that myeloid leukemogenesis may result in generation of cell surface expression of either new or abnormally processed molecules that are immunogenic in the autochthonous host. These molecules may also be useful as markers in diagnosis of myeloid leukemia.","['Andreasen, R B', 'Olsson, L']","['Andreasen RB', 'Olsson L']",['eng'],['CA-35227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/immunology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 1;137(3):1083-90.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,

Retinoids with a derivatized terminal carboxyl group were significantly less active than all-trans-retinoic acid, and those with the addition of two methyl groups to the cyclohexenyl ring of retinoic acid or substitution of its beta-cyclogeranylidene group with a 1,1,3,3-5-indanyl ring system were markedly more active than all-trans-retinoic acid. Five of the retinoids strongly inhibited clonal growth of the HL-60 and KG-1 human leukemic cell lines (50% inhibition in the range of 3 X 10(-10)-1 X 10(-8) M) and markedly stimulated normal human myeloid colony formation (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells [GM-CFC] 150% stimulation in the range of 3 X 10(-9)-3 X 10(-8) M). Further studies suggested that: Common structural requirements of the retinoids were important in the modulation of both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. The retinoids were able to inhibit leukemic proliferation without induction of differentiation of the neoplastic cells. Studies on normal human GM-CFC suggested that the retinoids did not act by themselves as a colony-stimulating factor (CSF), or by stimulating accessory cells to produce CSF, but either required earlier progenitor cells to become GM-CFC or enhanced the sensitivity of GM-CFC to the action of CSF.","['Tobler, A', 'Dawson, M I', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Tobler A', 'Dawson MI', 'Koeffler HP']",['eng'],"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', 'Retinoids/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 Jul;78(1):303-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI112565.,['0 (Retinoids)'],PMC329562,['10.1172/JCI112565 [doi]'],,,,

When cells were ruptured by nitrogen cavitation, nascent alpha and beta spectrin were found to be associated with a membranous cell fraction and were not detected in the soluble cytoplasmic cell fraction. Nascent membrane-bound spectrin appeared not to be protected by membranes, since it was susceptible to trypsin degradation in the absence of detergent. On fractionation of cells with 1% Triton X-100, more (1.75-fold) nascent spectrin was found in the Triton-soluble fraction than in the Triton-insoluble fraction (cytoskeleton). In the Triton-soluble fraction, there was 55% more nascent beta spectrin than alpha spectrin, while the cytoskeleton contained nearly equal amounts of alpha and beta spectrin. Cells were pulse-labeled with L-[35S]methionine for 2 min and chase incubated for varying periods of time from 15 to 90 min with nonradioactive L-methionine. Radioactive spectrin accumulated in the Triton-soluble fraction for the first 15 min of chase incubation and then dropped by 25% in the next hour. By contrast, the amount of radioactive spectrin in the Triton-insoluble fraction rose gradually for 1 h of the chase period. This indicates that, in Friend erythroleukemia cells, a pool of membrane-bound spectrin containing an excess of the beta polypeptide is used to form the cytoskeletal system which is composed of equal molar amounts of alpha and beta spectrin. The location of spectrin was determined by immunoelectron microscopy. Small amounts of spectrin were detected in cells not treated with dimethyl sulfoxide and in these cells it was located on the surface membrane and within the cytoplasm. On treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide, complex vacuolar structures containing viruses appeared in the cells. In cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide for 3 d 30% of the spectrin was near the outer membrane and 25% was associated with vacuolar structures, whereas in cells treated for 5 and 7 d the majority of spectrin (57-61%) was located in the vacuolar areas.","['Pfeffer, S R', 'Huima, T', 'Redman, C M']","['Pfeffer SR', 'Huima T', 'Redman CM']",['eng'],['GM-28559/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Morphogenesis', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Solubility', 'Spectrin/biosynthesis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1986 Jul;103(1):103-13. doi: 10.1083/jcb.103.1.103.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (fodrin)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",PMC2113792,['10.1083/jcb.103.1.103 [doi]'],,,,

However, all such studies have been of short duration, and although a single application of diacylglycerol induces these effects, tumour promotion usually requires long and repeated application of tumour-promoting agents. Here we investigated the effect of 1-oleoyl 2-acetyl glycerol (OAG) on differentiation of Friend erythroleukaemia cells (FELC), since TPA must be present continuously to inhibit differentiation in this system throughout the experiment. We also studied the effects of OAG in both TPA-sensitive and TPA-resistant clones, to investigate whether OAG and TPA have a similar mode of action. We found a dose-dependent inhibition of differentiation by OAG in the TPA-sensitive clone, but not in the TPA-resistant clone. Repeated treatment was necessary to achieve these results; almost complete inhibition could be obtained when OAG was applied 7 times/day for 3.5 days at 3 micrograms/ml per application, whereas a single application of OAG at a higher dose had no effect. Protein kinase C, which is believed to be the common target of OAG and TPA, was present in both TPA-sensitive and TPA-resistant FELC clones. These results suggest that OAG mimics the long-term effect of TPA and that the mechanism by which FELC clones resist TPA and OAG is not a lack or functional deficiency of protein kinase C.","['Giroldi, L', 'Hamel, E', 'Yamasaki, H']","['Giroldi L', 'Hamel E', 'Yamasaki H']",['eng'],['1RO1 CA40534-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1986 Jul;7(7):1183-6. doi: 10.1093/carcin/7.7.1183.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Phorbols)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['10.1093/carcin/7.7.1183 [doi]'],,,,

Alkaline elution studies showed that m-AMSA induced protein-associated DNA strand breaks (PADB) in both myeloblasts and lymphocytes. Depending upon the m-AMSA concentration, there was a 4- to 9-fold difference in the level of PADBs induced by a given drug concentration in the myeloblasts of eight patients studied.

Aclarubicin disappeared very rapidly from plasma and whole blood after administration at a dose of 20 mg per patient by iv bolus injection. The concentration of active metabolite M1, on the other hand, increased for up to 2 or 4 hrs after administration and exceeded that of aclarubicin, and then remained at much higher concentrations than aclarubicin for up to 24 hrs after administration. In addition, the levels of aclarubicin and its metabolites in whole blood were much higher than the corresponding plasma levels in four of the patients. The drug concentrations in blood cells of 11 patients determined 4 hrs after administration showed a significant positive correlation with leukocyte counts. Moreover, the concentration of aclarubicin and its metabolites was found to be much higher in the leukocyte fraction than in the erythrocyte fraction in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that aclarubicin and its metabolites in blood cells were mainly accumulated in leukocytes. In the study of intracellular drug distribution in L1210 cells, the largest amount of aclarubicin was incorporated into the nuclear fraction. This suggests a close relationship between the pronounced drug accumulation in leukocytes and the high affinity of aclarubicin for DNA.","['Ando, S', 'Nakamura, T', 'Kagawa, D', 'Ueda, T', 'Nishimura, T', 'Kubo, A', 'Tsutani, H', 'Sasada, M', 'Uchino, H']","['Ando S', 'Nakamura T', 'Kagawa D', 'Ueda T', 'Nishimura T', 'Kubo A', 'Tsutani H', 'Sasada M', 'Uchino H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Naphthacenes/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1986 Jul;70(7):835-41.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']",,,,,,

A report from the Childrens Cancer Study Group.,590-4,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma constitute 42% to 45% of the cancers in infants, children, and adolescents: In 1985, an estimated 2025 children were newly diagnosed with these two cancers and 900 (43%) of the pediatric cancer deaths in the United States have been projected to be due to these diseases. The single most important obstacle to preventing these deaths is relapse, and prevention of relapse or salvage of the patient who has had a relapse continues to be a major therapeutic challenge. The most important initial step in the treatment of the child whose disease has relapsed is to determine, to the extent possible, the prognosis. In a child with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a relapse confers an extremely poor prognosis, regardless of site of relapse, tumor histology, or other original prognostic factors, prior therapy, or time to relapse. In the child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relapse, the prognosis depends on multiple factors. The primary therapy is chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy with marrow grafting. Other options exist, including no therapy, or investigational therapy. The therapy selected should be predicated on the prognosis. In the child with an isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse off therapy, minimum therapy should be administered, particularly if the relapse occurred without prior cranial irradiation. In the child whose relapse is more than 6 months off therapy, conventional therapy should be considered. Also, a patient with an isolated CNS relapse on therapy after prior cranial irradiation should be given moderate therapy. Bone marrow transplantation or high-dose chemoradiotherapy with autologous marrow rescue should be reserved in children with a second or subsequent extramedullary relapse, and possibly for those with a first isolated overt testicular relapse on therapy.","['Bleyer, W A', 'Sather, H', 'Hammond, G D']","['Bleyer WA', 'Sather H', 'Hammond GD']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/mortality', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Testicular Neoplasms/mortality', 'Time Factors']",1986/07/15 00:00,1986/07/15 00:01,['1986/07/15 00:00'],"['1986/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Jul 15;58(2 Suppl):590-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860715)58:2+<590::aid-cncr2820581330>3.0.co;2-5.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19860715)58:2+<590::aid-cncr2820581330>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],,,,

A reappraisal.,473-80,"Rational treatment of pediatric malignancies requires a detailed knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of those antineoplastic agents used therapeutically. A number of different agents are administered by the oral route. Recently, the clinical pharmacology of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX), the two agents that are the mainstay of maintenance chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), were investigated. Studies of oral 6-MP indicate that, contrary to previous information, the bioavailability of this drug is relatively poor after oral administration, and that plasma 6-MP concentrations achieved after uniform oral dosing are highly variable. Similarly, study of the pharmacology of orally administered MTX indicates that there is little correlation between MTX dose and the peak serum level achieved. These findings suggest that some patients may not be exposed to adequate systemic concentrations of 6-MP and/or MTX after oral administration, and raise the possibility that the development of relapse in some patients with ALL may be the result of a pharmacologic failure of oral maintenance therapy. A comprehensive prospective study of the clinical pharmacology of MTX and 6-MP in patients with ALL undergoing maintenance chemotherapy is currently in progress.","['Poplack, D G', 'Balis, F M', 'Zimm, S']","['Poplack DG', 'Balis FM', 'Zimm S']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Allopurinol/pharmacology', 'Biological Availability/drug effects', 'Child', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Food', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Recurrence']",1986/07/15 00:00,1986/07/15 00:01,['1986/07/15 00:00'],"['1986/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Jul 15;58(2 Suppl):473-80. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860715)58:2+<473::aid-cncr2820581311>3.0.co;2-0.,"['63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19860715)58:2+<473::aid-cncr2820581311>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],,,,

Nineteen of the abnormalities were assigned to the 12p12 breakpoint. The median age of the children was 5 years (range 2 to 13 years) and their initial leukocyte counts ranged from 1,800 to 424,000/microL (median 30,000/microL). Twenty-one patients (91%) had common phenotype ALL (CALLA+, HLA-DR+), including three cases with a pre-B cell phenotype (CIg+). The remaining two cases were T cell in origin. The French-American-British (FAB) morphologic type of lymphoblastic leukemia was L1 in all cases but one. With a median follow-up of 11 months, four patients have relapsed and another failed induction therapy. The modal chromosome number in all cases was less than 50. Three distinct cytogenetic patterns, with apparently similar clinical manifestations, were noted: terminal deletions of chromosome 12 in 10 cases, apparently balanced reciprocal translocations in 6, and unbalanced translocations in 7. All translocations were between the 12p arm and different donor chromosomes except for chromosomes 7, 9, and 17, which participated twice.

We show a marked heterogeneity in the UEA-binding abilities of the cells in these patients as determined by fluorescence analysis of the blasts labeled with the UEA coupled to the fluorescent molecule FITC. The results suggest a correlation between the capability of AML blast cells to bind UEA and cytologic maturation, because in 1 of 10 M1, 3 of 8 M2, 6 of 8 M4, and 1 of 3 M5 cytology types UEA binding to the leukemic cells was apparent. In 13 cases, the cells gave rise to colonies in vitro. The amount of UEA binding to AML colony-forming cells (AML-CFU) was determined by cell sorting and subsequent colony culture of UEA-negative, intermediately positive, and highly fluorescent cells. AML-CFU from none of the four patients with M1 cytology were UEA positive, whereas they showed intense reactivity with the lectin in 1 of 4 cases with M2 cytology and in all 4 cases of M4. In these five cases with strongly UEA positive AML-CFU, the fluorescence distribution of the colony formers differed from that of the total leukemia population, indicating that AML-CFU represent a subpopulation of AML cells with specific UEA-binding properties. Normal bone marrow myeloid and multipotential colony-forming cells (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM) showed low or no binding of UEA. UEA-FITC appears a useful reagent for membrane analysis of AML-CFU. In certain cases, UEA-FITC labeling may be applied to discriminate AML-CFU from normal hematopoietic progenitors.","['Delwel, R', 'Touw, I', 'Bot, F', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Delwel R', 'Touw I', 'Bot F', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):41-5.,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (fucose-binding lectin)']",,['S0006-4971(20)69904-9 [pii]'],,,,

On the other hand, the major site of production of erythropoietin (Epo), which regulates physiologic red blood cell development, is thought to be the kidney. Here we report the isolation of multiple erythroleukemia cell lines that produce erythropoietic factors and present extensive biological, immunologic, and biochemical evidence to document that the active agent is Epo. The erythropoietic activity was neutralized by Epo antiserum and exhibited physical properties indistinguishable from those of human and sheep Epo. Positive lines produced between 0.1 and 1.5 U/mL of Epo, which stimulated erythropoiesis in vivo and in vitro in nine biological assays. Twenty sublines derived from single cells were inducible for hemoglobin and spectrin synthesis. All the sublines produced Epo. Production of the hormone continued when the cells were seeded in the absence of serum. Our finding that multiple independent isolates produce Epo raises the possibility that Epo production by erythroid precursors may play a role in normal erythropoiesis or, alternatively, that Epo gene activation may be a relatively common occurrence that contributes to, or is associated with, certain forms of virus-induced leukemias.","['Hankins, W D', 'Schooley, J', 'Eastment, C']","['Hankins WD', 'Schooley J', 'Eastment C']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):263-8.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,['S0006-4971(20)69884-6 [pii]'],,,,

To identify the changes most closely associated with prognosis, we analyzed the completely banded blast cell karyotypes of 161 children with this disease. One hundred twenty-five cases had one or more chromosomal abnormalities, with 45 showing translocations. The frequency of translocations was highest (58%) among patients with pseudodiploid karyotypes and lowest (0%) in the hyperdiploid group defined by 51 or more chromosomes. During the maximum 6-year follow-up period, 30 of the 45 patients with a translocation failed therapy, compared with only 27 of the 116 who lacked this feature. Life-table estimates of event-free survival indicate that only 14% of the translocation group will be in complete remission at 3 years. The percentages of failures associated with random and nonrandom translocations were virtually identical (68% v 65%). When entered in a Cox proportional hazards model with seven other types of chromosomal abnormalities, and then with 11 clinical and laboratory variables of known prognostic value in ALL, translocation emerged as the strongest single predictor of treatment outcome (P less than 0.0001). The model indicated that translocation increases the risk of treatment failure six times by comparison with the absence of this feature. These findings offer an explanation for the majority of early treatment failures in childhood ALL, including those previously attributed to ploidy classification.","['Williams, D L', 'Harber, J', 'Murphy, S B', 'Look, A T', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Rivera, G', 'Melvin, S L', 'Stass, S', 'Dahl, G V']","['Williams DL', 'Harber J', 'Murphy SB', 'Look AT', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Rivera G', 'Melvin SL', 'Stass S', 'Dahl GV']",['eng'],"['CA-2765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Jul;68(1):205-12.,,,['S0006-4971(20)69875-5 [pii]'],,,,

We have studied the effects of FUra on the synthesis of alpha- and beta-globin mRNA in murine erythroleukemia cells. An analysis of equivalent amounts of RNA from FUra-treated cells suggested that this agent causes a relative increase in globin mRNA. However, when RNA obtained from the same number of cells was analyzed, thus taking into account decreases in ribosomal RNA, the amount of intracellular alpha- or beta-globin mRNA actually decreased following FUra treatment. The decrease in globin mRNA was associated with decreases in both intracellular globin and hemoglobin content. The findings thus indicate that FUra inhibits the accumulation of alpha- and beta-globin transcripts. This effect of FUra could occur by decreasing transcriptional rate or, as in the case of ribosomal RNA, by interfering with the processing of these nucleic acids. Either mechanism could contribute to the RNA-related cytotoxicity induced by this agent.","['Iwata, T', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kufe, D W']","['Iwata T', 'Watanabe T', 'Kufe DW']",['eng'],['CA28488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Globins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1986/05/06 00:00,1986/05/06 00:01,['1986/05/06 00:00'],"['1986/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1986 May 6;25(9):2703-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00357a063.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1021/bi00357a063 [doi]'],,,,

Of 195 consecutive patients, 78 were black and 117 white. The annual incidence was 0.8/100,000 black children and 3.3/100,000 white. The low incidence in black children was due to the very low incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which was 0.41/100,000 black children compared with 2.73/100,000 white children. The incidence of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) was approximately the same for both ethnic groups; 0.38/100,000 black children and 0.57/100,000 white children. Remission rates for black children with ALL were lower than for white children and the cumulative proportion of black patients surviving at 60 months was only 32% compared with 72% of white patients (p = 0.0001). The most significant poor prognostic factors in ALL were ethnic group and age (p = 0.0006), CNS disease at onset (p = 0.006), FAB L2 and L3 morphology (p = 0.05), and irregular clinic attendance during maintenance therapy (p = 0.05). In ANLL, remission and survival rates were less favorable than in ALL but there were no significant differences between black and white patients. Black patients exhibited certain clinical features rarely seen in white patients, including chloromata, oropharyngeal lesions, and CNS involvement at onset. Karyotypic abnormalities were common.

Studies on pathogenesis using colony assays.,2-7,"Marrow hematopoiesis was examined in two infants with erythroleukemia (EL) using cell culture colony assays. At diagnosis, marrow from both yielded normal to increased numbers of granulocytic colonies (CFU-C), erythroid bursts (BFU-E), and mixed colonies (CFU-GEMM), which contrasted sharply with the reduced growth in eight other newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia. BFU-E proliferation and hemoglobinization proceeded normally in culture and was entirely erythropoietin-dependent. CFU-C colony cellular composition showed normal granulopoiesis in various stages of development. Despite low numbers of morphologically recognizable blasts in the aspirates, they were readily identified in a blast colony assay because of their high plating efficiency and high index of self-renewal on replating. Blast cells in all cultures had myeloblastic morphology, were peroxidase positive, and expressed the granulocytic-specific My-1 antigen. Monosomy 7 was seen in fresh and cultured blast cells but not in lymphocytes, indicating a clonal proliferation. After chemotherapy-induced remission, blast colonies and monosomy 7 could no longer be detected. It appears that the integrity and function of the normal hematopoietic progenitor pool were preserved in these patients with EL. The abnormal myeloblastic proliferation was expressed actively in colony assays and was useful diagnostically in these cases because marrow morphology was nondiagnostic. In these patients, EL seems to be a misnomer since the findings are suggestive of acute myeloblastic leukemia with secondary erythroid and granulocytic hyperplasia.","['Freedman, M H', 'Chan, H S', 'Chang, L']","['Freedman MH', 'Chan HS', 'Chang L']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Monosomy']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986 Spring;8(1):2-7.,,,,,,,

A fraction of fixed tumour cells in bone-marrow smears from patients with acute leukaemia have this handmirror shape. The incidence of handmirror cells has been reported to correlate positively with length of patient survival in some previous studies, but not in others. This controversy was elucidated by examination of bone-marrow smears of a retrospective material, consisting of smears from 32 patients with acute myelocytic leukaemia of the M1 and M2 type from 1971-1974. During this period, cytostatic treatment of acute myelocytic leukaemia was so weak that it can be considered almost negligible for the patient group studied. There was a positive but statistically non-significant correlation between incidence of handmirror cells and length of patient survival (Rs = +0.28, p = 0.11).

A series of leukemia cell lines was used to monitor biological activities of stromal cell lines representing five distinct subtypes. Only an endothelial-like clone derived from mouse stroma (MBA-2.1) was consistently found to produce a cell-surface-associated glycoprotein that selectively inhibited the growth of plasmacytomas. The factor, designated leukemia cell inhibitory activity (LCIA), was not detected in anchorage-dependent cells of nonhemopoietic origin. Tumors of the lymphoid lineage and plasmacytomas in particular were the most sensitive to LCIA. Myeloid, macrophage, and erythroleukemia tumors were resistant to the factor, as were normal hemopoietic target cells including pluripotent stem cells, myeloid progenitor cells, and mitogen-stimulated spleen cells. Fractionation of trypsin-released proteins from MBA-2.1 cells by gel filtration and affinity binding to concanavalin A-Sepharose revealed two types of inhibitors; one was the specific leukemia cell inhibitor (i.e., LCIA); the other, present at a lower titer, was non-target-cell specific. The high sensitivity of plasmacytomas to LCIA versus the resistance of normal stem cells may be utilized for selective elimination of plasma cell tumors from bone marrow inocula.","['Zipori, D', 'Tamir, M', 'Toledo, J', 'Oren, T']","['Zipori D', 'Tamir M', 'Toledo J', 'Oren T']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium/physiology', 'Glycoproteins/isolation & purification', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jun;83(12):4547-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.12.4547.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)']",PMC323771,['10.1073/pnas.83.12.4547 [doi]'],,,,

We have treated ten such patients, without histocompatible donors, with this regimen, which consisted of fortnightly doses of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2) and an escalating dose of intravenous methotrexate (90-470 mg/m2) followed 24 hours later by asparaginase (15,000 units). Remission of disease had been successfully achieved in all patients using conventional therapy prior to the start of maintenance treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of methotrexate were estimated serially in several patients but remained relatively low despite dose escalation. It appears that additional intrathecal chemotherapy is therefore necessary. Treatment was generally well tolerated but there is concern about the incidence of neurotoxicity in patients who had previously received cranial irradiation and intensive intrathecal therapy.

At a concentration where beta-all trans RA induces myeloid differentiation and G1/0 specific growth arrest, 11,13-dicis and 9,13-dicis isomers failed to induce significant phenotypic differentiation, assayed by the inducible superoxide production characteristic of mature myeloid cells, but could induce moderate G1/0 specific growth arrest. The 9-cis and 11-cis isomers induced both phenotypic differentiation and G1/0 specific growth arrest. The occurrence of G1/0 specific growth arrest without phenotypic differentiation indicates that the induced cellular programs leading to phenotypic differentiation and G1/0 specific growth arrest are not tightly coupled. Within the 48-h period usually required by beta-all trans RA to induce onset of phenotypic differentiation and G1/0 specific growth arrest, all isomers could complete early events in the cellular programs leading to G1/0 specific growth arrest and phenotypic differentiation, but the dicis isomers could not complete late events in the phenotypic differentiation program. The capability of dicis isomers to drive late events in the G1/0 specific growth arrest program was also compromised. Characteristic early and late changes in Ca2+ binding cytosolic proteins induced by RA and its isomers were consistent with their early and late capabilities. Failure of the dicis isomers to induce differentiation was thus due to a failure in late events associated with aberrations in cytosolic, Ca2+ binding proteins.

A significantly elevated PMR was also detected for colorectal cancer (PMR = 171) and, among those employed 20 years or more, for cancers of the liver (PMR = 216) and pancreas (PMR = 162). No excess risk of bladder or lung cancer or leukemia was seen. Proportionate mortality analyses rarely show excess risk of both cancer and heart disease in a working population. Surprisingly, a significantly elevated risk of arteriosclerotic heart disease (PMR = 113) was found in this group. These findings indicate that solvent exposure may be associated with excess mortality risk in commercial pressmen.","['Zoloth, S R', 'Michaels, D M', 'Villalbi, J R', 'Lacher, M']","['Zoloth SR', 'Michaels DM', 'Villalbi JR', 'Lacher M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/mortality', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Occupational Diseases/mortality', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/mortality', '*Printing', 'Risk', 'Solvents', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mortality']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Jun;76(6):1047-51.,['0 (Solvents)'],,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that spermidine is required for proliferation of murine Friend erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We have also shown that spermidine is required at a transcriptional level for induction of MEL globin synthesis. Since studies monitoring c-myc expression have suggested that this gene also plays a role in both growth and differentiation, we have monitored the effects of inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase) activity and polyamine synthesis on levels of c-myc transcripts. The results demonstrate that the level of c-myc RNA is independent of ODCase inhibition and depletion of intracellular spermidine. More importantly, arrest of MEL proliferation is not associated with detectable changes in c-myc expression, while under these conditions there is a decline in ODCase transcripts. During induction of MEL differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), c-myc and ODCase undergo similar changes in patterns of expression. However, although spermidine is required for appearance of the differentiated MEL phenotype, depletion of this polyamine by ODCase inhibition had no detectable effect on the biphasic changes in c-myc RNA observed during MEL differentiation. Thus, these biphasic changes in c-myc expression are not sufficient for induction of the mature phenotype. Finally, these results would indicate that the regulation of c-myc expression during both proliferation and differentiation is independent of ODCase activity and inhibition of proliferation by spermidine depletion.","['Watanabe, T', 'Sherman, M', 'Shafman, T', 'Iwata, T', 'Kufe, D']","['Watanabe T', 'Sherman M', 'Shafman T', 'Iwata T', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],['CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Phenotype', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Jun;127(3):480-4. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041270319.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041270319 [doi]'],,,,

The most generally accepted hypothesis proposes that this progression is due to the development of genetic instability in the leukemic cells. In particular, the two phases of the disease are believed to reflect different, discrete genetic events. Such events remain undefined as yet, and the causal significance of observed genetic aberrations is not clear. An alternative hypothesis is presented here. It is assumed that the feedback interactions adjust the relative probabilities of maturation and replication of the 'committed' as well as the pluripotent cells, and further that mitotic cells at all stages possess considerable phenotypic adaptability; in particular their self-renewal capacity can vary in response to changes in the cellular composition of the tissue even within a conventionally defined compartment. On this basis, it is shown that chronic leukemia can arise and evolve into the blastic crisis from a progressive decline in a single clonal characteristic--inducibility to maturation. It is shown, with the help of mathematical considerations, how an initial hereditable event in an early hemopoietic cell can cause a disturbance of the tissue which feeds back onto the individual members of the clone, resulting in a cascade of dynamic changes which can lead to blast cell dominance.","['Grossman, Z']",['Grossman Z'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1986 Apr;5(4):671-7.,,PMC1166843,,,,,

The first study revealed t(8;21) in 15 of 16 metaphases in randomly plucked colonies from a dish, in which 65% of the total colonies were those consisting of immature myeloid cells and 35% were eosinophilic colonies identified by positive staining with Luxol-Fast-Blue. The second study, in which eosinophilic colonies were selectively plucked for cytogenetic analysis, showed Cq- and Gq+ markers, which were considered to be t(8;21), in all metaphases (6/6).

Its incidence is increasing, particularly in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia undergoing high dose cytosine arabinoside chemotherapy. The onset is heralded by prodromal fever, watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal distension, and nausea during the phase of severe neutropenia. The symptoms may then localize to the right lower quadrant with an associated increase in systemic toxicity. The diagnosis can be confirmed in these and other less specific cases by serial reexamination and abdominal radiographs, ultrasonography, computerized tomograms, or radionucleotide scans. The mainstay of management is complete bowel rest with nasogastric suction and total parenteral nutrition. Broad-spectrum combination antibiotics are essential, as is the avoidance of laxatives or antidiarrheal agents. Granulocyte support may be helpful. Patients with a history of nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints or of true typhlitis, successfully managed nonoperatively, should have prophylactic bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition instituted at the beginning of further chemotherapy. Patients with ongoing severe systemic sepsis who do not respond to chemotherapy and those with overt perforation, obstruction, massive hemorrhage, or abscess formation require surgical intervention. All necrotic material must be resected, usually by a right hemicolectomy, ileostomy, and mucous fistula. Divided ileostomy for less severe cases may be useful. Failure to remove the necrotic focus in these severely immunocompromised patients is fatal. With adequate recognition of typhlitis and its precipitating factors, the incidence of complications can be reduced through prevention and timely surgical intervention. Although typhlitis developed in a quarter of our acute myeloblastic leukemia patients, use of this combined approach was successful in all cases.","['Moir, C R', 'Scudamore, C H', 'Benny, W B']","['Moir CR', 'Scudamore CH', 'Benny WB']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg,American journal of surgery,0370473,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/*surgery', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Colitis/chemically induced/*surgery', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*surgery', 'Risk']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg. 1986 May;151(5):563-6. doi: 10.1016/0002-9610(86)90547-7.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,"['0002-9610(86)90547-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9610(86)90547-7 [doi]']",,,,

M.D. Anderson Hospital experience.,789-97,"Sixty patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated between 1973 and 1984. The overall median survival was 16 months with a five-year survival rate of 31 percent. The complete remission rate was 53 percent and was similar whether they received amsacrine- or anthracycline-based regimens (60 percent versus 51 percent). The median remission duration was 29 months. At five years, 43 percent of patients with responses to treatment had continuous remission and 57 percent were alive. Salvage therapy produced remissions in 53 percent of patients during first relapse, with two long-term survivors after further consolidation with bone marrow transplantation. Early fatal hemorrhage associated with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy during induction therapy occurred in 16 patients (26 percent). Multivariate analysis of the pretreatment patient characteristics significantly associated with an increased risk of fatal hemorrhage identified four that have primary prognostic importance: thrombocytopenia, elevated absolute blast and promyelocyte counts, old age, and anemia. Patients having up to two unfavorable features had a low risk of fatal hemorrhage compared with those who had more than two (5 percent versus 58 percent; p less than 0.0001). Overall, patients who received heparin had a lower incidence of fatal hemorrhage than those who did not (19 percent versus 32 percent). Heparin therapy was not beneficial to those at low risk but was associated with a trend towards decreased hemorrhagic deaths among high-risk patients (45 percent versus 67 percent). Cytogenetic studies demonstrated the characteristic 15;17 translocation in 73 percent of patients with analyzable metaphases, whereas 12 percent had other karyotypic abnormalities. Remission induction was often associated with a gradual atypical morphologic evolution into remission without intermediate hypoplasia with the interim marrows showing a high proportion of blasts. It is concluded that acute promyelocytic leukemia is a unique disease with a high potential for cure. Knowledge of its prognosis using present frontline and salvage therapy, of the factors related to fatal hemorrhage, and of the unusual patient marrow profiles during remission induction may improve the therapeutic approach.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J', 'Walters, R S', 'Estey, E H', 'McCredie, K B', 'Smith, T L', 'Dalton, W T Jr', 'Cork, A', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Freireich, E J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Walters RS', 'Estey EH', 'McCredie KB', 'Smith TL', 'Dalton WT Jr', 'Cork A', 'Trujillo JM', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],['CA 28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Aminoacridines/administration & dosage', 'Amsacrine', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/therapy', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/mortality', '*Hospitals, Teaching', '*Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Texas', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1986/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1986 May;80(5):789-97. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(86)90617-0.,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'V25F9362OP (zorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,"['0002-9343(86)90617-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(86)90617-0 [doi]']",,,,

We report the clinicopathological, immunological, and cytochemical features of two patients who had widespread, prominent lymphadenopathy secondary to AML as well as concurrent marrow leukemia (M1 and M2). For one patient the lymphadenopathy was the predominant abnormality prompting him to seek medical attention, while the second patient had symptoms of infection following a 9-month history of myelodysplasia. The disease in both patients was aggressive; one patient survived only 1 week and the other survived only 5 weeks after diagnosis. In both cases the granulocytic sarcoma was confirmed by cytochemistry studies (naphthol ASD-chloroacetate esterase on tissue sections and myeloperoxidase on imprint smears), and electron microscopy, including morphology (both cases) or ultrastructural localization of myeloperoxidase (case 2). Non-specific esterase activity was not detected in either patient's blasts, although serum lysozyme was elevated in both cases. Immunological studies revealed reactivity of both patients' cells with panleukocyte, MY4, MY7, OKM-1, and Leu-M1 monoclonal antibodies and with alpha-1-antitrypsin and muramidase antibodies. The cells of one of these patients also reacted with anti-S-100 protein. Although the cytochemical studies indicated that both cases exhibited only myeloid differentiation, the immunological markers suggested that the tumor cells possessed some features of monocytes, perhaps explaining their propensity for widespread tumor formation. Morphological, immunological, cytochemical, and ultrastructural methods of diagnosing granulocytic sarcoma are presented.","['Davey, D D', 'Foucar, K', 'Burns, C P', 'Goeken, J A']","['Davey DD', 'Foucar K', 'Burns CP', 'Goeken JA']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1986 Jan;21(1):89-98. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830210111.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,['10.1002/ajh.2830210111 [doi]'],,,,

To obtain information on individual exposures, radiation dose histories and detailed work histories by job and shop were evaluated for each subject. No statistically significant associations were found either between ionizing radiation or presumed solvent exposure and myelogenous or lymphatic leukemia. However, when specific job categories and shops were examined without benefit of a priori hypotheses, two occupations, electrician and welder, were found to be associated with leukemia.

Data suggest that idarubicin is absorbed rapidly after oral ingestion, in spite of nausea and vomiting, which appeared 3-4 h later and were easily controlled by antiemetic therapy. The purpose of fractionating the drug dosage over three consecutive days is to prolong in the blood an elevated concentration of the main idarubicin metabolite (13-dihydro-derivative), which presents in experimental models an antileukemic potency similar to the parent compound. This study confirms that idarubicin is effective in acute leukemia also by oral route. This formulation could offer some advantages for subjects who cannot tolerate parenteral chemotherapy and it could be proposed in maintenance leukemia protocols.","['Lambertenghi-Deliliers, G', 'Pogliani, E', 'Annaloro, C', 'Pacciarini, M A', 'Polli, E E']","['Lambertenghi-Deliliers G', 'Pogliani E', 'Annaloro C', 'Pacciarini MA', 'Polli EE']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1986/04/30 00:00,1986/04/30 00:01,['1986/04/30 00:00'],"['1986/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tumori. 1986 Apr 30;72(2):157-61.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,

In erythroleukaemia cells, there is both a continuous proliferation and a synthesis of haem, and these cell lines are therefore especially interesting for studies on iron metabolism. Iron can be efficiently delivered intracellularly by certain chelators which bypass the transferrin-receptor-mediated pathway of iron uptake. We now show that the human erythroleukaemia cell line, HEL, displays a greatly enhanced cell proliferation when cultured in the presence of the lipophilic iron chelator, ferric pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone. The proliferation is not accompanied by an increase in haemoglobin synthesis. The response is apparently not typical for all erythroleukaemia cells, since a similar cell line, K 562, did not respond to the chelator by enhanced proliferation.","['Ekblom, P', 'Landschulz, W', 'Andersson, L C']","['Ekblom P', 'Landschulz W', 'Andersson LC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*physiology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Isoniazid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Pyridoxal/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/physiology']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1986 Mar;36(3):258-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1986.tb01731.x.,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Transferrin)', '3THM379K8A (Pyridoxal)', '737-86-0 (pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'V83O1VOZ8L (Isoniazid)']",,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1986.tb01731.x [doi]'],,,,

We analyzed the phenotypic marker profile of the CTV-1 cells in their original, untreated state and during induction of differentiation with the phorbolester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). TPA led to morphological changes with signs of differentiation. Cell proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent fashion during exposure to TPA. In the surface marker analysis using a panel of 45 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and several polyclonal antisera, CTV-1 cells were negative for markers of the T- and B-cell lineages, and were positive for several, but not all, myelomonocytic markers. Although the cells were reactive with the MoAb Leu-7 which identifies natural killer (NK) T-cells, no NK activity was detected. In the isoenzyme analysis of the four enzymes carboxylic esterase, acid phosphatase, hexosaminidase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) performed by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels, CTV-1 cells displayed isoenzyme profiles of immature myeloid cells. The overall marker profile of CTV-1 cells demonstrated cells of monocytoid origin arrested at a very early stage of differentiation, possibly close to the stage of precursor cells. As compared to other myelomonocytic cell lines, CTV-1 cells showed unusual morphological, immunological, functional and biochemical features and appeared to be relatively insensitive to treatment with TPA, although some alterations of the phenotype could be induced.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Maeda, S', 'Chen, P M', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G', 'Maeda S', 'Chen PM', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Hexosaminidases/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 1986;6(5):503-17.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,

In an attempt to elucidate the biochemical mechanism responsible for this phenomenon we have induced FELC with 5 mM hexamethylenebisacetamide and labeled the DNA in vivo with a density label, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and a radioactive label, deoxy[5-3H]cytidine. Newly replicated DNA (heavy-light) was separated from parental DNA (light-light) by isopycnic centrifugation. Incorporation of deoxy[5-3H]cytidine into light-light duplex DNA has been observed only in induced cells concomitantly with the demethylation of the DNA, whereas, in parallel experiments, deoxy[G-3H]adenosine was not incorporated into light-light DNA. It was also found that the labeling of light-light DNA with deoxy[5-3H]cytidine is transient since the 3H label was removed from the DNA during the period of de novo DNA methylation that follows the demethylation. These results, taken together, strongly suggest that the demethylation of the DNA during differentiation is achieved by an enzymatic mechanism whereby 5-methylcytosine is replaced by cytosine.","['Razin, A', 'Szyf, M', 'Kafri, T', 'Roll, M', 'Giloh, H', 'Scarpa, S', 'Carotti, D', 'Cantoni, G L']","['Razin A', 'Szyf M', 'Kafri T', 'Roll M', 'Giloh H', 'Scarpa S', 'Carotti D', 'Cantoni GL']",['eng'],['GM 20483/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Dealkylation', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 May;83(9):2827-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.9.2827.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",PMC323399,['10.1073/pnas.83.9.2827 [doi]'],,,,

Also, the putative viral polymerase has been found to share amino acid homology with reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Using computer-assisted DNA and protein sequence analyses, we examined the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine human, two duck, one woodchuck, and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology to corresponding regions of the genomes of type C retroviruses and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. Specifically, the most highly conserved sequence of the HBV genome, positioned at or near the initiation site for first-strand HBV DNA synthesis, is homologous over 67 nucleotides to the U5 region, a comparable region in retrovirus long terminal repeats. Within a highly conserved (i.e., 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence a heptanucleotide sequence CCTTGGG is 97% homologous between 27 virus isolates. Also, we found that the highly conserved HBV core, or nucleocapsid, protein shares 41% homology over 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, as with the previously reported polymerase homology, HBV is most homologous to the murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses have a common evolutionary origin, with HBV arising through a process of deletion from a retrovirus, or retrovirus-like, progenitor.","['Miller, R H', 'Robinson, W S']","['Miller RH', 'Robinson WS']",['eng'],"['1F 32 CA07221-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-13526/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U41-01685-02/PHS HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Biological Evolution', 'Capsid/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Apr;83(8):2531-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.8.2531.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)']",PMC323332,['10.1073/pnas.83.8.2531 [doi]'],,,,

The tumor rejection antigens (TRAs) that mediate this reaction are highly specific for each tumor; cross-protection between different syngeneic sarcomas is rare. Isolated membrane and cytosol fractions from two antigenically distinct BALB/c sarcomas, Meth A and CMS5, have TRA activity, and biochemical characterization of the active components from the cytosol and plasma membranes of these two tumors identified a glycoprotein of Mr 96,000. Immunization with unfractionated Meth A cytosol frequently leads to tumor enhancement, but the tumor-enhancing activity (TEA) is lost on fractionation and TRA activity becomes demonstrable. As Meth A and CMS5 lack expression of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) antigens or transcripts, MuLV-related antigens cannot be involved in the TEA or TRA activities of these tumors. In contrast to the lack of cross-reactivity between Meth A and CMS5 TRAs in transplantation tests, rabbit antiserum prepared against the Meth A Mr 96,000 antigen reacted with the CMS5 Mr 96,000 antigen. In view of the biochemical and antigenic similarities of Meth A and CMS5 TRAs, we propose that structurally related but distinct Mr 96,000 glycoproteins are expressed in chemically induced sarcomas and that these molecules are responsible for the individually specific immunogenicity of these tumors.","['Srivastava, P K', 'DeLeo, A B', 'Old, L J']","['Srivastava PK', 'DeLeo AB', 'Old LJ']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cytosol/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 May;83(10):3407-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.10.3407.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",PMC323523,['10.1073/pnas.83.10.3407 [doi]'],,,,

Incidence of both ALL and ANLL is higher in males than in females in childhood but not in adulthood. Incidence of ALL is higher than incidence of ANLL in childhood, while the reverse is true in adulthood. After a fall in incidence in young adulthood, both ALL and ANLL show age-incidence curves that are similar to those of most adult carcinomas: Incidence increases as a power of age.

Enzymologic characterization of a neutral serine esterase associated with myeloid cells.,727-33,"Monocytes contain a characteristic, prominent set of membrane-bound nonspecific esterases with a slightly acid isoelectric point. These esterases are also detected at modest levels in some granulocyte preparations. They are not apparent in lymphocytes. Among 18 fresh myeloid leukemias and myeloid leukemia cell lines, those of subtypes M4 (myelomonocytic) and M5 (monocytic) were strongly positive; some of subtypes M1-M3 (granulocytic) were moderately positive. The esterases were not detected among 32 fresh lymphoid leukemias and lymphoid leukemia and lymphoblast cell lines. The membrane-bound monocyte esterases, solubilized by treatment of monocyte preparations with nonionic detergent, were resolved by ion-exchange chromatography. The monocyte species account for 80-95% of the total nonspecific esterase activity of monocytes. The resolved enzymes behave as neutral serine carboxyl esterases and are highly sensitive to inhibition by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and also by sodium fluoride. Similar analysis of a lymphocyte preparation yielded no detectable monocyte esterases, but yielded numerous other forms which were generally resistant to inhibition by DFP and NaF. These nonspecific esterases are also present at background levels in monocytes. The resolution and characterization of the membrane-bound serine esterases from monocytes demonstrates the basis for the well-known cytochemistry of monocytes. The results are also crucial to the development of an immunologic surface marker test for myeloid cells and the study of monocyte membrane physiology.","['Yourno, J', 'Burkart, P', 'Mastropaolo, W', 'Lizzi, F', 'Tartaglia, A']","['Yourno J', 'Burkart P', 'Mastropaolo W', 'Lizzi F', 'Tartaglia A']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Esterases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Isoflurophate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Naphthols/metabolism', 'Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1986 Jun;34(6):727-33. doi: 10.1177/34.6.3457861.,"['0 (Naphthols)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)', '830-81-9 (alpha-naphthyl acetate)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', '9UZL9U0CIK (alpha-naphthyl butyrate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.- (serine esterase)']",,['10.1177/34.6.3457861 [doi]'],,,,

In order to investigate the mechanism of this effect, we incubated HL60 cells with [32P]orthophosphate with or without TPA and extracted their proteins with the cationic detergent benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride prior to electrophoresis in a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel system in the first dimension. In this system, proteins migrate toward the cathode as a function of their molecular weight, and they are separated from other radioactive components which can obscure the pattern of protein phosphorylation on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels. SDS gel electrophoresis was used in the second dimension, resulting in the clear resolution of a large number of proteins. TPA caused many changes in the pattern of protein phosphorylation in intact cells. Two proteins which prominently increased their incorporation of 32P were investigated in particular, and they were both found to be retained in the nuclear matrix following successive extraction of cells with Triton, digestion with DNase and RNase, and extraction with 2 M NaCl. These proteins migrated with apparent molecular weights of 80,000 and 33,000 on SDS gels, and are designated NP80 and NP33, respectively. NP80 was half-maximally phosphorylated after 7 min exposure to TPA, and half-maximally phosphorylated by 10 nM TPA. NP80 co-migrated with a faint Coomassie Blue-stained protein, and NP33 co-migrated with a more prominent protein. Several proteins incorporated less 32P when the cells were exposed to TPA, including one which was extracted from nuclei with the core histones and which co-migrated with histone H2A. Further study will be needed to determine whether the differentiation of HL60 induced by TPA is mediated via phosphorylation of these nuclear matrix proteins.","['Macfarlane, D E']",['Macfarlane DE'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear', '*Autoantibodies', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Nucleoproteins', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/05/25 00:00,1986/05/25 00:01,['1986/05/25 00:00'],"['1986/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 May 25;261(15):6947-53.,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['S0021-9258(19)62708-0 [pii]'],,,,

Analysis of the defect using the monoclonal antibodies HNK-1 (LEU-7) and B73.1.,639-49,"Quantitative evaluation of natural killer (NK) cells using the HNK-1 (Leu-7) and B73.1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was correlated with NK activity in 13 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and compared to normal donor controls. A consistent observation was the presence of normal absolute numbers of B73.1+ lymphocytes as well as normal to increased absolute numbers of HNK-1+ lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood of chronic-phase CML patients. Despite normal to increased numbers of B73.1+ and HNK-1+ lymphoid cells, these patients consistently demonstrated a significant impairment of lymphocyte-mediated NK activity in their peripheral blood. Further experiments demonstrated that chronic-phase CML patients, in contrast to normal controls, had significantly increased percentages of HNK-1+, E+ and B73.1+, E+ lymphoid cells and significantly decreased percentages of HNK-1+, E- and B73.1, E- lymphoid cells, which resulted in significant reversals of the HNK-1+, E+ to HNK-1+, E- and B73.1+, E+ to B73.1+, E- lymphoid cell ratios. (HNK-1+ [E+/E-] greater than B73.1+ [E+/E-]). Furthermore, as compared to normals, both FACS-sorted HNK-1+ and B73.1+ lymphoid cells from the E+ fraction of CML patients were consistently defective in NK activity, and could not be substantially augmented with alpha-interferon preparations. Although markedly defective in their ability to lyse K-562, HNK-1+ lymphoid cells from the E+ fraction of CML patients were not defective in their ability to bind to the NK-sensitive target, K-562. In contrast, NK-defective B73.1+ lymphoid cells were partially defective in their ability to bind to K-562.","['Fujimiya, Y', 'Bakke, A', 'Chang, W C', 'Linker-Israeli, M', 'Udis, B', 'Horwitz, D', 'Pattengale, P K']","['Fujimiya Y', 'Bakke A', 'Chang WC', 'Linker-Israeli M', 'Udis B', 'Horwitz D', 'Pattengale PK']",['eng'],"['AM-29846/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rosette Formation']",1986/05/15 00:00,1986/05/15 00:01,['1986/05/15 00:00'],"['1986/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 May 15;37(5):639-49. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910370502.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",,['10.1002/ijc.2910370502 [doi]'],,,,

At 0-4 degrees C the recovery of leukocytes after methylcellulose separation was low (64%). Cold hypotonic lysis gave better recovery (100%) when performed at the same temperature. After low-volume (2 ml extraction mixture) drug extraction from isolated leukocytes, the recoveries of DNR, DOL, and DOX from the cells were low, and they were inversely related to the cellularity of the sample, irrespective of the amount of drug in the cells. With high-volume extraction (5 ml extraction mixture) the recoveries were better (up to 95%), but they remained dependent on the cellularity. A correction factor accounting for these cellularity-related recoveries was applied to calculate the DNR and DOL contents of the leukocytes. Finally, using this information, plasma and cellular DNR and DOL levels were measured in seven patients with AML during their first course of remission induction therapy.

MRA is only two- to threefold more cytotoxic to P388/S in culture than ADR, whereas MRA-CN is 500-fold more cytotoxic than ADR to this cell line. Yet both MRA and MRA-CN retain their potency against P388/ADR in spite of a 150-fold decrease in potency for ADR. The observed noncross-resistance of both MRA and MRA-CN in P388/ADR correlates with their increased cellular uptake and retention relative to ADR and the inability of P388/ADR to exclude these analogs as readily as it does ADR. The decreased uptake of MRA and MRA-CN in P388/ADR relative to P388/S (1.5 to 2.0-fold), the increased efflux, and the ability of verapamil to enhance cellular uptake of these analogs in P388/ADR, as it does with ADR, all indicate that the mechanism of ADR-resistance effects ADR and the morpholino analogs in a similar manner but to far different extents. The potent cytotoxicity of MRA-CN appears to be related to strong cellular interactions of the drug with macromolecules that are characterized by its nonextraction from cells by chloroform: methanol or 10 M urea and may therefore represent covalent binding.","['Streeter, D G', 'Johl, J S', 'Gordon, G R', 'Peters, J H']","['Streeter DG', 'Johl JS', 'Gordon GR', 'Peters JH']",['eng'],['CA 32215/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1986;16(3):247-52. doi: 10.1007/BF00293986.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '80790-68-7 (NSC 354646)', ""88254-07-3 (3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)"", 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",,['10.1007/BF00293986 [doi]'],,,,

The incidence of positivity of 16 MoAbs (MCS-2, MCS-1, OKM1, My-1, Leu-M1, Leu-M3, CA-2-38, MY4, MY7, MY8, MY9, VIM-D2, VIM-D5, Mo1, Mo2, 63D3) was studied using the indirect immunofluorescence technique. A carboxylic esterase isoenzyme which can be inhibited completely and selectively by sodium fluoride (NaF) was demonstrated by isoelectric focusing on horizontal polyacrylamide gels. This NaF-sensitive isoenzyme indicated the monocytic origin of the blast cells as it is specific for this cell lineage. Prior to the immunological-isoenzymatic analysis all cases were categorized into two subtypes according to morphological criteria of the FAB classification system: 147 cases of AML (FAB M1-3) and 12 cases of AMMoL/AMoL (FAB M4/5). However, 15 out of 147 cases of AML expressed the NaF-sensitive isoenzyme and were therefore assigned to the group AMMoL/AMoL. Likewise, 1 case, diagnosed morphologically as AMMoL, was negative for this marker isoenzyme and was assigned to the other leukemia subtype. The incidence of reactivity varied widely for the MoAbs tested regarding the overall results on all cases and the positivity of cases of either AML or AM-MoL/AMoL. The MoAbs were grouped into four classes depending on the pattern of reactivity with myeloblastic or monoblastic or both subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. The MoAbs MCS-2, MY7, Leu-M1, and MY9 detected the vast majority of cases with either myelocytic or monocytic involvement (group-I: ""pan-myelomonocytic"" reactivity). The MoAbs MCS-1, OKM1, VIM-D5, and Mo1 showed a predominance in their staining pattern for monocytic variants, but were also positive on a substantial percentage of nonmonocytic cases (group-II: predominantly reactive with monocytic, but also myelocytic cases). The MoAbs Leu-M3, MY4, VIM-D2, Mo2, and MY8 reacted with the large majority of AMMoL/AMoL cases and with a small number of AML cases (group-III: monocyte-""specific"" reactivity). The MoAbs of group-I are useful in differentiating acute lymphoid from acute myeloid leukemias. The MoAbs of group-III, and to a lower extent those of group-II, will be of considerable value in the subtyping of acute myeloid leukemias. The results show that accuracy of leukemia classification might not always be achieved by morphology alone, but that immunological and biochemical aspects should be included as well, and several MoAbs are very useful tools for classification and subtyping of acute myeloid leukemias.","['Drexler, H G', 'Menon, M', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Menon M', 'Gaedicke G', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Esterases/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/enzymology/*immunology', 'Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1986;21(3):188-92. doi: 10.1007/BF00199360.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",,['10.1007/BF00199360 [doi]'],,,,

D-Glucose transport activity showed a half-saturation concentration of 2.2 mM and was inhibited by mercuric ions, cytochalasin B, phloretin, and stilbestrol, but was not strongly inhibited by phloridzin. Transport of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose was faster than D-glucose and the intracellular concentration of the sugar was found to reach the concentration in the assay medium. The treatment of cells with a differentiation-inducing reagent, dimethylsulfoxide(Me2SO), for 24 h caused a marked decrease in glucose transport activity due to a decrease in Vmax. In an induction-insensitive Friend cell line, T-3-K-1, D-glucose transport activity was low in untreated cells and Me2SO treatment did not cause a significant decrease in transport activity. The results obtained in this study indicate that the decrease in glucose transport activity is not due to the direct effect of Me2SO on transport activity, but is associated with the induction of differentiation.

We administered low-dose Ara-C (5-10 mg/m2/12 h s.c. or i.v.) for 13 to 35 days with a mean of 16.7 days. Complete remission and partial remission were obtained in 8 of 31 (25.8%) and in 9 of 31 (29.0%) respectively. A high response rate was found in M2 types showing a tendency for mature and refractory anemia with excess blasts in MDS according to the FAB classification. In our cases, severe pancytopenia in peripheral blood as a result of Ara-C was observed before normal hematopoiesis recurred. From the above results, the mechanism of low-dose Ara-C may induce remission by a cytotoxic rather than a differentiation effect.

All fourteen showed a blunted GH response to insulin hypoglycaemia and, in twelve, the GH response to arginine stimulation was also subnormal. Physiological GH secretion was studied by measuring integrated GH concentrations in 30 min blood samples collected over a 24 hour period by a continuous withdrawal pump. Compared to normal controls (n = 5), the irradiated patients showed a significant reduction in the mean integrated GH concentration (2.2: 8.8 mU/l; p less than 0.002), the total 24 hour GH output (mean 105.7 mU vs. 391.7 mU; p less than 0.002) and the mean GH output during the first six hours of sleep (mean 48.2 mU vs. 226 mU; p less than 0.002). There was no significant correlation between the maximum peak GH response to either pharmacological test and the total 24 hour GH output. Conventionally most short children undergo two provocative tests of GH release and if the GH response to one of the two tests is normal, it is usually assumed that GH production is adequate. Adopting these criteria in this study it would have been assumed incorrectly that GH production was normal in two children. Nonetheless all 14 children showed a blunted GH response to an ITT as well as a reduced total 24 hour GH output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ahmed, S R', 'Shalet, S M', 'Beardwell, C G']","['Ahmed SR', 'Shalet SM', 'Beardwell CG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arginine/pharmacology', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/blood/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/radiotherapy', 'Male']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1986 Mar;75(2):255-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1986.tb10195.x.,"['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",,['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1986.tb10195.x [doi]'],,,,

Multidrug resistance in human KB carcinoma cells selected in colchicine, vinblastine, or Adriamycin is associated with amplification of specific DNA sequences (the multidrug resistance locus, mdr1). During colchicine selection resistance is initially accompanied by elevated expression of a 4.5-kilobase mdr1 messenger RNA (mRNA) without amplification of the corresponding genomic sequences. During selection for increased levels of resistance, expression of this mRNA is increased simultaneously with amplification of mdr1 DNA. Increased expression and amplification of mdr1 sequences were also found in multidrug-resistant sublines of human leukemia and ovarian carcinoma cells. These results suggest that increased expression of mdr1 mRNA is a common mechanism for multidrug resistance in human cells. Activation of the mdr1 gene by mutations or epigenetic changes may precede its amplification during the development of resistance.","['Shen, D W', 'Fojo, A', 'Chin, J E', 'Roninson, I B', 'Richert, N', 'Pastan, I', 'Gottesman, M M']","['Shen DW', 'Fojo A', 'Chin JE', 'Roninson IB', 'Richert N', 'Pastan I', 'Gottesman MM']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1986/05/02 00:00,1986/05/02 00:01,['1986/05/02 00:00'],"['1986/05/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/02 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 1986 May 2;232(4750):643-5. doi: 10.1126/science.3457471.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",,['10.1126/science.3457471 [doi]'],,,,

The interferon was given as 5 X 10(6) units per square meter of body-surface area per day intramuscularly during induction therapy. Fourteen patients responded to the treatment, of whom 13 had a hematologic remission and 1 had a partial hematologic remission. The median number of white cells in those patients declined from 60.9 X 10(3) to 3.4 X 10(3) per microliter, and the median number of platelets decreased from 476 X 10(3) to 231 X 10(3) per microliter. Among the five responding patients who had splenomegaly before treatment, the spleen size returned to normal in four and decreased by 75 percent in one, although it remained enlarged. Bone marrow cellularity declined from a median of 92.5 percent to a median of 57.5 percent. In six of the patients with hematologic remission, complete suppression of Philadelphia cells was observed on at least one examination. Of the 14 patients who responded, 11 have received the interferon therapy for 9 to 15 months. One patient relapsed during the treatment, and the treatment has been temporarily interrupted in two patients because of toxicity. These data are preliminary and will need further confirmation, but they suggest that recombinant human interferon alpha A is effective in inducing hematologic remission in most patients with benign-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia and in suppressing the Philadelphia chromosome in some of these patients.","['Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'McCredie, K', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Keating, M J', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'McCredie K', 'Trujillo JM', 'Keating MJ', 'Gutterman JU']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/genetics/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Platelet Count', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/pathology']",1986/04/24 00:00,1986/04/24 00:01,['1986/04/24 00:00'],"['1986/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1986 Apr 24;314(17):1065-9. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198604243141701.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,['10.1056/NEJM198604243141701 [doi]'],,,,

Aplastic anemia differed from the classical form, since erythroid cells and megakaryocytes were relatively preserved in the bone marrow. Treatment with androgens induced the increase of hematocrit and reticulocyte as well as general improvement. The sudden appearance of hemorrhagic syndrome due to thrombocytopenia was associated with aggravation of anemia and granulocytopenia. In the bone marrow, giant multinuclear proerythroblasts with bizarre nuclear morphology and PAS positivity with coarse granules was found. Serum erythropoietin (Ep) level was high. Bone marrow cells culture in vitro revealed two types of erythroid colonies: typical and giant multinuclear cells, both benzidine-positive. The number of colonies was irrespective to the Ep dose.

When compared with tonsil-derived B lymphocytes and thymocytes, ALL lymphoid cells have an increased amount (absolute and relative) and a change composition of the UDP sugars. Significant differences were found between the mean values for the immunologically defined subgroups of ALL and between the mean values for patients with a high or a low percentage of blast cells.

In a number of human undifferentiated B-cell lymphoma (UBL) cell lines carrying the t(8:14) translocation it has been shown that the human c-myc gene is located on the region of chromosome 8 (8q24), which is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IHC) locus on chromosome 14 [7, 24].

Chemotherapy for CLL consisted of chlorambucil and steroids, later vincristine and bleomycin; after resistance to these agents, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone were applied. When CML was diagnosed, we found two morphologically distinct populations of malignant cells in the bone marrow; the Ph1-chromosome was identified, and immunological surface marker studies also demonstrated two distinct malignant cell populations. Up to now, only five cases of CML have been reported following CLL and one case accompanying it. Three patients were treated with cytostatic drugs, one patient by total body irradiation and two patients received no therapy. At present, it is not clear whether the development of CML during CLL represents a therapy-induced complication or an increased susceptibility to second malignancies due to the leukemic process itself or possibly to immunological deficiencies in CLL. Since two patients received no treatment for CLL, previous therapy does not seem to be a prerequisite for the development of CML.","['Teichmann, J V', 'Sieber, G', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Karow, J', 'Ruehl, H']","['Teichmann JV', 'Sieber G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Karow J', 'Ruehl H']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(4):361-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90064-0.,,,['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90064-0 [doi]'],,,,

This treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 also produced an inhibition of DNA synthesis that was promptly reversed when 1,25(OH)2D3 was removed. When such treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 immediately followed a sublethal exposure to drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis, including the cancer chemotherapeutic agents cytarabine and hydroxyurea, the proportion of HL-60 cells lethally damaged was increased. This finding was demonstrated by morphologic evidence of cell damage and disintegration, an increased permeability to trypan blue, loss of cells from culture, and a reduced clonogenic potential of the treated cells. Exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 before treatment with a cytotoxic agent had a slightly protective rather than a damaging effect. These observations suggest that the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 markedly reduces the capacity of HL-60 cells to repair DNA damage or to reduce the intracellular concentration of cytotoxic agents.","['Studzinski, G P', 'Bhandal, A K', 'Brelvi, Z S']","['Studzinski GP', 'Bhandal AK', 'Brelvi ZS']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1986 Apr;76(4):641-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/76.4.641.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['10.1093/jnci/76.4.641 [doi]'],,,,

Direct evidence of whether cells from each colony had leukemogenicity in recipient mice was successfully obtained by the colony transplantation assay. Both leukemic colony-forming unit-spleen (L-CFU-s) and leukemic colony-forming unit-culture (L-CFU-c) in L-8057 may have belonged to the same differentiating stage in the stem cells because of their similar radiosensitivity, although some parts of the L-CFU of L-8057 seemed to have lost their capability to regenerate L-CFU-s when the cells were plated in dishes. This leukemic stem cell preserves high self-renewal ability in vitro after 10 passages. In addition, in vitro colony formation by this leukemic cell during the above course of serial passages did not require any additional exogenous stimulators.

TPP+ accumulation within the cells (experimental accumulation ratio, AR exp) was measured by adding 2 microM TPP+ directly to the culture flasks, avoiding any other perturbation of the experimental system. The mitochondrial contribution to AR exp, evaluated by adding carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), was apparently negligible in standard cultures, AR exp being substantially the same in either the absence or presence of these uncouplers. However, the addition of oligomycin produced a strong AR exp enhancement, which was abolished by FCCP, suggesting that MEL cell mitochondria are in state 3. The aspecific TPP+ binding was estimated by a new mathematical approach worked out to fit AR exp values measured in the presence of valinomycin at various extracellular K+ concentrations and plotted against the ratio of intracellular to extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]i/[K+]e). This binding was found to be close to zero in MEL cells. By applying the Nernst equation directly to AR exp values, delta psi p of these cells was then measured; this potential varying from -65 mV to -16 mV (inside negative) is inversely related to the cell density on the culture surface on which the cells sediment (cells/cm2; CD). The dependence of delta psi p on CD is practically eliminated by valinomycin and appears to be related to a cell interaction with the culture surface of the flasks, suggesting that in the immediate environment of MEL cells one or more factors are produced that modulate the K+ plasma membrane permeability (PK).","['Arcangeli, A', 'Olivotto, M']","['Arcangeli A', 'Olivotto M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Culture Media', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/metabolism', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/metabolism', 'Potassium', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Apr;127(1):17-27. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041270104.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'U9IF5Y5IND (tetraphenylphosphonium)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041270104 [doi]'],,,,

Because the growth rate of mammalian cells is tightly coupled to the functions of the protein synthetic machinery, we have examined whether TPA induces a change in HL-60 translational functions. Addition of control HL-60 cell extracts to rabbit reticulocyte lysates results in a pronounced inhibition of protein synthesis, while TPA-treated HL-60 cell extracts are significantly less inhibitory. The reduction in TPA-induced translational inhibitory activity can be observed after a 3-6-h treatment and reaches a maximum after 24 h. Fractionation of control cell extracts on DEAE-cellulose columns reveals two inhibitory activities, eluting at 100 and 350 mM KCl, respectively. The DEAE-100 inhibitor(s) is further resolved into two activities by heparin-agarose column chromatography (HEP-100 and HEP-250). TPA treatment of HL-60 cells for 48 h completely eliminates the HEP-250 inhibitory activity and reduces the HEP-100 and the DEAE-350 inhibitory activities by 50 and 25%. Inhibition of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by DEAE-100 inhibitory activities can be partially reversed by the addition of globin mRNA while translational inhibition by DEAE-350 inhibitor(s) can be reversed by addition of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 or fructose 6-phosphate. The DEAE-100 inhibitor(s) causes extensive degradation of radioactive polynucleotides while the DEAE-350 inhibitor(s) is capable of phosphorylating both the alpha- and the beta-subunits of the highly purified rabbit reticulocyte initiation factor eIF-2. These data show that the DEAE-100 inhibitor(s) contains a nuclease while the DEAE-350 inhibitor(s) is associated with eIF-2 alpha and eIF-2 beta protein kinases.","['Konno, S', 'Borelli, T J', 'Wu, J M']","['Konno S', 'Borelli TJ', 'Wu JM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2', 'Fructosephosphates/pharmacology', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/04/15 00:00,1986/04/15 00:01,['1986/04/15 00:00'],"['1986/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Apr 15;261(11):5010-7.,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Fructosephosphates)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6814-87-5 (fructose-6-phosphate)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['S0021-9258(19)89207-4 [pii]'],,,,

Overnight exposure to iron donors such as diferric transferrin or hemin increases the ferritin level 2-4- or 6-8-fold above that of the control, respectively. Treatment with the anti-human transferrin receptor antibody, OKT9 (which reduces the iron uptake by decreasing the number of transferrin receptors) lowers the ferritin level by approximately 70-80% with respect to the control. The fraction of total cell-associated 59Fe (given as a pulse via transferrin) that becomes ferritin bound is proportional to the actual ferritin level and is independent of the instantaneous amount of iron taken up. This has allowed us to establish a curve that correlates different levels of intracellular ferritin with corresponding percentages of incoming iron delivered to ferritin.

Thirty patients with a suspected LPD were studied. By standard histologic, cytologic, immunologic (surface immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibody markers), and clinical criteria, the following diagnoses (independent of MR data) were made: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 12), CLL in transformation (n = 2), well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (WDLL) (n = 5), intermediate-differentiated lymphoma (IDL) (n = 2), hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (n = 3), prolymphocytic leukemic (PLL) (n = 1), poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (PDL) (n = 1), and no disease or reactive lymphocytosis (n = 4). There were 11 B-CLL cases and one T-CLL case. The percent of MR in all cases of B-CLL ranged from 26 to 76% (m = 62%); 10/11 cases had greater than or equal to 50% MR. The case with 26% MR was atypical in that it occurred in a 26-year-old patient. The percent of MR ranged from 0 to 42% (m = 16%) in the cases of well to intermediate differentiated lymphomas. Similar to previous reports intermediate proportions of MR were seen in HCL (12-41%); and low values were seen in PDL (4%) and PLL (4%). In summary, the MR assay may be a useful tool for differentiating CLL from other well to intermediate differentiated LPD involving the peripheral blood. Also, since the MR receptor is normally found only on functionally immature cells, this differential mouse rosetting capability suggests that CLL arises from a less mature cell than WDLL or IDL.","['Hicks, M J', 'Grogan, T M', 'Fielder, K', 'Spier, C M']","['Hicks MJ', 'Grogan TM', 'Fielder K', 'Spier CM']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diagn Immunol,Diagnostic immunology,8308082,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Mice', '*Rosette Formation']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diagn Immunol. 1986;4(1):31-6.,,,,,,,

Blast cell counts in the peripheral blood decreased in five patients with ANLL treated with the higher interferon doses; however, there was no evidence of an antileukemic effect in the marrow. Dose-limiting toxicity, which included malaise, hepatotoxicity, and coagulation abnormalities, was observed in patients given 20 or 30 million U/m2/day. Studies of the growth of leukemic progenitor cells in vitro in the presence of interferon disclosed a concentration-related inhibition of colony formation. Patients who had a decrease in peripheral blast cell counts demonstrated greater in vitro inhibition of clonogenic leukemic progenitors than patients whose blast cell counts did not decrease. However, the serum interferon concentrations in patients given clinically tolerable doses were lower than those concentrations which inhibited leukemic cell growth in vitro by a median of 42% (1000 U/ml).

This antigen is also found on several cell lines derived from myeloid malignancies of human origin. It is not present on mature hemopoietic cells or on the majority of differentiating bone marrow cells. In order to determine whether the NHL-30.5 antigen may, nevertheless, be expressed on low-frequency primitive normal hemopoietic cells, not detected in standard antibody screening procedures, its expression was studied on clonogenic erythropoietic and granulopoietic cells. Light-density (less than 1.077 g/mL) suspensions of normal or chronic myelogenous leukemia bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were stained with NHL-30.5 and fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled second antibody and then sorted into two fractions using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The first contained the top 5% of cells with the highest fluorescence intensity. The remainder were collected in the second fraction. Colony assays of both fractions showed the first to be enriched in CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-C content (fourfold to 17-fold). The second fraction was correspondingly depleted of these progenitors. These findings reveal NHL-30.5 antigen expression to be a transient event during normal hemopoiesis that characterizes primitive hemopoietic cells on several pathways. Subsequent experiments showed that the presence of up to 10 micrograms/mL of purified NHL-30.5 antibody in colony assay cultures neither inhibited nor stimulated colony formation. Marrow fibroblasts (subcultured marrow adherent cells) were NHL-30.5 negative. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the antigen detected by NHL-30.5 is clearly distinct from that identified by My-10, another monoclonal antibody that has previously shown some similarities to NHL-30.5. It thus appears that the NHL-30.5 antibody reacts with a new myeloid differentiation antigen of as yet unidentified function that is normally restricted in its expression to early stages of hemopoiesis.","['Askew, D S', 'Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J', 'Takei, F']","['Askew DS', 'Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ', 'Takei F']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology', 'Precipitin Tests']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Apr;67(4):1098-102.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,['S0006-4971(20)81288-9 [pii]'],,,,

Comparison of the yield obtained by chromatography with that by immunoprecipitation confirmed both the specificity and the quantitation of the antibody technique.","['Josic, D', 'Mattia, E', 'Ashwell, G', 'van Renswoude, J']","['Josic D', 'Mattia E', 'Ashwell G', 'van Renswoude J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytosol/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Ferritins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Iron/*analysis', 'Iron Radioisotopes/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/analysis', 'Methionine/metabolism']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1986 Jan;152(1):42-7. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(86)90116-8.,"['0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,"['0003-2697(86)90116-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(86)90116-8 [doi]']",,,,

The cellular morphology, surface marker antigen expression, and isoenzyme profiles of four enzymes (carboxylic esterase, acid phosphatase, hexosaminidase, and lactate dehydrogenase) served as parameters for monitoring the induced phenotypical changes. TPA led to distinct alterations of the morphology and significantly affected the growth rate with cessation of cell proliferation. No major increase in the number of nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells or aggregation of cells, phagocytosis of latex beads, adherence to plastic surface, or development of pseudopodia were observed. As TPA-treated SPI-802 cells remained negative for these markers of the monocyte-macrophage complex, it can be concluded that the cells did not differentiate into monocytes and macrophages. The immunological marker profile based on testing of 55 monoclonal antibodies, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and two erythrocyte rosette tests indicated a differentiation of SPI-802 cells along the granulocytic cell lineage. This was confirmed by isoenzyme analysis, especially that of carboxylic esterase. An isoenzyme specific for monocytes and macrophages was not detected. In earlier studies it was found that SPI-802 cells produce hemoglobin upon exposure to TPA or hemin. This latter observation and the present results suggested a comparison with the two erythroleukemia cell lines K-562 and HEL.

Examination of this subset of Tla genes (T3b, T3c, and T13c) by restriction enzyme analysis and oligonucleotide hybridization studies confirmed that T3b is the allele of T3c and that T3c and T13c may have arisen by duplication. The T3b gene, while not transcribed in the tissues of the TL- strain C57BL6, was shown to be transcriptionally active in the TL-expressing leukemic cell line ERLD derived from that strain. The T3b gene was cloned and its complete DNA sequence was determined. These data permit complete comparison of two Tla-region genes, T3b and its homologue T13c, and allow us to conclude that these genes show extraordinarily high sequence conservation, in contrast to alleles of the H-2K- and H-2D-region genes.

Our research indicates that bryostatin, a macrocyclic lactone that binds to the phorbol ester receptor in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, also binds to this receptor in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60. Bryostatin activates partially purified C kinase from HL-60 cells in vitro, and when applied to HL-60 cells in vivo, it decreases measurable cytoplasmic C kinase activity. Unlike the phorbol esters, bryostatin is unable to induce a macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells; however, bryostatin, in a dose-dependent fashion, blocks phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells and, if applied within 48 hr of phorbol esters, halts further differentiation. These results suggest that activation of the C kinase by some agents is not sufficient for induction of HL-60 cell differentiation and imply that some of the biologic effects of phorbol esters may occur through a more complex mechanism than previously thought.","['Kraft, A S', 'Smith, J B', 'Berkow, R L']","['Kraft AS', 'Smith JB', 'Berkow RL']",['eng'],['AI 22098/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Bryostatins', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Macrolides', 'Phorbol Esters/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(5):1334-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.5.1334.,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",PMC323070,['10.1073/pnas.83.5.1334 [doi]'],,,,

The first involves labeling studies with [3H]uridine and shows a greater initial labeling rate of globin RNA in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. Labeled globin RNA found in the cytoplasm after a very short pulse with tritiated uridine is of the ""mature"" 9S size while labeled globin RNA in the nuclei is exclusively in the form of 15S precursor molecules, suggesting that cytoplasmic globin RNA is not of nuclear origin. A high concentration of actinomycin D has no effect on the initial rate of labeling of cytoplasmic globin RNA, supporting this conclusion. Other experiments showed that the labeling of cytoplasmic globin RNA does not involve end addition to preexisting globin RNA. The second line of evidence is the identification of globin RNA minus strand in the cytoplasm of differentiated murine erythroleukemia cells by hybridization with single-stranded DNA probes containing the strand of the same sense as globin mRNA. This material has the same electrophoretic mobility as globin RNA and hybridizes with probes containing only the 5' part or only the 3' part of the gene suggesting that it is a full size copy of globin RNA. Finally, in murine erythroleukemia cells an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity is detected by using poly(A) . oligo(U) as a template-primer combination. This activity increases significantly after induction, suggesting that it is differentiation specific.","['Volloch, V']",['Volloch V'],['eng'],['5R01-CA33953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(5):1208-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.5.1208.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.48 (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",PMC323044,['10.1073/pnas.83.5.1208 [doi]'],,,,

Enhanced transcription of the cellular homolog (c-abl) of the transforming sequence of Abelson murine leukemia virus was observed in K3D, which was one of the cloned cell lines of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced rat erythroblastic leukemia. Since the c-abl activation was not observed in the parent cell line (K2D) from which K3D was derived and the latter was different from the former in the presence of a new marker chromosome, t(3;12), this marker may play a role in the expression of c-abl in K3D cells. In contrast to the human c-onc assignments, few rat c-onc assignments have been reported. In situ molecular hybridization studies assigned c-abl to the 3q12 site of the normal chromosome 3 and to the break point of the translocation t(3;12) in K3D cells. Another break point in this translocation chromosome 12p11 involves the nucleolar region, and the 3;12 translocation may involve c-abl and nucleolar cistrons.

Analysis of membrane markers.,155-65,"Membrane markers and functional properties in vitro of blast cells from the peripheral blood of 2 patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia were studied. Buffy-coat cells were enriched for colony-forming cells by density centrifugation (d less than or equal to 1.062 g cm-3). Upon culture, a large proportion of the (cryopreserved) low-density cells from both patients formed hemopoietic colonies that were heterogeneous with respect to size and cellular composition. Expression of membrane markers on the cells, which had the morphology of undifferentiated blasts, was studied using flow cytometry with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. A striking heterogeneity was observed in that variable numbers of cells were found to express myelomonocytic, megakaryocytic and erythroid membrane markers. Antigenic properties of colony-forming cells were studied by sorting of cells with a fluorescence activated cell sorter. Low numbers of cells (10, 4 and 1, respectively) were sorted directly into the wells of Terasaki microtest plates. With this system, it was shown that myeloid colony-forming cells from patient 1 were exclusively present in HLA-DR-positive cell fractions. Colony formation from the level of a single sorted cell was documented. Sorting of cells labeled with anti-blood-group-H antibody showed that small erythroid colony-forming cells from patient 2 were blood-group-H antigen-positive. These cells did not express HLA-DR. The other colony-forming cells from this patient and essentially all colony-forming cells from patient 1 were HLA-DR-positive and blood-group-H-negative. Although only 2 patients were tested, our studies clearly demonstrate that low-density cell fractions from the blood of patients with CGL provide distinct advantages for the study of membrane properties of hemopoietic cells and of hemopoietic differentiation in general.","['Lansdorp, P M', 'Bauman, J G', 'Bos, M J', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'Oosterhof, F', 'van Mourik, P', 'Tetteroo, P A', 'Zeijlemaker, W P']","['Lansdorp PM', 'Bauman JG', 'Bos MJ', 'von dem Borne AE', 'Oosterhof F', 'van Mourik P', 'Tetteroo PA', 'Zeijlemaker WP']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(2):155-65. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90038-x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90038-x [doi]'],,,,

Lysis of ALL blasts is induced with a cocktail of 3 monoclonal antibodies of IgM type (termed VIB-pool). These are directed against the CALLA (CD 10) antigen (VIL-AI antibody) and against 2 different epitopes of the CD24 surface structure (VIB-C5 and VIB-E3 antibodies). The purging efficiency was evaluated with leukemic cell lines of the common ALL type (Reh-6 and Nalm-6) and with blast cells from common ALL patients. Optimal lysis was obtained with antibody and human serum concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml and 7% respectively. As a standard purging protocol we propose one 20-min incubation at room temperature with antibody followed by two 30-min incubations at 37 degrees C with 25% human complement. In dye exclusion test 99% purging efficiency and in clonogenic assays detecting elimination of up to 5 logs of clonogenic tumor cells 99.99% (= 4 logs) purging efficiency were achieved.

Initiation of phagocytic capability following initiation of differentiation with 1.5% DMSO coincided with the attainment of respiratory burst activity as measured by NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium) reduction; the degree of phagocytic activity was dependent upon parameters such as microsphere size, microsphere number, and exposure time. Ingestion of fluorescent microspheres did not interfere with the measurement of DNA content using propidium iodide; thus, simultaneous determination of phagocytic activity and the cell cycle phase was possible. Accumulation of cells in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle following DMSO treatment was correlated with the acquisition of the capacity to phagocytize. Analysis of two-parameter correlated data also indicated that phagocytosis is coupled with residence in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle, further suggesting that the ability to phagocytize fluorescent microspheres is associated with end-stage differentiation.","['Blair, O C', 'Carbone, R', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Blair OC', 'Carbone R', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Microspheres', '*Phagocytosis/drug effects']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1986 Mar;7(2):171-7. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990070208.,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1002/cyto.990070208 [doi]'],,,,

Following pretreatment with the monoclonal antibodies anti-HNK-1 (anti-Leu-7) or anti-Leu-11b and complement, NK activity against K562 cells was assessed in 4-hr chromium release assays. Rheumatoid peripheral blood lymphocytes resembled those of normal individuals, in that complement-mediated lysis of Leu-11b+ cells virtually eliminated all NK activity. Complement-mediated lysis of Leu-7+ cells resulted in only a modest reduction in NK activity. Rheumatoid synovial fluid lymphocytes differed from autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes: the overall cytotoxicity was generally less and only a fraction of the NK-like activity appeared to be mediated by Leu-11b+ cells. This apparent lack of Leu-11b expression by rheumatoid synovial fluid NK-like cells could not be accounted for by blockage or alteration of the Leu-11b antigen by factors present in synovial fluid.

The cells were studied for morphology, for immunological markers using the fluorescence activated cell sorter, and for acid phosphatase isoenzymes using both cytochemistry and isoelectrofocusing. Morphologically the induced changes included appearance of cells with an excentric nucleus and basophilic cytoplasm and eventually of cells with many fine cytoplasmic projections (""hairs""). Analysis of immunological markers by flow cytometry revealed that the monoclonal antibody defined cell surface molecule HD6 (CD22), which is strongly expressed on hairy cell leukemia (HCL) but absent from plasmacytoma and plasma cells, can be induced or enhanced in the leukemic samples. In the study of acid phosphatase isoenzymes using cytochemistry we observed the induction of the tartrate resistant isoenzyme. Further, using isoelectrofocusing we could demonstrate the induction of the same band of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase with an isoelectric point of 9.0-9.7 as detected also in HCL. This particular isoenzyme is considered characteristic of HCL but is absent in plasmacytoma. Our data demonstrate that chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia cells can be induced to realize a common genetic program which bears characteristics of HCL, indicating that these three entities are much more closely related than previously thought.","['Ziegler-Heitbrock, H W', 'Munker, R', 'Dorken, B', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Thiel, E']","['Ziegler-Heitbrock HW', 'Munker R', 'Dorken B', 'Gaedicke G', 'Thiel E']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 2):2172-8.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,

Changes in the expression of DR antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of altered cell proliferation in chronic myeloid leukemia, since they result in decreased sensitivity of the colony forming units, granulocyte-macrophage to prostaglandin E and acidic isoferritins. In studies using monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic DR or DQ determinants, in a complement-dependent cytotoxic assay, it was found that nearly all normal and chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow colony forming units, granulocyte-macrophage express DR antigens. The dose response curve was similar for both normal and leukemic precursors. Leukemic peripheral blood precursors were more sensitive than were normal peripheral blood precursors. Normal colony forming units, granulocyte-macrophage did not express DQ antigens, whereas these were expressed in varying quantities by leukemic cells. This study shows that, in the patients we studied, leukemic cells express DR antigens in amounts comparable to normal. In addition, varying amounts of DQ antigens may be observed on leukemic but not on normal progenitors, perhaps as a consequence of an increase in the number of antigens also expressed by normal cells, though in an amount below the detection threshold of cytotoxicity techniques.","['Aglietta, M', 'Piacibello, W', 'Stacchini, A', 'Dezza, L', 'Sanavio, F', 'Malavasi, F', 'Infelise, V', 'Resegotti, L', 'Gavosto, F']","['Aglietta M', 'Piacibello W', 'Stacchini A', 'Dezza L', 'Sanavio F', 'Malavasi F', 'Infelise V', 'Resegotti L', 'Gavosto F']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'HLA-DQ Antigens', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/*immunology']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 1):1783-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,

Intracellular 19F spectral peaks are assigned by comparison with the pH-dependent chemical shifts measured for eight commercially available fluoropyrimidine metabolites as well as by comparison with the literature recorded values of five known catabolites of FUra. Five murine and human tumor cell lines (N1S1, Sarcoma 180, L1210, HL-60, and Mia-PaCa) were exposed in vitro for 24 h to cytostatic doses of FUra or 5-fluorouridine. Treated cells were harvested and analyzed immediately or following a subsequent incubation under either nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor conditions. A major narrow component peak at 4.6-4.9 ppm was observed in all cell samples analyzed immediately after treatment. This peak was identified as intracellular FUra nucleotides, and its T1 value was approximately 800 ms. No fluoropyrimidine catabolites were detectable in any of the treated cell lines. Free FUra could be measured in cells only after subsequent incubation under nutrient-poor conditions, and this was associated with a decline in the prominent FUra nucleotide peak. In treated cells chased with drug-free media containing 1 microM thymidine, spectra revealed a broad component signal underlying and downfield from the narrow nucleotide-containing peak. By biochemically fractionating treated cells into an acid-soluble fraction and phenol-purified cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA extracts, we were able to completely separate the nucleotide peak from the broad component signal resulting from FUra incorporation into RNA. Thymidine produced a marked enhancement of this 19F signal into both cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA without affecting the nucleotide signal from the acid-soluble fraction. The present ability of nuclear magnetic resonance to monitor the metabolic channeling of fluoropyrimidines in intact tumor cells suggests that future spectroscopic imaging of patients treated with fluorinated antimetabolites may provide clinically important information about tumor biochemistry and drug sensitivity.","['Keniry, M', 'Benz, C', 'Shafer, R H', 'James, T L']","['Keniry M', 'Benz C', 'Shafer RH', 'James TL']",['eng'],"['CA-27343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36769/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorouracil/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma 180/metabolism', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Apr;46(4 Pt 1):1754-8.,"['4K0M952561 (5-fluorouridine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,

Because cultured tumor cells became susceptible to natural killer (NK) activity, in vitro alteration of the blasts was studied. Immediately after thawing, cell suspensions consisted of a relatively homogeneous population of undifferentiated blasts. In culture, tritiated thymidine uptake by the leukemic cells was low during the first 24 hours and then increased (X20) to a peak on day 7. The cell concentration started to increase on day 4. On day 8, less than 10% of the cultured cells still appeared as undifferentiated blasts, whereas up to 60% were granular and 30% to 40% had a monocytoid morphology. Prior to being cultured, the blasts were resistant to resting and IL2-activated natural killing. When the kinetics of in vitro acquired susceptibility were studied, it was found that maximum cytotoxicity against these leukemic cells was reached within 24 hours. Thus, the blasts had become NK-sensitive prior to increase in DNA synthesis, proliferation, and differentiation based on morphological and cytochemical criteria. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between acquired susceptibility and surface expression of an activation antigen, termed TNKtar. To dissect further the mechanisms of acquired susceptibility, a series of six NK clones representing four distinct phenotypes of NK active lymphocytes were tested against the leukemic cells. Immediately after thawing, blasts were essentially resistant to all clones, whereas they were strongly killed by 5 of 6 clones when cultured for 24 hours. Cold target inhibition assays indicated that resistance of fresh blasts was likely to be due to a binding defect. These results suggested that tumor cells became susceptible because they surface-expressed NK target structure(s) in the early phase of an activation process leading to their proliferation and/or differentiation. This hypothesis was substantiated for one clone, termed JT9, because the anti-TNKtar antibody blocked cytotoxicity of JT9 cells against the cultured blasts.","['Moingeon, P', 'Ythier, A', 'Nowill, A', 'Delmon, L', 'Bayle, C', 'Pico, J L', 'Bohuon, C', 'Hercend, T']","['Moingeon P', 'Ythier A', 'Nowill A', 'Delmon L', 'Bayle C', 'Pico JL', 'Bohuon C', 'Hercend T']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cold Temperature', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Mar;67(3):777-83.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,['S0006-4971(20)81390-1 [pii]'],,,,

One is an assay for clonogenic precursors; it depends on their ability to form blast colonies in culture in the presence of methylcellulose and suitable growth factors. The other assesses the growth of blast cells in suspension culture, where growth is measured by increasing numbers of clonogenic cells. We have compared the two methods as assays for the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drug cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Marked patient-to-patient variation was found using either method; however, the slopes of the dose-response curves were usually greater when cells were exposed to drug in suspension rather than in methylcellulose. Control experiments showed that the difference could not be explained by drug carry-over from the suspension cultures to the methylcellulose plates when clonogenic cells in the suspensions were assessed. Further, the survival curves for Adriamycin were very similar, regardless of which assay was used. No correlation was found between D10 Ara-C values measured in suspension or in methylcellulose. However, a significant association with outcome was found between D10 Ara-C in suspension and response to treatment with a regimen in which Ara-C was the only chemotherapeutic agent used. No such association was detected when the D10 values obtained with the clonogenic assay were compared with outcome for the same group of 15 patients. Finally, a feasibility experiment was performed in which blast cells were exposed to Ara-C repeatedly during exponential growth over 238 days. A dose-related inhibition of growth was observed; no evidence was seen of emerging drug-resistant cells. Nor did the morphology of the cells change as a result of drug exposure. We conclude that drug sensitivities of AML blast cells in culture are dependent on measurement methods, even when techniques affecting cell proliferation are compared. Measurements of drug sensitivity in culture may best be interpreted when the bases of the assay systems are understood.","['Nara, N', 'Curtis, J E', 'Senn, J S', 'Tritchler, D L', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Nara N', 'Curtis JE', 'Senn JS', 'Tritchler DL', 'McCulloch EA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methylcellulose', 'Middle Aged', 'Suspensions', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Mar;67(3):762-9.,"['0 (Suspensions)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",,['S0006-4971(20)81388-3 [pii]'],,,,

The cells were labelled with radioactive iron and the pattern of isoferritins was analysed by chromatofocussing. No change was found after iron-loading the cells but after inducing erythroid differentiation with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), iron was incorporated into both more basic and more acidic isoferritins. This was compared to ferritin subunit synthesis; DMSO induced the synthesis of a third, minor subunit whereas iron-loading had no effect. The fate of murine erythroleukaemic cell ferritin iron was followed after incubations in iron-deficient medium containing DMSO; some, but not all, of the ferritin iron was mobilized and used for haem synthesis, and the remaining iron was found amongst the more basic isoferritins. Finally, sequential radioactive iron labels were used to demonstrate that the movement of iron from ferritin to haem was compatible with the 'last-in-first-out' principle, but this could not be related to different isoferritins. These results show firstly that DMSO changes the pattern of isoferritins and ferritin subunits in murine erythroleukaemic cells. Secondly, iron associated with more basic isoferritins seems to be less easily mobilized for haem synthesis.

All of the peripheral blood cell metaphases were Philadelphia chromosome-positive after 24 hours of culture, confirming the diagnosis of chronic myelocytic leukemia, whereas all of the Epstein-Barr virus-treated B lymphocyte metaphases showed a normal karyotype after two weeks of culture. In this patient, analysis of surface antigens and immunoglobulin fractions by flow cytometry proved to be useful in recognizing concomitantly expressed leukemic lineages.

The manifestations, probably fueled by numerous red cell and platelet transfusions, increased at the time of recovery of hematopoiesis. At postmortem examination, characteristic microvascular lesions were found in most organs. Similar thrombotic microangiopathy has been described with mitomycin-based chemotherapy regimens and with the combination of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin.

In addition to a significant increase in phagocytic and nonspecific esterase activities, marked increase of monocyte-specific surface antigens detectable with monoclonal antibodies such as OKM1 and OKM5 was observed in GM3-fed cells. Other sialoglycosphingolipids with the carbohydrate structure belonging to ganglio-series oligosaccharide, ganglioside GM1 and a brain ganglioside mixture, had no effect on the cell differentiation, showing instead stimulatory actions on the growth of these cell lines. We recently demonstrated that the ganglio-series ganglioside GM3 characteristically increased during macrophage-like cell differentiation of these cell lines. The present results indicate that ganglioside molecular species that specifically increase during monocytic cell differentiation of human myeloid and monocytoid leukemic cell lines may play, in turn, an important role in the differentiation-induction of these cell lines along a monocytic cell lineage.","['Nojiri, H', 'Takaku, F', 'Terui, Y', 'Miura, Y', 'Saito, M']","['Nojiri H', 'Takaku F', 'Terui Y', 'Miura Y', 'Saito M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/pharmacology', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/*pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/physiology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Feb;83(3):782-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.3.782.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)']",PMC322949,['10.1073/pnas.83.3.782 [doi]'],,,,
