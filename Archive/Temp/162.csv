The ligand for FLT3 is a transmembrane or soluble protein and is expressed by a variety of cells including hematopoietic and marrow stromal cells; in combination with other growth factors, the ligand stimulates proliferation and development of stem cells, myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells, dendritic cells and natural killer cells. Activation of the receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of various key adaptor proteins known to be involved in different signal transduction pathways that control proliferation, survival and other processes in hematopoietic cells. FLT3 is not only of utmost interest regarding physiological processes of hematopoietic cells but also with regard to pathological aspects, namely leukemogenesis and diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of leukemia. Activating mutations of the receptor have been recognized as the most common genetic abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurring in about 30% of adult cases. AML patients with FLT3 mutations tend to have a poor prognosis, thus FLT3 is an attractive target of therapy, for instance using kinase inhibitors.","['Drexler, Hans G', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar']","['Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Mascheroder Weg 1B, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",22,2004/07/16 05:00,2005/01/07 09:00,['2004/07/16 05:00'],"['2004/07/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08977190410001700989 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2004 Jun;22(2):71-3. doi: 10.1080/08977190410001700989.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However this allogeneic stem cell transplantation carries the risk of severe complications which are partly due to the intensity of the conditioning regimen. Therefore, allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been so far only performed in younger patients with good performance status. Dose-reduced or non-myeloablative conditioning regimen has been proposed as an alternative that would allow exploiting the graft versus leukemia effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation without severe toxicity. Clinical studies have shown that dose-reduced conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation allows stable engraftment with lower toxicities which can be associated with long-term disease control. Therefore, dose-reduced conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be offered to older and more debilitated patients who were no candidates for standard allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Kroger, N']",['Kroger N'],"['Knochenmarktransplantation, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Ther Umsch,Therapeutische Umschau.

Ginsenoside aglycones 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PD), 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PT), and ginsenoside Rh2 have been identified as having a strong effect on reducing cell viability. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rh2 is thought to be a rare ginsenoside not found in all ginseng products. Rather, Rh2 has been recently reported to be a breakdown product of thermal processing of North American ginseng. In this study, pure ginsenosides PD, PT, Rh2 standards and an enriched Rh2 fraction derived from ginseng leaf were tested in cultured Caco-2 cells for relative cytotoxic potency. PD and Rh2 LC50 were similar after 24 to 72 h, whereas a drop in PT LC50 occurred later at 48 and 72 h. Furthermore, PD and Rh2 affected membrane integrity as indicated by LDH secretion earlier than PT and the enriched Rh2 fraction (P < or = 0.05). Ginsenoside Rh2 showed the greatest (P < or = 0.05) build up of necrotic cells (18.3 +/- 0.1%) at the respective LC50 after 24 h and PD (21.3 +/- 0.3%) showed the largest effect after 44 h of exposure. The effect on apoptotic cells at 44 h of treatment were significantly different (P < or = 0.05) for Rh2 (21 +/- 0.4%), PD (14.6 +/- 0.1%), enriched Rh2 leaf fraction (9.9 +/- 0.6%), and PT (2.3 +/- 0.1%) treatments. Caco-2 caspase-3 activity was different between ginsenoside exposure; Rh2 (10.6 +/- 0.3 nM pNA) had the greatest (P < or = 0.05) activity followed by the enriched Rh2 leaf fraction (8.3 +/- 0.2 nM pNA), PT (7.3 +/- 0.3 nM pNA). The PD (4.8 +/- 0.04 nM pNA) treatment was similar to untreated cells (4.3 +/- 0.05 nM pNA) in caspase-3 activity. These results show variable bioactive response in cultured intestinal cell to specific ginsenosides and an enriched Rh2 North American ginseng extract which may be explained on basis of hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance.","['Popovich, David G', 'Kitts, David D']","['Popovich DG', 'Kitts DD']","['Food, Nutrition and Health, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sapogenins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '78214-33-2 (ginsenoside Rh2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'P6717R7BP8 (protopanaxadiol)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Ginsenosides/chemistry/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Panax/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Sapogenins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Time Factors', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*toxicity']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.20019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2004;18(3):143-9. doi: 10.1002/jbt.20019.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological activity of these compounds was quantified using the in vitro cytotoxicity assay against the L1210 Murine leukaemia cell line. Large variation in cytotoxicities with different methylation was observed. The 5- and 5,6-methylated derivatives of phen displayed a greater biological activity, with IC50 values of 2.8 +/- 0.8 microM and 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM respectively, compared with the phen compound, with an IC50 value of 9.7 +/- 0.3 microM, while all the others were inactive with IC50 values over 50 microM. Binding constants were determined using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and induced circular dichroism (ICD). ICD was used to highlight any differences in the spectra.

The binding of the platinum(II) complexes to the oligonucleotide d(GTCGAC)2 was studied using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. The addition of each metal complex to the hexamer d(GTCGAC)2 produced upfield shifts of the metal complex resonances, characteristic of intercalation.

We and others have shown that selenite induces apoptotic DNA laddering in the p53-mutant DU145 prostate cancer cells and the p53-null HL60 leukemia cells without the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; i.e., caspase-independent apoptosis), whereas selenium compounds leading to the formation of methylselenol induce caspase-mediated apoptosis in these cells. Because selenite induces DNA single strand breaks, and because certain types of DNA damage activate p53, we investigated whether the human LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which contain a wild-type p53, execute selenite-induced apoptosis through caspase pathways. The results showed that exposure of LNCaP cells for 24 hours to lower micromolar concentrations of selenite led to DNA laddering, and to the cleavage of PARP and several pro-caspases. In contrast to this apoptosis sensitivity, LNCaP cells were rather resistant to similar concentrations of the methylselenol precursor methylseleninic acid. Selenite treatment led to a significant increase in p53 phosphorylation on Ser-15 (Ser15P). Time course experiments showed that p53 Ser15P occurred several hours before caspase activation and PARP cleavage. The general caspase inhibitor zVADfmk completely blocked PARP cleavage, and significantly decreased DNA laddering, but did not affect p53 Ser15P. An inhibitor for caspase-8 was equally as protective as that for caspase-9 against the selenite-induced apoptosis. Attenuating p53 by a chemical inhibitor pifithrin-alpha decreased the selenite-induced p53 Ser15P and led to concordant reductions of PARP cleavage and apoptosis. In summary, selenite-induced p53 Ser15P appeared to be important for activating the caspase-mediated apoptosis involving both the caspase-8 and the caspase-9 pathways in the LNCaP cells.","['Jiang, Cheng', 'Hu, Hongbo', 'Malewicz, Barbara', 'Wang, Zaisen', 'Lu, Junxuan']","['Jiang C', 'Hu H', 'Malewicz B', 'Wang Z', 'Lu J']","['Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'D213B92S1Y (pifithrin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Toluene/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2005/03/01 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['3/7/877 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Jul;3(7):877-84.,,,,,['CA92231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that the transcription repressor Daxx and the SWI/SNF protein ATRX are both associated with two intranuclear domains: ND10/PML bodies and heterochromatin. The accumulation of ATRX at nuclear domain 10 (ND10) was mediated by its interaction with the N-terminus of Daxx. Binding of this complex to ND10 was facilitated by the interaction of the Daxx C-terminus with SUMOylated promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Although ATRX was present at heterochromatin during the entire cell cycle, Daxx was actively recruited to this domain at the end of S-phase. The FACT-complex member structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) accumulated at heterochromatin simultaneously with Daxx and accumulation of both proteins depended on ATRX phosphorylation. Both Daxx and SSRP1 were released from heterochromatin early in G(2) phase and Daxx was recruited back to ND10, indicating that both proteins localize to heterochromatin during a very short temporal window of the cell cycle. ATRX seems to assemble a repression multiprotein complex including Daxx and SSRP1 at heterochromatin during a specific stage of the cell cycle, whereas Daxx functions as an adapter for ATRX accumulation at ND10. A potential functional consequence of Daxx accumulation at heterochromatin was found in the S- to G(2)-phase transition. In Daxx(-/-) cells, S-phase was accelerated and the propensity to form double nuclei was increased, functional changes that could be rescued by Daxx reconstitution and that might be the basis for the developmental problems observed in Daxx knockout animals.","['Ishov, Alexander M', 'Vladimirova, Olga V', 'Maul, Gerd G']","['Ishov AM', 'Vladimirova OV', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (SNF1-related protein kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Atrx protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase', 'Heterochromatin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'S Phase', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/jcs.01230 [doi]', 'jcs.01230 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2004 Aug 1;117(Pt 17):3807-20. doi: 10.1242/jcs.01230.

In this report we investigated the involvement of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton-dependent polarization and motility of a non-adherent IL-3-dependent murine pre-B lymphocytic cell line Baf3. We also assessed the effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a phorbol ester analogous to those currently in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia, on paxillin phosphorylation. Using tyrosine-to-phenylalanine phosphorylation mutants of paxillin and phosphospecific antibody we demonstrated that IL-3 stimulated phosphorylation of paxillin tyrosine residues 31 and 118, whereas the tyrosines 40 and 181 were constitutively phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of paxillin residues 31 and 118 was required for cell polarization and motility. In the presence of IL-3, PMA dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of residues 31 and 118, which was accompanied by inhibition of cell polarization and motility. This PMA effect was partially recapitulated by expression of exogenous tyrosine 31 and 118 mutants of paxillin. We also demonstrated that PMA inhibited the IL-3-induced and activation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Thus, our results indicate that phosphorylation of paxillin tyrosine residues 31 and 118 regulates actin-dependent polarization and motility of pre-B Baf3 cells, both of which could be inhibited by PMA. They also suggest that inhibition of upstream signaling by PMA contributes to the decrease of paxillin phosphorylation and subsequent changes in cell morphology.","['Romanova, Larisa Y', 'Hashimoto, Shigeru', 'Chay, Kee-Oh', 'Blagosklonny, Mikhail V', 'Sabe, Hisataka', 'Mushinski, J Frederic']","['Romanova LY', 'Hashimoto S', 'Chay KO', 'Blagosklonny MV', 'Sabe H', 'Mushinski JF']","['Molecular Genetics Section, Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. iromanova@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (PXN protein, human)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pxn protein, mouse)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*chemistry']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2005/04/05 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/jcs.01206 [doi]', 'jcs.01206 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2004 Aug 1;117(Pt 17):3759-68. doi: 10.1242/jcs.01206.

A single HLA allele or antigen mismatch was associated with increased mortality among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) within 2 years after diagnosis compared to patients with no HLA mismatch, but not among those with more advanced malignancy. In particular, a single HLA-C mismatch conferred increased risk of mortality compared to matches. There was a suggestion for increased mortality with multiple mismatches involving HLA-DQB1 compared to multiple mismatches not involving HLA-DQB1. Donors with a single HLA allele or antigen mismatch may be used for HCT when a fully matched donor is not available for patients with diseases that do not permit time for a lengthy search.

We used DNA microarrays to identify gene expression profiles related to FLT3 status and outcome in childhood AML.

In addition, 8 of 19 specimens from patients with relapses had FLT3-MUs. Predictive analysis of microarrays (PAM) identified genes that differentiated FLT3-ITD from FLT3-ALM and FLT3 wild-type (FLT3-WT) cases. Among the 42 specimens with FLT3-MUs, PAM identified 128 genes that correlated with clinical outcome. Event-free survival (EFS) in FLT3-MU patients with a favorable signature was 45% versus 5% for those with an unfavorable signature (P = .018). Among FLT3-MU specimens, high expression of the RUNX3 gene and low expression of the ATRX gene were associated with inferior outcome. The ratio of RUNX3 to ATRX expression was used to classify FLT3-MU cases into 3 EFS groups: 70%, 37%, and 0% for low, intermediate, and high ratios, respectively (P < .0001). Thus, gene expression profiling identified AML patients with divergent prognoses within the FLT3-MU group, and the RUNX3 to ATRX expression ratio should be a useful prognostic indicator in these patients.","['Lacayo, Norman J', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Kinnunen, Paivi', 'Yu, Ron', 'Wang, Yan', 'Stuber, Christianna M', 'Douglas, Lorrie', 'Wahab, Romina', 'Becton, David L', 'Weinstein, Howard', 'Chang, Myron N', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Tibshirani, Robert', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Sikic, Branimir I', 'Dahl, Gary V']","['Lacayo NJ', 'Meshinchi S', 'Kinnunen P', 'Yu R', 'Wang Y', 'Stuber CM', 'Douglas L', 'Wahab R', 'Becton DL', 'Weinstein H', 'Chang MN', 'Willman CL', 'Radich JP', 'Tibshirani R', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Sikic BI', 'Dahl GV']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'DNA Helicases/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4449 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55928-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Nov 1;104(9):2646-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4449.

However, the intended chronic oral administration of imatinib may lead to development of cellular resistance and subsequent treatment failure. Indeed, several molecular mechanisms leading to imatinib resistance have already been reported, including overexpression of the MDR1/ABCB1 drug pump. We examined whether imatinib is a substrate for the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 drug pump that is frequently overexpressed in human tumors. Using a panel of well-defined BCRP-overexpressing cell lines, we provide the first evidence that imatinib is a substrate for BCRP, that it competes with mitoxantrone for drug export, and that BCRP-mediated efflux can be reversed by the fumitremorgin C analog Ko-143. Since BCRP is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, BCRP might not only play a role in cellular resistance of tumor cells but also influence the gastrointestinal absorption of imatinib.","['Burger, Herman', 'van Tol, Hans', 'Boersma, Antonius W M', 'Brok, Mariel', 'Wiemer, Erik A C', 'Stoter, Gerrit', 'Nooter, Kees']","['Burger H', 'van Tol H', 'Boersma AW', 'Brok M', 'Wiemer EA', 'Stoter G', 'Nooter K']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Daniel den Hoed Kliniek/Josephine Nefkens Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. h.burger@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mitoxantrone/metabolism', 'Mycotoxins/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-04-1398 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55969-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Nov 1;104(9):2940-2. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1398.

RESULTS: Acromegaly is associated with several comorbid conditions. Among these is a higher incidence of several types of visceral malignant lesions, especially carcinoma of the colon. Growth hormone stimulates the hepatic production of somatomedins, such as insulin-like growth factors, which are known promoters of human growth and have also been implicated in tumorigenesis. In recent years, several cases of lymphoproliferative diseases have also been noted in patients with acromegaly. These conditions include multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia; three previous cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been described. In our patient, a 57-year-old man with acromegaly, magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland disclosed a large intrasellar mass. Large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed. Six months of chemotherapy yielded complete remission. CONCLUSION: An additional case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a patient with acromegaly supports the accumulating evidence of an increased risk for development of cancer in such patients.","['Alves, R H', 'Vaisman, M', 'Brasil, R R', 'Gadelha, M R']","['Alves RH', 'Vaisman M', 'Brasil RR', 'Gadelha MR']","['Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Clementino Fraga Filho, University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocr Pract,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,9607439,,,,,2004/07/15 05:00,2004/07/15 05:01,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:01 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1530-891X(20)40709-8 [pii]', '10.4158/EP.4.5.279 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Pract. 1998 Sep-Oct;4(5):279-81. doi: 10.4158/EP.4.5.279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ds/siRNAs were transfected into bcr-abl-positive K-562 (derived from blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia), using lipofectamine. Penetrating of ds/siRNAs into the cells was detected by fluorescent confocal microscopy, using fluorescein-labeled ds/siRNAs. The cells were treated with mix of three siRNA sequences (3 x 60 nM) during 6 days with three repetitive transfections. The siRNA-treatment was accompanied with significant reduction of bcr-abl mRNA, p210, protein tyrosine kinase activity and cell proliferation index. Treatment of cells with Glivec (during 8 days with four repetitive doses, 180 nM single dose) resulted in analogous reduction of cell proliferation activity, stronger suppression of protein tyrosine kinase activity, and very low reduction of p210. siRNA-mix and Glivec did not affect significantly the viability of normal lymphocytes. Microarray analysis of siRNA- and Glivec-treated K-562 cells demonstrated that both pathways of bcr-abl suppression were accompanied with overexpression and suppression of many different oncogenes, apoptotic/antiapoptotic and cell proliferation factors.

Accurate determination of RTX concentrations in patient plasmas is important for proper dosing of patients and for correlating RTX concentrations with clinical responses. There is currently no assay available for RTX which utilizes easily obtainable commercial reagents. Therefore, we sought to develop such an assay, and in this report we describe three new assays for RTX concentration. One assay, based on flow cytometry, quantitates immunologically active RTX based on its ability to bind to CD20 on Raji cells. Two other methods, based on flow cytometry and ELISA, measure RTX based on its antigenic properties. The assays are accurate, in good agreement with one another, and can all measure RTX concentrations as low as approximately 1 microg/ml in both sera and plasmas. Use of these assays reveals that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients receiving RTX treatment have lower plasma RTX concentrations than patients with other B cell lymphomas at all times over the usual 4-week course of therapy. The level in CLL plasmas often declines to <1 microg/ml RTX 1 week after each RTX infusion, substantially lower than the values found in comparable non-CLL patient plasmas. RTX assay results also demonstrate that naive CLL patient plasmas do not have levels of non-cell associated CD20 sufficient to either interfere with an in vitro assay of RTX or to block the potential therapeutic action of RTX in vivo.","['Beum, Paul V', 'Kennedy, Adam D', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Beum PV', 'Kennedy AD', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville, 22908-0733, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*blood/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens/blood', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*blood/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Plasma/immunology', 'Rituximab', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum/immunology']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2006/07/28 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jim.2004.03.012 [doi]', 'S0022175904001206 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2004 Jun;289(1-2):97-109. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2004.03.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of matched sibling donors, alternative donors such as unrelated and/or partially matched family sources remain risky, yet the only available, options. Herein we report the results of HCT from alternative donors in 14 children with different subtypes of MDS (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia [JMML] n = 9; myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] refractory anemia n = 3; MDS refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation n = 2) transplanted at our institution. The median time from diagnosis to HCT was 9 months (range 4 to 90 months). The variety of HCT types included: unrelated peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT) (n = 2), partially matched family donor T-cell-repleted BMT/PBPCT (n = 6), and haploidentical T-cell-depleted PBPCT (n = 6). Five of 14 patients remain alive at 7 to 37 months posttransplant (including two patients after partially matched family donor BMT, two patients after haploidentical T-cell-depleted-PBPCT, and one after unrelated-PBPCT, respectively). The major complications were: primary graft failure in the haploidentical T-cell-depleted-setting or graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in T-cell-repleted partially matched family or unrelated settings, respectively. Despite the high transplant-related mortality rate in this series, allogeneic HCT from alternative donors remains an interesting solution for children with MDS who lack matched sibling donors. Due to improved immune reconstitution, despite an increased risk of GvHD, T-cell-repleted transplants from single HLA-mismatched family donors remain a valuable option for children without matched donors. Splenectomy prior to HCT may positively affect the posttransplant course in patients with overt splenomegaly for example those afflicted with JMML.","['Kalwak, K', 'Wojcik, D', 'Gorczynska, E', 'Toporski, J', 'Turkiewicz, D', 'Slociak, M', 'Ussowicz, M', 'Pajdosz, K', 'Socha, P', 'Chybicka, A']","['Kalwak K', 'Wojcik D', 'Gorczynska E', 'Toporski J', 'Turkiewicz D', 'Slociak M', 'Ussowicz M', 'Pajdosz K', 'Socha P', 'Chybicka A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Wroclaw University of Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland. kk@pedhemat.am.wroc.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Siblings', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.05.081 [doi]', 'S0041134504006359 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2004 Jun;36(5):1574-7. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2004.05.081.,,['Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene, when transcribed, produces the BCR-Abl oncoprotein which has tyrosine kinase activity and the ability to prevent apoptosis, but has no effect on cellular proliferation. Imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the BCR-Abl transcript modelled on the ATP binding pocket of the Abl oncoprotein, prevents phosphorylation of effector molecules and induces apoptosis. Imatinib has limited effectiveness when BCR-Abl cells are in the quiescent cell-cycle state of G0. A life-long regimen of imatinib should reduce the risk of relapse from cells leaving G0. Up-regulation of BCR-Abl expression, ATP binding pocket mutations, up-regulation of MDR1 and over-expression of Pgp are all thought to limit the effectiveness of imatinib. Advanced BCR-Abl positivity is associated with complex mutations, which are thought to have a cumulative effect on the BCR-Abl oncoprotein in disrupting normal signal transduction, making these cells refractory to monotherapy alone. Combination therapy is thought to overcome this. Research studies have identified imatinib as a potential treatment option for a diverse range of malignancies associated with BCR-Abl, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFr) and c-Kit pathways. This may extend the application of this special therapy in the future.","['Knight, G W A', 'McLellan, D']","['Knight GW', 'McLellan D']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, Dorset, UK. gwaknight@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",45,2004/07/15 05:00,2004/10/13 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09674845.2004.11732653 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2004;61(2):103-11. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2004.11732653.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HL-60 cells in vitro in culture medium were given different concentrations of oridonin. The inhibitory rate of cells were measured by microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell apoptotic rate was detected by flow cytometry (FCM), morphology of cell apoptosis was observed by hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining, and the activity of telomerase was detected using telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) PCR-ELISA before and after apoptosis occurred. RESULTS: Oridonin could decrease telomerase activity, inhibit growth of HL-60 cells, and cause apoptosis significantly. The suppression was both in time- and dose-dependent manner. Marked morphological changes of cell apoptosis including condensation of chromatin and nuclear fragmentation were observed clearly by hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining especially after cells were treated 48-60 hours by oridonin. CONCLUSIONS: Oridonin has apparent anti-proliferation and apoptotic effects on HL-60 cells in vitro, decreasing telomerase activity of HL-60 cells may be one of its most important mechanisms. These results will provide strong laboratory evidence of oridonin for clinical treatment of acute leukemia.","['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Wu, Xin-Yao', 'Lul, Hui-Ling', 'Pan, Xiang-Lin', 'Peng, Jun', 'Huang, Ren-Wei']","['Liu JJ', 'Wu XY', 'Lul HL', 'Pan XL', 'Peng J', 'Huang RW']","['Laboratory of Forensic and Biological Science, Medical College of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med Sci J,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,9112559,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isodon/chemistry', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",,2004/07/15 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/07/15 05:00'],"['2004/07/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med Sci J. 2004 Jun;19(2):134-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytokines were tested at equimolar concentrations from 0.078 to 10 nM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT1, the STAT-dependent suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 promoter activity, SOCS-3 gene expression, STAT-dependent POMC promoter activity and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion were determined. RESULTS: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), human oncostatin M (OSM) and cardiotrophin (CT)-1 (LIFR/gp130 ligands), as well as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and novel neurotrophin-1/B-cell stimulating factor-3 (CNTFR alpha/LIFR/gp130 ligands) are potent stimuli of corticotroph cells in vitro. In comparison, interleukin (IL)-6 (IL-6R/gp130 ligand) and IL-11 (IL-11R/gp130 ligand) exhibited only modest direct effects on corticotrophs, while murine OSM (OSMR/gp130 ligand) showed no effect. CONCLUSION: (i) CNTFR complex ligands are potent stimuli of corticotroph function, comparable to LIFR complex ligands; (ii) IL-6 and IL-11 are relatively weak direct stimuli of corticotroph function; (iii) differential effects of human and murine OSM suggest that LIFR/gp130 (OSMR type I) but not OSMR/gp130 (OSMR type II) are involved in corticotroph signaling. (iv) CT-1 has the hitherto unknown ability to stimulate corticotroph function, and (v) despite redundant immuno-neuroendocrine effects of different gp130 cytokines, corticotroph cells are preferably activated through the LIFR and CNTFR complexes.","['Auernhammer, Christoph J', 'Kopp, Florian B', 'Vlotides, George', 'Dorn, Franziska', 'Isele, Nicola B', 'Spottl, Gerald', 'Cengic, Neziha', 'Weber, Matthias M', 'Senaldi, Giorgio', 'Engelhardt, Dieter']","['Auernhammer CJ', 'Kopp FB', 'Vlotides G', 'Dorn F', 'Isele NB', 'Spottl G', 'Cengic N', 'Weber MM', 'Senaldi G', 'Engelhardt D']","['Medizinische Klinik II, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.

After relapse, 10 children received an intensive relapse therapy (AML-BFM 97 or international AML-Relapse Study 2001/01). 2 of them had been transplanted in first or second CR before GO therapy. RESULTS: 5 of 12 children responded to treatment with blast reduction to below 5%, but no child achieved CR after GO. Time until reoccurrence of blasts in almost all children with GO response was 3-8 months. In 5 children stem cell transplantation (SCT) was performed after GO therapy. 4 of them suffered from further progression of AML, 1 boy is in second remission with a follow-up of 8 months. 2 children had severe side effects. An anaphylactic reaction with severe hypotension was managed by catecholamine support and intensive care. In 1 girl, who relapsed after SCT in first remission, a veno-occlusive disease of the liver occurred, but could be treated successfully with defibrotide. CONCLUSION: GO therapy can induce blast reduction in children who have no further conventional treatment options. Frequency and severity of adverse events are limited, and therapy seems to be feasible for children with a sufficient general condition. Controlled studies are necessary to learn more about efficacy and side effects, especially implications for further therapy.","['Reinhardt, D', 'Diekamp, S', 'Fleischhack, G', 'Corbacioglu, C', 'Jurgens, H', 'Dworzak, M', 'Kaspers, G', 'Creutzig, U', 'Zwaan, C M']","['Reinhardt D', 'Diekamp S', 'Fleischhack G', 'Corbacioglu C', 'Jurgens H', 'Dworzak M', 'Kaspers G', 'Creutzig U', 'Zwaan CM']","[""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Germany. dreinh@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/07/14 05:00,2004/08/19 05:00,['2004/07/14 05:00'],"['2004/07/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000075606 [doi]', '75606 [pii]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2004 Jun;27(3):269-72. doi: 10.1159/000075606.,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

In some cell lines, cross-saturation experiments suggest that the two viruses are interacting with the same restriction factor. Recently, Trim5alpha protein from rhesus monkey was found to restrict HIV-1. We have confirmed this result and have shown that Trim5alpha from two African green monkey cell lines, Vero and CV-1, also restricts HIV-1. In addition, we show that human, rhesus, and African green monkey Trim5alpha can restrict N-MLV. By using a panel of MLV capsid mutants, subtle differences in the anti-MLV activity were identified among the different primate Trim5alpha cDNAs. Trim1 isolated from humans and green monkeys was also found to restrict N-MLV. We hypothesize that the Trim family of proteins plays a widespread role in innate immunity to viral infection.","['Yap, Melvyn W', 'Nisole, Sebastien', 'Lynch, Clare', 'Stoye, Jonathan P']","['Yap MW', 'Nisole S', 'Lynch C', 'Stoye JP']","['Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TRAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', '*Virus Replication']",,2004/07/14 05:00,2004/08/27 05:00,['2004/07/14 05:00'],"['2004/07/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0402876101 [doi]', '0402876101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jul 20;101(29):10786-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0402876101.

Disruption of TRIM5alpha expression in human and AGM cells with small interfering RNA rescues infectivity of restricted virus without affecting unrestricted virus. We also demonstrate that the activity of the murine restriction factor Fv1 depends on TRIM5alpha expression when Fv1 is expressed in human cells. Furthermore, a drug that modifies the behavior of the related promyelocytic leukemia protein PML specifically rescues infection by viruses restricted by human TRIM5alpha. Alignment of the TRIM5alpha proteins from rhesus macaque and AGM indicates an 18-aa insertion. We speculate that this insertion may contribute to the broader specificity of the AGM TRIM5alpha restriction as compared with the human and rhesus macaque proteins.","['Keckesova, Zuzana', 'Ylinen, Laura M J', 'Towers, Greg J']","['Keckesova Z', 'Ylinen LM', 'Towers GJ']","['Wohl Virion Center, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London W1T 4JF, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops/*genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxides/metabolism', 'R Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2004/07/14 05:00,2004/08/27 05:00,['2004/07/14 05:00'],"['2004/07/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0402474101 [doi]', '0402474101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jul 20;101(29):10780-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0402474101.

Here we show that lentivirus susceptibility factor 1 and Ref1 are species-specific variants of tripartite interaction motif 5alpha (TRIM5alpha), a cytoplasmic body component recently shown to block HIV-1 infection in rhesus macaque cells, and can indeed block infection by widely divergent retroviruses. Depletion of TRIM5alpha from human cells relieved restriction of N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), and expression of human TRIM5alpha in otherwise nonrestricting cells conferred specific resistance to N-MLV infection, indicating that TRIM5alpha is Ref1 or an essential component of Ref1. TRIM5alpha variants from humans, rhesus monkeys, and African green monkeys displayed different but overlapping restriction specificities that were quite accurately predicted by the restriction properties of the cells from which they were derived. All TRIM5alpha variants could inhibit infection by at least two different retroviruses, and African green monkey TRIM5alpha was able to inhibit infection by no less than four divergent retroviruses of human, non-human primate, equine, and murine origin. However, each TRIM5alpha variant was unable to restrict retroviruses isolated from the same species. These data indicate that TRIM5alpha can confer broad innate immunity to retrovirus infection in primate cells and is likely to be an important natural barrier to cross-species retrovirus transmission.","['Hatziioannou, Theodora', 'Perez-Caballero, David', 'Yang, Annie', 'Cowan, Simone', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Hatziioannou T', 'Perez-Caballero D', 'Yang A', 'Cowan S', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2004/07/14 05:00,2004/08/27 05:00,['2004/07/14 05:00'],"['2004/07/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0402361101 [doi]', '0402361101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jul 20;101(29):10774-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0402361101.

However, the reports on the function of BP1 in solid tumors are rare. The study was designed to determine the expression of BP1 gene in breast cancer and to analyze its relationship with various clinicopathological factors. METHODS: With beta-actin gene as a reference, BP1 mRNA expression was detected in 82 breast cancer tissues and 12 near adjacent tissues and 10 far adjacent tissues using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The expression rates of BP1 in near and far adjacent tissues were 16.67% (2/12) and 0% (0/10), respectively; while the expression rate in breast cancer group was 64.63% (53/82). There were statistically significant differences among the three groups (P< 0.05). Overexpression of BP1 in breast cancer was correlated with histological grade (P< 0.05). Nevertheless, no correlation was found between BP1 expression and other clinicopathological factors, including tumor size, lymph nodal metastasis, family history, pathological type, menarcheal age, primiparous age, number of pregnancy, menopausal status, ER status and PR status (P >0.05).

Approximately 7.1 x 10(3) platelets/microL/d are postulated to be randomly used in maintaining vascular integrity. Thus, in clinically stable patients, major bleeding is unusual unless the platelet count is </=5 x 10(3)/microL. Risk factors for bleeding at higher platelet counts are disseminated intravascular coagulation with contributory clotting factor deficiencies, structural lesions with loss of vascular integrity, and refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Several large studies have documented the safety of lowering the prophylactic platelet transfusion trigger from the previously used 20 x 10(3)/microL to 10 x 10(3)/microL. A few studies have even suggested that a 5 x 10(3)/microL trigger is acceptable. Based on these results, the next step of giving just therapeutic platelet transfusions is being evaluated. In a large retrospective study, the most significant predictor of bleeding was not the patient's platelet count but a history of bleeding in the prior 5 days. These data suggest that attention should be focused on providing aggressive platelet therapy for active bleeding rather than transfusing platelets prophylactically.

Since antioxidants and TSA (the specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase) are believed to combat cancer via different mechanisms, we sought to determine whether combining them would improve their anticancer activity in human leukemia cells (HL-60). MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with antioxidants (ascorbic acid, AA and N-acetyl-cysteine, NAC), TSA or their combination, and cell proliferation arrest, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cell viability were measured as indicators of cell damage. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the acetylation of histones were also measured. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of AA, NAC and TSA increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. AA (1, 2 and 4 mM) and NAC (0.2, 0.5 and 1 mM) were able to diminish ROS generation but showed no influence on histone acetylation in HL-60 cells. In contrast, TSA (20, 50, 100 and 200 nM) did not inhibit ROS generation but significantly increased histone acetylation, indicating a possible role for both scavenging ROS and increasing histone acetylation in the induction of cell death in HL-60 cells. This conclusion was further confirmed by the finding that the combination of antioxidant and TSA not only diminished ROS generation, but also increased histone acetylation, and hence showed greater cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells than either component alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that combining antioxidants and TSA can enhance their neoplastic toxicity at least in human leukemia HL-60 cells, providing a new approach to the design of chemotherapy strategies and the development of anticancer drugs.","['Kang, Jiuhong', 'Chen, Jie', 'Zhang, Dawei', 'Da, Wanming', 'Ou, Yingxian']","['Kang J', 'Chen J', 'Zhang D', 'Da W', 'Ou Y']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China. kangjiuhong@lzu.edu.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis']",,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0845-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Dec;54(6):537-45. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0845-7.

Dexrazoxane, a free-radical scavenger, may protect the heart from doxorubicin-associated damage. METHODS: To determine whether dexrazoxane decreases doxorubicin-associated injury of cardiomyocytes, we randomly assigned 101 children with ALL to receive doxorubicin alone (30 mg per square meter of body-surface area every three weeks for 10 doses) and 105 to receive dexrazoxane (300 mg per square meter) followed immediately by doxorubicin. Serial measurements of serum cardiac troponin T were obtained in 76 of 101 patients in the doxorubicin group and 82 of 105 patients in the group given dexrazoxane and doxorubicin. A total of 2377 serum samples (mean, 15.1 samples per patient) were obtained before, during, and after treatment with doxorubicin. Troponin T levels were evaluated in a blinded fashion to determine whether they were elevated (>0.01 ng per milliliter)--the primary end point--or extremely elevated (>0.025 ng per milliliter). RESULTS: Elevations of troponin T occurred in 35 percent of the patients (55 of 158). Patients treated with doxorubicin alone were more likely than those who received dexrazoxane and doxorubicin to have elevated troponin T levels (50 percent vs. 21 percent, P<0.001) and extremely elevated troponin T levels (32 percent vs. 10 percent, P<0.001). The median follow-up was 2.7 years. The rate of event-free survival at 2.5 years was 83 percent in both groups (P=0.87 by the log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Dexrazoxane prevents or reduces cardiac injury, as reflected by elevations in troponin T, that is associated with the use of doxorubicin for childhood ALL without compromising the antileukemic efficacy of doxorubicin. Longer follow-up will be necessary to determine the influence of dexrazoxane on echocardiographic findings at four years and on event-free survival.","['Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Rifai, Nader', 'Dalton, Virginia M', 'Levy, Donna E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Colan, Steven D', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Hurwitz, Craig A', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Samson, Yvan', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Sallan, Stephen E']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Rifai N', 'Dalton VM', 'Levy DE', 'Silverman LB', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Colan SD', 'Asselin BL', 'Barr RD', 'Clavell LA', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Moghrabi A', 'Samson Y', 'Schorin MA', 'Gelber RD', 'Sallan SE']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami School of Medicine, Holtz Children's Hospital of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami 33101, USA. slipshultz@med.miami.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cardiovascular Agents)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Troponin T)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiomyopathies/blood/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Cardiovascular Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chelating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Razoxane/*therapeutic use', 'Troponin T/*blood', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects']",,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa035153 [doi]', '351/2/145 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2004 Jul 8;351(2):145-53. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa035153.,,['Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,"['CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 79060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 53392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59837/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 72705/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HR96041/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['N Engl J Med. 2004 Jul 8;351(2):120-1.

To examine how signal transduction controls the gene expression program required for progenitor expansion, we screened ATLAS filters with polysome-associated mRNA derived from erythroid progenitors stimulated with erythropoietin and/or stem cell factor. The putative proto-oncogene nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (ndpk-B or nm23-M2) was identified as an erythropoietin and stem cell factor target gene. Factor-induced expression of nm23-M2 was regulated specifically at the level of polysome association by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Identification of the transcription initiation site revealed that nm23-M2 mRNA starts with a terminal oligopyrimidine sequence, which is known to render mRNA translation dependent on mitogenic factors. Recently, the nm23-M2 locus was identified as a common leukemia retrovirus integration site, suggesting that it plays a role in leukemia development. The expression of Nm23 from a retroviral vector in the absence of its 5'-untranslated region caused constitutive polysome association of nm23-M2. Polysome-association and protein expression of endogenous nm23-M2 declined during differentiation of erythroid progenitors, suggesting a role for Nm23-M2 in progenitor expansion. Taken together, nm23-m2 exemplifies that cytokine-dependent control of translation initiation is an important mechanism of gene expression regulation.","['Joosten, Marieke', 'Blazquez-Domingo, Montserrat', 'Lindeboom, Fokke', 'Boulme, Florence', 'Van Hoven-Beijen, Antoinette', 'Habermann, Bianca', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Beug, Hartmut', 'Mullner, Ernst W', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Von Lindern, Marieke']","['Joosten M', 'Blazquez-Domingo M', 'Lindeboom F', 'Boulme F', 'Van Hoven-Beijen A', 'Habermann B', 'Lowenberg B', 'Beug H', 'Mullner EW', 'Delwel R', 'Von Lindern M']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, P.

While both human and animal studies have linked several chemical carcinogens to specific ras mutations, little data exist regarding the association of ras mutations with parental exposures and risk of childhood leukemia. Using data from a large case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; age <15 years) conducted by the Children's Cancer Group, we used a case-case comparison approach to examine whether reported parental exposure to hydrocarbons at work or use of specific medications are related to ras gene mutations in the leukemia cells of children with ALL. DNA was extracted from archived bone marrow slides or cryopreserved marrow samples for 837 ALL cases. We examined mutations in K-ras and N-ras genes at codons 12, 13, and 61 by PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and confirmed them by DNA sequencing. We interviewed mothers and, if available, fathers by telephone to collect exposure information. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from logistic regression to examine the association of parental exposures with ras mutations. A total of 127 (15.2%) cases had ras mutations (K-ras 4.7% and N-ras 10.68%). Both maternal (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7-6.1) and paternal (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) reported use of mind-altering drugs were associated with N-ras mutations. Paternal use of amphetamines or diet pills was associated with N-ras mutations (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-15.0); no association was observed with maternal use. Maternal exposure to solvents (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.7) and plastic materials (OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.2-39.7) during pregnancy and plastic materials after pregnancy (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.4-48.8) were related to K-ras mutation. Maternal ever exposure to oil and coal products before case diagnosis (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.8) and during the postnatal period (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-5.5) and paternal exposure to plastic materials before index pregnancy (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.1) and other hydrocarbons during the postnatal period (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-1.3) were associated with N-ras mutations.

Development of pigmentary abnormalities can be observed in sites where acute cutaneous GVHD has occurred, and usually consists of hyperpigmented spots. We observed atypical pigmetary changes consisting of a combination of hyper- and hypopigmentation, so called leukomelanoderma, in a young allogeneic bone marrow recipient who suffered repetitive acute GVHD. The histopathological examinations showed features of a post-inflammatory process. Because keratinocytes produce inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1alpha, which may be implicated in the inflammatory phenomena seen in acute GVHD, we studied whether these inflammatory cytokines might be implicated in these pigmentary changes. The cytokines tested were IL-1alpha, IL-2, TNF-alpha and IL-10. The expression of TNF-alpha increased in the hyperpigmented skin relative to normal and hypopigmented skin. While TNF-alpha was variably distributed in proportion to different degrees of pigmentation, other molecules were detected at minimal levels in all samples. This observation may indicate that the production of TNF-alpha by epidermal microenvironment may be involved in postinflammatory pigmentary changes.","['Kang, Hee Young', 'Kang, Won Hyoung']","['Kang HY', 'Kang WH']","['Department of Dermatology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, 442-721, Korea, Republic of Korea. hykang@ajou.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Dermatol,European journal of dermatology : EJD,9206420,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Face', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Melanosis/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Thorax', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Dermatol. 2004 May-Jun;14(3):146-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increase influences cell survival, reactive gliosis and inflammatory responses. Since prior work has focused primarily on peripheral nerve and brain, little is known about the role of LIF in the spinal cord injury response. We address this issue by examining the effects of injury in the LIF knockout (KO) mouse, as well as using an adenoviral vector to over-express LIF in the spinal cord of adult mice. We find that LIF over-expression results in a dramatic rise in cell proliferation, primarily in microglia/macrophages. Astrocytes are not stimulated to proliferate but are activated by the elevated LIF. LIF over-expression also causes the development of severe hindlimb motor dysfunction, an effect mediated by the enhanced activation of microglia/macrophages, as inhibiting microglial activation with minocycline attenuates these motor deficits. Conversely, proliferation is significantly diminished and the microglial/macrophage response to spinal cord injury is much less in the LIF KO compared to wild type (WT). Thus, LIF is a potent pro-inflammatory factor in the adult spinal cord and represents a potential target for the manipulation of inflammatory reactions after spinal cord injury.","['Kerr, Bradley J', 'Patterson, Paul H']","['Kerr BJ', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125, USA. bkerr@its.caltech.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hindlimb/physiopathology', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Minocycline/pharmacology', 'Motor Activity/genetics/immunology', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2004/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.expneurol.2004.04.012 [doi]', 'S0014488604001414 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2004 Aug;188(2):391-407. doi: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2004.04.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study we used Friend virus (FV) as a model to analyze whether a DC vaccine is capable of inducing protective immunity against retroviral infections. Mice were vaccinated twice with spleen-derived DC loaded with FV antigen. All control mice that received DC without antigen developed progressive leukemia after FV challenge. In contrast, five of the 14 vaccines were protected against infection, three recovered from FV-induced disease, and only six progressed to lethal leukemia. Animals that progressed to disease had high viral loads in blood and spleen similar to the control mice. Virus-specific antibody responses were not induced by DC vaccination. In contrast, protection correlated with a vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cell response directed against an immunodominant epitope of FV. CD8+ T-cells were critical for the protective effect of the DC vaccine, since in vivo depletion of these cells from immunized mice prevented their protection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The capacity of par-4 to interfere with factor independence induced by p185(BCR-ABL) and V12ras was evaluated by analysis of factor-independent growth of p185(BCR-ABL)/ par-4 and V12ras/par-4 transduced cells. The expression of par-4 and p185(BCR-ABL) by the respective constructs was controlled by Western blot analysis. Activated Ras was detected by pull-down assay in the cell clones expressing p185(BCR-ABL) in the absence and presence of par-4. RESULTS: Expression of p185(BCR-ABL) causes factor independence, signifying a conversion toward a transformed phenotype in hematopoietic precursors. We demonstrate that par-4 completely abolishes factor independence induced by p185(BCR-ABL) and partially abrogates factor independence caused by activated V12ras. Evaluating the underlying molecular mechanisms, we show that par-4 hinders activation of oncogenic Ras and causes concomitant disruptions of p185(BCR-ABL)-mediated signaling. CONCLUSION: We provide the first evidence that par-4 exhibits an antitransforming capacity by antagonizing p185(BCR-ABL)-induced factor-independent proliferation in hematopoietic cells.","['Kukoc-Zivojnov, Natasa', 'Puccetti, Elena', 'Chow, Kai U', 'Bergmann, Marion', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris S', 'Weidmann, Eckhart', 'Boehrer, Simone']","['Kukoc-Zivojnov N', 'Puccetti E', 'Chow KU', 'Bergmann M', 'Ruthardt M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E', 'Boehrer S']","['Department of Medicine III, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prostate', 'Rats', 'Transfection']",,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/09/08 05:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.04.004 [doi]', 'S0301472X04001031 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jul;32(7):649-56. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.04.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such compounds are validated as being capable of binding to specific protein domains and able to exert a remarkable range of biological effects. In an effort to identify synthetic 2-pyrones with interesting biological effects, herein we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-substituted-6-methyl-2-pyrones. Synthetic routes to 4-alkyl/alkenyl/aryl/alkynyl-6-methyl-2-pyrones have been developed utilising Sonogashira, Suzuki and Negishi cross-coupling starting from readily available 4-bromo-6-methyl-2-pyrone. Specific conditions for each organometallic protocol were required for successful cross-coupling. In particular, a triethylamine/acetonitrile--base/solvent mixture was crucial to Sonogashira alkynylation of 4-bromo-6-methyl-2-pyrone, whereas thallium carbonate was a mandatory base for the Suzuki cross-coupling of trialkylboranes. The 2-pyrones demonstrate potent inhibitory activity against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Botrytis cinerea. The growth inhibitory activities of selected 2-pyrones were determined in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma and K562 human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell lines using an in vitro cell culture system (MTT assay). These studies demonstrate that 4-phenylethynyl-, 4-tetrahydropyranylpropargyl ether- and 4-ethynyl-6-methyl-2-pyrones have excellent potential as a new class of anticancer agents.","['Fairlamb, Ian J S', 'Marrison, Lester R', 'Dickinson, Julia M', 'Lu, Feng-Ju', 'Schmidt, Jan Peter']","['Fairlamb IJ', 'Marrison LR', 'Dickinson JM', 'Lu FJ', 'Schmidt JP']","['Department of Chemistry, University of York, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, UK. ijsf@york.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrones)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Bacteria/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Pyrones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2004/07/13 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bmc.2004.01.051 [doi]', 'S0968089604004122 [pii]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2004 Aug 1;12(15):4285-99. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2004.01.051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. REVIEW METHODS: Selected studies and full-text articles were screened and rigorously selected. Survival was the key outcome measure. Surrogate outcome measures included haematological (blood) response and cytogenetic (bone marrow) response (CR). As no published cost-effectiveness studies were found that compared imatinib and IFN-alpha, an independent Markov model was constructed and this was compared with models submitted to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence by the manufacturer of imatinib. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that imatinib was associated with complete CR at 12 months follow-up of 68% compared with 20% for the IFN-alpha plus Ara-C group. The estimated proportion of people taking imatinib who had not progressed to accelerated or blast phases at 12 months was 98.5%, and 93.1% for IFN-alpha plus Ara-C. Overall survival was not statistically significantly different. Withdrawal due to side-effects was 2% for imatinib and 5.6% for IFN-alpha plus Ara-C. Cross-over due to intolerance was 0.7% and 22.8% for imatinib and for IFN-alpha plus Ara-C, respectively. Quality of life was better in the imatinib group than the IFN-alpha group when assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months. Median survival across the four IFN-alpha versus hydroxyurea studies was 66 and 56.2 months, respectively. Median complete CR was 6% for IFN-alpha and 0 for hydroxyurea. Median withdrawal due to side-effects was 24% and 4% for IFN-alpha and hydroxyurea, respectively. Four out of the five studies comparing BMT and IFN-alpha showed a long-term survival advantage for BMT over IFN-alpha, but a short-term disadvantage. In four of the five studies comparing BMT and IFN-alpha, median survival had not yet been reached in the BMT groups in 6--10 years. Median survival in the IFN-alpha arms ranged from 5.2 to 7 years. The BMT group gained a survival advantage over IFN-alpha at 3--5.5 years. In the BMT group death due to transplant-related complications ranged from 36 to 45%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of imatinib compared with IFN-alpha from the independent model was GBP26,180 per quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) gained and was relatively robust. Imatinib was less cost-effective than hydroxyurea with an ICER of GBP86,934. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib appears to be more effective than current standard drug treatments in terms of cytogenetic response and progression-free survival, with fewer side-effects. However, there is uncertainty concerning longer term outcomes, the development of resistance to imatinib, the duration of response and the place of imatinib relative to BMT. New issues are continually arising, such as optimal management pathways and combination therapies. Recommendations for research include: long-term follow-up data from the first- and second-line imatinib trials; investigation into specific subgroups, e.g. high-risk patients, the elderly, children or those eligible for BMT; long-term comparisons of imatinib with BMT performed in early stages of CML; the use of imatinib in combination with other therapies, and further detailed economic studies. Investigation of the impact of CML and imatinib on quality of life is also important.","['Dalziel, K', 'Round, A', 'Stein, K', 'Garside, R', 'Price, A']","['Dalziel K', 'Round A', 'Stein K', 'Garside R', 'Price A']","['Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, University of Exeter, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",108,2004/07/13 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/07/13 05:00'],"['2004/07/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['20-18-01 [pii]', '10.3310/hta8280 [doi]']",ppublish,"Health Technol Assess. 2004 Jul;8(28):iii, 1-120. doi: 10.3310/hta8280.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since a high level of HTLV-1 provirus load in circulating lymphocytes is thought to be a risk for ATL and HAM/TSP, diminution of HTLV-1 provirus load in the circulation may prevent these intractable diseases. Our previous study (Jpn J Cancer Res 2000; 91: 34-40) demonstrated that green tea polyphenols inhibit in vitro growth of ATL cells, as well as HTLV-1-infected T-cells. The present study aimed to investigate the in vivo effect of green tea polyphenols on HTLV-1 provirus load in peripheral blood lymphocytes on HTLV-1 carriers. We recruited 83 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers to examine HTLV-1 provirus DNA with or without administration of capsulated green tea extract powder. Thirty-seven subjects were followed up for 5 months by measuring HTLV-1 provirus load after daily intake of 9 capsules of green tea extract powder per day (equivalent to 10 cups of regular green tea), and 46 subjects lived ad libitum without intake of any green tea capsule. The real-time PCR quantification of HTLV-1 DNA revealed a wide range of variation of HTLV-1 provirus load among asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (0.2-200.2 copies of HTLV-1 provirus load per 1000 peripheral blood lymphocytes). Daily intake of the capsulated green tea for 5 months significantly diminished the HTLV-1 provirus load as compared with the controls (P = 0.031).

The second patient is a 60-yr-old male, who presented with acute thoracic aortitis after a 2-yr history of refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Both patients received immunosuppressive treatment with steroids, leading to rapid improvement of systemic inflammatory symptoms, vessel wall injury and peripheral blood counts. Whereas the first patient displayed sustained favorable hematologic responses under long-term steroid therapy, there was a rapid transformation into secondary acute myeloid leukemia in the second patient.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all children and adolescents up to 18 years presenting with FN in a single pediatric oncology unit between 1993 and 2001. MAIN RESULTS: In 132 patients, 364 episodes of FN were reported. The relative incidence of FN increased significantly over time in patients with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PBC-ALL), reflecting the increased intensity of chemotherapy. At presentation with FN, the proportions of patients (1) with PBC-ALL versus other malignancies, (2) with other malignancies being in complete remission, (3) with a central venous catheter, and (4) with shaking chills all significantly increased over time (overall proportions, 64%, 60%, 50%, and 5%, respectively; p <0.001 for all). In 337 (93%) episodes, ceftriaxone plus amikacin was used as empirical broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that some characteristics of FN, though not necessarily its management, change over time, implying regular update of risk prediction rules. In contrast to other centers, the first-line antimicrobial therapy did not need modification because of changing resistance patterns.","['Ammann, Roland A', 'Aebi, Christoph', 'Hirt, Andreas', 'Ridolfi Luthy, Annette']","['Ammann RA', 'Aebi C', 'Hirt A', 'Ridolfi Luthy A']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. roland.ammann@insel.ch""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",,2004/07/10 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/07/10 05:00'],"['2004/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-004-0660-z [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2004 Dec;12(12):826-32. doi: 10.1007/s00520-004-0660-z.

At multiplicity of infection = 100 over 90% of human leukemic K562 and Jurkat cells were transduced with HVS/EGFP-TK. Conditions of no selective pressure expression were maintained at > 92% per cell division. Expression of the EGFP-TK fusion protein rendered transfected leukaemic cells sensitive to cytotoxic treatment with the prodrugs ganciclovir (GCV) and (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'deoxyuridine (BVDU) at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. The viral vector was also screened against a panel of colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. All cell lines were transduced but showed a range of sensitivity to infection. Three of the most easily transduced cell lines: Mia PaCa, HCT116 and SW948 transduced with HVS/EGFP-TK were effectively ablated by subsequent treatment with GCV or BVDU. Our results show that in its current form HVS/EGFP-TK could be utilized as an antitumour agent, or it could be developed further by inclusion of a therapeutic gene, with TK presence ensuring a mechanism of controlled removal of modified cells when no longer necessary. These results suggest that HVS/EGFP-TK has a great potential for a number of gene therapy applications.","['Hoggarth, Jennifer H', 'Jones, Elena', 'Ensser, Armin', 'Meredith, David M']","['Hoggarth JH', 'Jones E', 'Ensser A', 'Meredith DM']","[""Molecular Medicine Unit, University of Leeds, St James' University Hospital, Leeds, UK. medjhh@leeds.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '2M3055079H (brivudine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Aotidae', 'Base Sequence', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transfection']",,2004/07/10 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/07/10 05:00'],"['2004/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700729 [doi]', '7700729 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2004 Sep;11(9):613-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700729.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review summarizes recent findings related to the molecular basis of GC-induced apoptosis and GC resistance, and discusses their potential clinical implications. Accumulating evidence suggests that GC may induce cell death via different pathways resulting in apoptotic or necrotic morphologies, depending on the availability/responsiveness of the apoptotic machinery. The former might result from regulation of typical apoptosis genes such as members of the Bcl-2 family, the latter from detrimental GC effects on essential cellular functions possibly perpetuated by GC receptor (GR) autoinduction. Although other possibilities exist, GC resistance might frequently result from defective GR expression, perhaps the most efficient means to target multiple antileukemic GC effects.

Therefore we are all exposed to a complex set of electric and magnetic fields of weak intensity. The levels of exposure of the general population range from 5 to 50 V/m for electric fields and from 0.01 to 0.2 micro T for magnetic fields. Fields in cause are essentially those associated to the use of the electric current (extremely low frequency, ELF: 50 Hz in France, 60 Hz in the United States) and those related to the use of cell phones (radio frequency: 900 and 1,800 MHz). The question of the possible risk on health by exposure to electric and/or magnetic fields became a concern to scientists and is now an important public debate. A number of expertises, led in particular by the WHO, leaning on the careful inspection of scientific publications from numerous countries, conclude that current data do not allow to assert the existence of sanitary effects; however our knowledge of the biologic effects of electromagnetic fields still contains certain gaps which should be filled. Indeed, the numerous epidemiological studies relative to the occurrence of cancer by exposure to electromagnetic fields are conflicting. In every case the increase of the risk, when described, is always weak. The measure of the Relative Risk (RR) which establishes the relation is approximately 2-3. At present, some data concerning the risk of childhood leukemia in the event of exposure of ELF generated in the home indicate that this risk can exist when children are chronically exposed to more than 0.4 micro T (the relative risk is in the order of 2). In the field of radio frequencies, the increasing use of cell phones (38 million users in France) and their antennae - basis are another subject of concern for the effects on health they are susceptible to produce. Large-scale studies, implying numerous countries, carried on at present within the framework of the WHO should bring elements of answer to the unresolved questions.","['Touitou, Y']",['Touitou Y'],"['Service de Biochimie medicale et biologie moleculaire, Faculte de Medecine Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris. touitou@ccr.jussieu.fr']",['fre'],['Lecture'],France,Ann Pharm Fr,Annales pharmaceutiques francaises,2985176R,,IM,"['Cell Phone', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology']",,2004/07/10 05:00,2004/09/08 05:00,['2004/07/10 05:00'],"['2004/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['MDOI-APF-07-2004-62-4-0003-4509-101019-ART1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-4509(04)94306-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharm Fr. 2004 Jul;62(4):219-32. doi: 10.1016/s0003-4509(04)94306-4.,Evaluation des effets des champs electromagnetiques sur la sante chez l'homme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these assays, we show that MLN518 has mild toxicity toward normal hematopoiesis at concentrations that are effective in treating FLT3 ITD-positive leukemia in mice. We also demonstrate that MLN518 preferentially inhibits the growth of blast colonies from FLT3 ITD-positive compared with ITD-negative patients with AML, at concentrations that do not significantly affect colony formation by normal human progenitor cells. In analogy to imatinib mesylate in BCR-ABL-positive acute leukemia, MLN518-induced remissions may not be durable. Our studies provide the basis for integrating this compound into chemotherapy and transplantation protocols.","['Griswold, Ian J', 'Shen, Lei J', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Demehri, Shadmehr', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Braziel, Rita M', 'McGreevey, Laura', 'Haley, Andrea D', 'Giese, Neill', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Deininger, Michael W N']","['Griswold IJ', 'Shen LJ', 'La Rosee P', 'Demehri S', 'Heinrich MC', 'Braziel RM', 'McGreevey L', 'Haley AD', 'Giese N', 'Druker BJ', 'Deininger MW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Portland 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*drug effects', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/07/10 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/10 05:00'],"['2004/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-05-1669 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)55964-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Nov 1;104(9):2912-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1669.

W51 expression resulted in a strong proliferative advantage and enhanced erythropoiesis as determined by immunophenotyping, colony assays, and molecular analyses. In MS-5 stromal cocultures, numerous early cobblestone areas (CAs) were generated within 10 to 14 days. Such W51-associated early CAs disappeared by 4 weeks, yet retained self-renewal properties as demonstrated by generation of secondary and tertiary CAs upon replating. This phenotype appears related to the expression of W51 since it was abolished by exposure to the FLT3 inhibitor, AG1295, but not to the c-kit inhibitor PD16. Wild-type Flt3-overexpressing CD34+ cells exposed to high levels of its physiologic ligand did not produce early CAs, highlighting differences in intracellular signaling between wild-type Flt3 and W51. W51-associated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) activation plays a major role in this phenotype, although additional downstream targets of W51 may be relevant. Flt3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts from patients invariably generated early AG1295-sensitive CAs in MS-5 cocultures, further validating the phenotype observed in transduced CD34+ cells.","['Chung, Ki Young', 'Morrone, Giovanni', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Wong, Bryan', 'Dorn, David C', 'Moore, Malcolm A S']","['Chung KY', 'Morrone G', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Wong B', 'Dorn DC', 'Moore MA']","['Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (6,7-dimethoxy-2-phenylquinoxaline)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/07/10 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/07/10 05:00'],"['2004/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4445 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)48390-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 1;105(1):77-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4445.

C9i enhancement of apoptosis was dose dependent and did not occur with irreversible inhibitors of caspases-2, -3, -6, and -8. C9i also enhanced apoptosis in cord blood-derived CD19(+) B-lineage cells (but not myeloid cells) removed from murine stromal cells. Longer exposure (> 18 hours) to C9i culminated in apoptosis in a panel of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines in the presence or absence of fibroblast monolayers, as well as in 2 proliferating leukemic cell lines (RAMOS and CEM).

ALL cells from 28 cases (85%) were expanded in this system, and growth was superior in SC than in long-term bone marrow culture. To characterize ALL progenitors, cells were sorted for expression of CD34 and CD10 or CD19 and the subfractions assayed in SC and in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Cells capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and NOD/SCID repopulation were derived only from the CD34(+)/CD10(-) and CD34(+)/CD19(-) subfractions, and these cells could engraft secondary recipients. The engrafted cells had the same immunophenotype and karyotype as was seen at diagnosis, suggesting they had differentiated in vivo. These results demonstrate that ALL cells capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and in vivo are CD34(+)/CD10(-)/CD19(-).

It is a water soluble, non-toxic fluorescent protein pigment with potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. In the present study the effect of highly purified C-PC was tested on growth and multiplication of human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562). The results indicate significant decrease (49%) in the proliferation of K562 cells treated with 50 microM C-PC up to 48 h. Further studies involving fluorescence and electron microscope revealed characteristic apoptotic features like cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA of cells treated with C-PC showed fragmentation pattern typical for apoptotic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of cells treated with 25 and 50 microM C-PC for 48 h showed 14.11 and 20.93% cells in sub-G0/G1 phase, respectively. C-PC treatment of K562 cells also resulted in release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. These studies also showed down regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 but without any changes in pro-apoptotic Bax and thereby tilting the Bcl-2/Bax ratio towards apoptosis. These effects of C-PC appear to be mediated through entry of C-PC into the cytosol by an unknown mechanism. The present study thus demonstrates that C-PC induces apoptosis in K562 cells by cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol, PARP cleavage and down regulation of Bcl-2.","['Subhashini, Jagu', 'Mahipal, Suraneni V K', 'Reddy, Madhava C', 'Mallikarjuna Reddy, Metukuri', 'Rachamallu, Aparna', 'Reddanna, Pallu']","['Subhashini J', 'Mahipal SV', 'Reddy MC', 'Mallikarjuna Reddy M', 'Rachamallu A', 'Reddanna P']","['Department of Animal Sciences, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500046, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '11016-15-2 (Phycocyanin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Phycocyanin/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2004/07/10 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/07/10 05:00'],"['2003/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.02.025 [doi]', 'S0006295204001261 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Aug 1;68(3):453-62. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.02.025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequestration of DNA molecules in these structures depended on active viral DNA replication, and was observed exclusively in cells that contained prominent viral replication domains. Furthermore, a significant portion of the accumulated DNA was found to be single-stranded, indicating that the sequestered DNA had been subjected to processing by nuclease or DNA unwinding activities. siRNA-mediated suppression of the PML protein prevented the recruitment of single-stranded DNA into nuclear foci, but did not significantly affect the overall efficiency of viral DNA replication.

At high cell density and high EDR concentration the opposite effect of an increase in cell death was observed.

To identify promoter systems that could increase the strength and persistence of transgene expression in primary human CD8(+) T cells, we designed a panel of Moloney retroviral vectors to express a destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (d4EGFP) reporter protein (t(1/2) = 4 hr). We found that the promoters phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), beta-actin, and long terminal repeat (LTR) produced the highest levels of d4EGFP expression in proliferating T cells, but that expression dramatically declined in quiescent cells with all promoters. To improve gene expression, we examined the effect of the beta-interferon (IFN) scaffold attachment region (SAR).

However, when the SAR was combined with the LTR promoter, it significantly enhanced expression in resting and cycling cells.

Resolution of fibrosis with therapy may improve patient outcome. METHODS: The effect of imatinib therapy on bone marrow fibrosis was evaluated in 40 patients with chronic-phase CML who were treated after interferon-alpha failure. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (78%) had severe (Grade 3 or 4) reticulin fibrosis prior to therapy. After imatinib therapy was administered for 3 to > 24 months, fibrosis was reduced by at least 2 grades in 19 of the 31 patients (61%) and by at least 1 grade in 34 patients (85%). There was no correlation noted between reduction of fibrosis and cytogenetic response. However, a reduction in fibrosis was found to correlate with a reduction in bone marrow megakaryocytosis (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with imatinib mesylate appears to reduce CML-associated bone marrow fibrosis in most patients who are treated during the chronic phase of disease. This effect may be independent of the degree of suppression of Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells, and may improve prognosis in patients with CML.","['Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Rios MB', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

The authors conducted a retrospective study comparing the outcomes among these elderly patients with the outcomes among younger patients to assess the impact of intensive treatment approaches in this age group. METHODS: One hundred ten consecutive patients age > or = 75 years with newly diagnosed AML (excluding patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia) were treated in the authors' center over 10 years. Initial treatment was comprised of anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy (i.e., intravenous idarubicin or daunorubicin for 3 days plus cytarabine [ARAC] for 7 days [3 + 7 regimen] or oral idarubicin) for 62 patients (56%), antimetabolite-based chemotherapy (including low-dose ARAC, oral 6-mercaptopurine plus methotrexate, or hydroxyurea) for 40 patients (36%), and supportive care only for 8 patients (7%). Results were compared with the results from 200 patients ages 65-74 years who were treated during the same period. RESULTS: A complete response (CR) to anthracycline-based induction therapy was achieved by 23 of 62 patients (37%), and the 2-year overall survival rate was 22% (which was not statistically different from the group of patients ages 65-74 years). In a multivariate analysis of the entire study group (310 patients), treatment (anthracycline-based vs. other) and age as continuous variable were found to affect survival significantly. In a Landmark analysis, the achievement of a CR translated into improved survival in patients age > or = 75 years.

New therapies are now emerging after the identification of molecular targets that result in improvement of hematologic parameters and may hold promise for the prevention of disease progression. METHODS: A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from MEDLINE (PubMed) and abstracts based on published meeting material. RESULTS: MDS is a heterogeneous group of disorders. Although current classification and prognostic schemes have proven valid to define subgroups, they are insufficient to take into consideration the significant biologic diversity of MDS. New molecular targets are identified as the mosaic of pathophysiologic pathways in MDS is being unraveled. Novel and targeted therapeutic agents, such as the inhibition of farnesyl transferases and receptor tyrosine kinases, more potent thalidomide analogs, and arsenic trioxide, have shown encouraging results and may offer durable benefit to patients with MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Although progress has been made in the understanding of clinical manifestations and some of the molecular pathways underlying ineffective hematopoiesis and leukemic transformation in MDS, intensive clinical and laboratory research continues to 1) identify further relevant pathophysiologic pathways, 2) better define MDS subgroups, and 3) develop new drugs based on a clearer understanding of disease biology.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",132,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20381 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Jul 15;101(2):226-41. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20381.,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant adenovirus has been reported to be a poorly efficient vector in leukemic cells. We investigated leukemic cell culture as a possible method of improving the efficacy of this vector. METHODS: Leukemic cell lines and primary cultured AML cells were incubated with adenoviral vectors carrying GFP, LacZ, or IL-12 cDNA. Transduction efficiency was evaluated by measuring adenoviral genome copy number and transgene expression in leukemic cells. The expression of the coxsackie/adenovirus receptor (CAR), CD29, CD49e, and CD51/61 was measured, as was the effect of blocking integrin on adenoviral transduction. RESULTS: Increasing the multiplicity of infection (MOI) to 300 plaque-forming units per cell enhanced transduction of leukemic cell lines and to a lesser degree of AML cells. Analysis of adenoviral genome copy per cell showed only a partial correlation between gene transfer efficiency and transgene expression. Culture of AML cells for 3 days prior to adenoviral transduction increased both adenoviral copy number per cell and the percentage of transgene-expressing cells. CD29, CD49e, and CD51/61 but not CAR expression increased in cultured AML cells between days 0 and 3 and integrin-blocking experiments showed inhibition of transduction in two of four AML samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient ex vivo gene transfer in primary cultured AML cells can be achieved by short-term culture of leukemic cells prior to gene transfer with adenoviral vectors at a high MOI. This effect appears to be at least partially mediated by enhanced integrin expression.","['Vereecque, Rodolphe', 'Saudemont, Aurore', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Vereecque R', 'Saudemont A', 'Quesnel B']","['Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, IFR-114, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2005/02/24 09:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.568 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2004 Jul;6(7):751-9. doi: 10.1002/jgm.568.,,"['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, findings on post-translational BCL2 phosphorylation in different systems have been difficult to integrate. Another antiapoptotic family member, MCL1, exhibits a difference in electrophoretic mobility upon phosphorylation induced by an activator of PKC (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; TPA) versus agents that act on microtubules or protein phosphatases 1/2A. A multiple pathway model is now presented, which demonstrates that MCL1 can undergo distinct phosphorylation events - mediated through separate signaling processes and involving different target sites - in cells that remain viable in the presence of TPA versus cells destined to die upon exposure to taxol or okadaic acid. Specifically, TPA induces phosphorylation at a conserved extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) site in the PEST region (Thr 163) and slows turnover of the normally rapidly degraded MCL1 protein; however, okadaic acid and taxol induce ERK-independent MCL1 phosphorylation at additional discrete sites. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of the complex regulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members by demonstrating that, in addition to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, MCL1 is subject to multiple, separate, post-translational phosphorylation events, produced in living versus dying cells at ERK-inducible versus ERK-independent sites.","['Domina, Aaron M', 'Vrana, Julie A', 'Gregory, Mark A', 'Hann, Stephen R', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['Domina AM', 'Vrana JA', 'Gregory MA', 'Hann SR', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Threonine/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207692 [doi]', '1207692 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Jul 8;23(31):5301-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207692.,,,,,"['R01 CA057359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that in both acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer cells the retinoic acid (RA) and interferon signaling pathways converge on the promoter of the tumoricidal death ligand TRAIL. Promoter mapping, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA interference reveal that retinoid-induced interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a tumor suppressor, is critically required for TRAIL induction by both RA and IFNgamma. Exposure of breast cancer cells to both antitumor agents results in enhanced TRAIL promoter occupancy by IRF-1 and coactivator recruitment, leading to strong histone acetylation and synergistic induction of TRAIL expression. In coculture experiments, pre-exposure of breast cancer cells to RA and IFNgamma induced a dramatic TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in heterologous cancer cells in a paracrine mode of action, while normal cells were not affected. Our results identify a novel TRAIL-mediated tumor suppressor activity of IRF-1 and suggest a mechanistic basis for the synergistic antitumor activities of certain retinoids and interferons. These data argue for combination therapies that activate the TRAIL pathway to eradicate tumor cells.","['Clarke, Nicole', 'Jimenez-Lara, Ana M', 'Voltz, Emilie', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich']","['Clarke N', 'Jimenez-Lara AM', 'Voltz E', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Department of Cell Biology and Signal Transduction, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire/CNRS/INSERM/ULP, Illkirch, CU de Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.emboj.7600302 [doi]', '7600302 [pii]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2004 Aug 4;23(15):3051-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600302.

In all, 19 CML patients were conditioned with 2 Gy total-body irradiation in combination with (n=14) or without (n=3) fludarabine 3 x 30 mg/m(2) (Flu) or 4.5 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) with Flu and OKT3 3 x 5 mg (n=2) and were treated with cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil after allogeneic HCT. BCR-ABL transcripts were analyzed by nested RT-PCR and Taqman((R)) RT-PCR on days +28, +56 and +84 after HCT and were evaluated for their association with relapse. Of the 19 patients, 14 achieved sustained remissions of which six had a negative RT-PCR 28 days after HCT. Five patients relapsed +41, +54, +57, +136 and +234 days after HCT. Predictors for relapse were advanced disease stage (P=0.02) and slow reduction of BCR-ABL transcripts at day 28 (P=0.006) and day 56 (P=0.047) post-transplant. We conclude that a complete clearance of BCR-ABL transcripts is achievable within 4 weeks from HCT even after minimal conditioning and that early kinetics of BCR-ABL transcripts significantly correlate with the probability of hematological relapse.","['Lange, T', 'Deininger, M', 'Brand, R', 'Hegenbart, U', 'Al-Ali, H', 'Krahl, R', 'Poenisch, W', 'Uharek, L', 'Leiblein, S', 'Gentilini, C', 'Petersdorf, E', 'Storb, R F', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Lange T', 'Deininger M', 'Brand R', 'Hegenbart U', 'Al-Ali H', 'Krahl R', 'Poenisch W', 'Uharek L', 'Leiblein S', 'Gentilini C', 'Petersdorf E', 'Storb RF', 'Niederwieser D']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Leipzig, Germany. langet@medizin.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic System/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403425 [doi]', '2403425 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Sep;18(9):1468-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous mastocytosis is a benign disease in which MC infiltration is confined to the skin. In pediatric cases cutaneous mastocytosis might regress spontaneously. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is more frequently diagnosed in adults and is a persistent (clonal) disease of bone marrow-derived myelomastocytic progenitors. The somatic c-kit mutation D816V is found in the majority of such patients. The natural clinical course in SM is variable. Whereas most patients remain at the indolent stage for many years, some have aggressive SM (ASM) at diagnosis. Other patients have an associated clonal hematologic non-MC lineage disease (AHNMD). MC leukemia (MCL) is a rare disease variant characterized by circulating MCs and fatal disease progression. The diagnoses of ASM, SM-AHNMD, and MCL might be confused with a variety of endocrinologic, vascular, or immunologic disorders. It is therefore of particular importance to be aware of the possibility of an underlying (malignant) MC disease in patients with unexplained vascular instability, unexplained (anaphylactoid) shock, idiopathic flushing, diarrhea, headache, and other symptoms that might be mediator related. An important diagnostic clue in such cases is an increased serum tryptase level. The current review provides an overview of mastocytosis and its subvariants and a practical guide that might help to delineate mastocytosis from unrelated systemic disorders.","['Valent, Peter', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Schwartz, Lawrence B', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Valent P', 'Sperr WR', 'Schwartz LB', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@akh-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/diagnosis', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Mastocytosis/classification/*diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/blood', 'Tryptases']",102,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jaci.2004.02.045 [doi]', 'S0091674904010772 [pii]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004 Jul;114(1):3-11; quiz 12. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2004.02.045.,,"['Copyright 2004 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of PPARgamma signals in leukemia is still unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2), that is a ligand for PPARgamma, on proliferation of human leukemia cell line U937. 15dPGJ2 at 5 micromol/l stimulated the proliferation. In contrast, 15dPGJ2 at concentrations of >10 micromol/l inhibited the proliferation through the induction of apoptosis. PGD2, PGJ2 and Delta12-PGJ2 (DeltaPGJ2), those are precursors of 15dPGJ2, had similarly proliferative effects, whereas they showed antiproliferative effects at high concentrations. FACScan analysis revealed that PGD2 at 5 micromol/l, PGJ2 at 1 micromol/l, DeltaPGJ2 at 1 micromol/l and 15dPGJ2 at 5 micromol/l, all accelerated cell cycle progression. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that PGD2 at 5 micromol/l and 15dPGJ2 at 5 micromol/l inhibited the expression of phospho-p38, phospho-MKK3/MKK6 and phospho-ATF-2, and the expression of Cdk inhibitors including p18, p27. In contrast, PGJ2 at 1 micromol/l and DeltaPGJ2 at 1 micromol/l did not affect the expression of them.

Chicken CD30L consists of 1,152 base pairs (bp) with an open reading frame (ORF) of 720 bp having 36.4% identity with human CD30L, whereas chicken TRAIL is 1,134 bp long with an ORF of 912 bp having 54.4% identity with human TRAIL. Chicken CD30L was expressed at high levels in the spleen, bursa of Fabricius and in the chicken monocytic leukemia cell line, IN24. Stimulation with LPS in the spleen, bursa of Fabricius and the IN24 cell line did not affect CD30L expression. The gene expression of chicken TRAIL was essentially to the same level in all tissues examined.

We envisage that secretory granules can act as vehicles for targeting inflammatory sites, including malignancies, and thereafter, locally release therapeutically active agents to these sites. Exogenous proteins, such as the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1), have been shown previously to be targeted to secretory lysosomes [1]. In this work, we asked whether exogenous, secretory lysosome-targeted proteins were subject to regulated secretion. sTNFR1-transmembrane (tm)-cytosol-sorting signal (Y) and sTNFR1-tm-Y-enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) were expressed in rat basophilic leukemia cell clones having different secretory capacities. sTNFR1-tm-Y was targeted directly from the Golgi to secretory lysosomes, followed by generation of membrane-free sTNFR1, whose secretion could be triggered by a Ca2+ ionophore or immunoglobulin E receptor activation. In contrast, sTNFR1-tm-Y-egfp was targeted to the plasma membrane and then subjected to endocytosis and presumably, secretory lysosome targeting, as judged by results from antibody ligation and cell-surface biotinylation. Activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester promoted ectodomain shedding at the cell surface, resulting in sTNFR1 release from sTNFR1-tm-Y-egfp. These results support a concept for using the storage organelles of hematopoietic cells as vehicles for targeting sites of inflammation with therapeutically active agents.","['Gao, Ying', 'Hansson, Markus', 'Calafat, Jero', 'Tapper, Hans', 'Olsson, Inge']","['Gao Y', 'Hansson M', 'Calafat J', 'Tapper H', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Hematology, C14, BMC, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biotinylation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Exocytosis/*physiology', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Sorting Signals', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.1103593 [doi]', 'jlb.1103593 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Oct;76(4):876-85. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1103593.

Sequence analysis was performed for all of the coding exons 1-15 of PTPN11, revealing a novel 3-bp deletion mutation and 10 recurrent missense mutations in 18 patients. Clinical assessment showed that 1) the growth pattern was similar in mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients, with no significant difference in birth length [-0.6 +/- 2.2 sd (n = 10) vs. -0.6 +/- 1.4 sd (n = 21); P = 0.95], childhood height [-2.6 +/- 1.1 sd (n = 14) vs. -2.1 +/- 1.6 sd (n = 23); P = 0.28], or target height [-0.4 +/- 0.9 sd (n = 14) vs. -0.2 +/- 0.7 sd (n = 17); P = 0.52]; 2) pulmonary valve stenosis was more frequent in mutation-positive patients than in mutation-negative patients (10 of 18 vs. 6 of 27; P = 0.02), as was atrial septal defect (10 of 18 vs. 4 of 27; P = 0.005), whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present in five mutation-negative patients only; and 3) other features were grossly similar in the prevalence between mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients, but hematological abnormalities, such as bleeding diathesis and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, were exclusively present in mutation-positive patients (5 of 18 vs. 0 of 27; P = 0.007). The results suggest that PTPN11 mutations account for approximately 40% of Noonan syndrome patients, as has been reported previously.

Pharmacological inhibition of PI3'-kinase using LY294002 resulted in apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines including CEM, Jurkat, and MOLT-4. On the other hand, the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell line HUT-78 was found to be refractory to LY294002- inducible apoptosis. Sensitivity or resistance to pharmacological inhibitors of PI3'-kinase correlated with tumor suppressor PTEN gene expression, as sensitive T-ALL cells do not express PTEN and have high level of activated AKT, in contrast to HUT-78 cells. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of PI3'-kinase results in dephosphorylation of AKT and partial inhibition of Bcl-xL expression in T-ALL cells, but not in HUT-78 cells. Interestingly, HUT-78 cells were also found to express higher levels of Bcl-xL protein as compared to T-ALL cells. Inhibition of PI3'-kinase also induces release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspase-3 and PARP in all T-ALL cell lines tested, but not in HUT-78 cells. Taken altogether, our data demonstrate that the PI3'-kinase/AKT pathway plays a major role in the growth and survival of PTEN-null T-ALL cells, and identify this cascade as promising target for therapeutic intervention in acute T-cell leukemias.","['Uddin, Shahab', 'Hussain, Azhar', 'Al-Hussein, Khaled', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Bhatia, Kishor G']","['Uddin S', 'Hussain A', 'Al-Hussein K', 'Platanias LC', 'Bhatia KG']","[""King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer and Research, MBC# 98-16, P.O.

In mouse fibroblast cell lines MLg, NIH 3T3 and primary mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF), murine OSM (muOSM) stimulated high TIMP-1 mRNA expression in comparison to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin (IL)-1beta and transforming growth factor (TGF)beta. In cell signaling, muOSM induced strong phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase (Erk) 1/2, p38 and Akt in addition to phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT3 and STAT5 within 15 min. LIF and TGFbeta had no such effects. EGF stimulated comparable or lower Erk1/2, p38 and Akt phosphorylation while IL-1beta induced p38 phosphorylation in the fibroblast cell lines. The Erk1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 inhibited TIMP-1 mRNA response to muOSM, whereas the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 enhanced the TIMP-1 mRNA response in NIH 3T3 and MLg cells. PD98059 and SB203580, but not LY294002, also inhibited fold induction of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene driven by a minimal TIMP-1 promoter that contained a proximal activator protein-1 (AP-1) site. Co-transfection with JunB or c-Jun expression vector in NIH 3T3 cells caused marked transactivation of the TIMP-1 promoter/CAT reporter gene. muOSM caused a rapid increase of JunB and c-Jun protein in NIH 3T3 cells. PD98059 partially inhibited the increase of JunB, but not c-Jun, whereas SB203580 did not induce detectable changes in expression of either AP-1 factor in response to muOSM. These results demonstrate that Erk1/2 and p38 contribute to the elevation of muOSM induced TIMP-1 expression, but PI3K does not, and suggest that Erk1/2 does so by enhancing JunB expression.","['Tong, Li', 'Smyth, David', 'Kerr, Christine', 'Catterall, Jonathon', 'Richards, Carl D']","['Tong L', 'Smyth D', 'Kerr C', 'Catterall J', 'Richards CD']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, HSC-4H17, 1200 Main Stree West, Hamilton, ON, Canada L8S 3Z5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, jun/physiology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2005/01/20 09:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.03.003 [doi]', 'S0898656804000348 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2004 Oct;16(10):1123-32. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.03.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleus contains inositol phosphates, actin and actin-binding proteins and myosin isoforms, multiple protein kinases and phosphatases targeting Cdk-1 and Cdk-2, MAPK/SAPK, and Src-related kinases and their substrates, suggesting the implication of several signalling pathways in the intranuclear organization and function of nuclear bodies (NBs). NBs include the well-characterized Cajal bodies (CBs; or coiled bodies), the nucleolus, perinucleolar and perichromatin regions, additional NBs best illustrated by the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies [PML-NBs, also named PML oncogenic dots (PODs), ND10, Kr-bodies] and similar intranuclear foci containing multi-molecular complexes with major role in DNA replication, surveillance, and repair, as well as messenger RNA and ribosomal RNA synthesis and assembly. Chromatin modifying proteins, such as the CBP acetyltransferase and type I histone deacetylase, accumulate at PML-NBs. PML-NBs and Cajal bodies are very dynamic and mobile within the nuclear space and are regulated by cellular stress (heat shock, apoptosis, senescence, heavy metal exposure, viral infection, and DNA damage responses). NBs strongly interact, using signalling mechanisms for the directional and ordered traffic of essential molecular components. NBs organize the delivery and storage of essential RNAs and proteins that play a role in transcription, pre-mRNA biosynthesis and splicing, and the sequestration and/or degradation of regulatory proteins, such as heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs), p53, Rb1, CBP, STAT3, and others. The objective of this review is to summarize some aspects of these nuclear structures/bodies/domains, including their proposed roles in cellular signalling and in human diseases, mainly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.","['Zimber, Amazia', 'Nguyen, Quang-De', 'Gespach, Christian']","['Zimber A', 'Nguyen QD', 'Gespach C']","['Department of Animal Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Compartmentation/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Coiled Bodies/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",200,2004/07/09 05:00,2005/01/20 09:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.03.020 [doi]', 'S0898656804000580 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2004 Oct;16(10):1085-104. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.03.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two patients who underwent allogeneic sibling HSCT and developed severe cGVHD involving the small bowel, causing unremitting obstructive symptoms and malnutrition despite maximal immunosuppression. Both patients underwent ileal resection and stricturoplasties. The first patient promptly improved, and remains asymptomatic 32 months after transplant. Three weeks after the resection of 90 cm of small bowel, the second patient developed leaking stricturoplasty and peritonitis, with a relapse of chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase. Later, an enterocutaneous fistula required additional small bowel resection and ileostomy. The patient subsequently died from pulmonary infection a few weeks after the last surgical procedure. Similar to inflammatory bowel disease, these two cases highlight that surgery may be a valuable option in patients who present with obstructive severe cGVHD refractory to aggressive immunosuppression.","['Herr, Andree-Laure', 'Latulippe, Jean-Francois', 'Carignan, Stephane', 'Mitchell, Andrew', 'Belanger, Robert', 'Roy, Jean']","['Herr AL', 'Latulippe JF', 'Carignan S', 'Mitchell A', 'Belanger R', 'Roy J']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Ileal Diseases/*etiology/pathology/*surgery', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology', 'Lung Diseases/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Peritonitis/etiology', 'Postoperative Complications']",6,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.tp.0000127251.16608.8f [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2004 May 27;77(10):1617-20. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000127251.16608.8f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 4-year-old girl with diagnosis of acute lymphoid leukemia developed febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy. Broad spectrum antibiotics and antimycotic therapy were initiated. Candida albicans was isolated and Entamoeba histolytica was observed in stool examination. Chronic disseminated candidiasis had developed and was treated with amphotericin B, initially, and fluconazol. Computed tomography images were obtained that demonstrated a classic 'bull's eye' pattern; a concurrent histological study confirmed the diagnosis. Candida spp. is the major cause of opportunistic mycosis in immunosuppresed patients receiving chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies. An initial infection results in disseminated candidiasis, which persists and becomes chronic. In the 4-year-old patient, the identified risk factors consisted of a previous therapy with broad spectrum antibiotics, the gastrointestinal tract colonization with Candida albicans and prolonged neutropenia. Imaging diagnoses are made by ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance. With ultrasound and tomography, 4 distinct patterns have been described. Pattern 1 ('wheels within wheels') and 2 ('bull's eye') are important, since they are characteristic of chronic disseminated candidiasis. The third pattern (hypoechoic image) is the most common finding with both techniques.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a subclass of idiopathic eosinophilia that requires the documentation of both sustained eosinophilia (> or = 1500/microL for at least 6 months) and target-organ damage. A series of novel observations in the last 5 years have warranted a refined approach to the diagnosis as well as the treatment of clonal eosinophilic disorders, including systemic mastocytosis.

An inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase, imatinib mesylate, is rapidly becoming the first-line therapy for CML. However, the development of resistance to this drug is a frequent setback, particularly in patients in advanced phases of the disease. Several mechanisms of resistance have been described, the most frequent of which are amplification and/or mutations of the BCR-ABL gene. To overcome resistance, several approaches have been studied in vitro and in vivo. They include dose escalation of imatinib, combination of imatinib with chemotherapeutic drugs, alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitors, inhibitors of kinases downstream of Bcr-Abl, farnesyl and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase, proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, arsenic trioxide, hypomethylating agents, troxacitabine, targeting Bcr-Abl messenger RNA, and immunomodulatory strategies. It is important to understand that these approaches differ in efficiency, which is often dependent on the mechanisms of resistance.

SET-CAN encodes an almost complete SET protein fused to the C-terminal two-thirds of CAN. SET is also known as TAF-Ibeta, a histone chaperone and intracellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, whereas CAN is identical to Nup214, a nucleoporin protein. To obtain insight into the leukemogenic function of SET/TAF-Ibeta-CAN/Nup214, we have examined its subcellular localization. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that SET/TAF-Ibeta and CAN/Nup214 are found in the nucleus and the nuclear envelope, respectively, whereas the majority of SET/TAF-Ibeta-CAN/Nup214 is localized in the nucleus. SET/TAF-Ibeta-CAN/Nup214 interacted with hCRM1, one of the nuclear export factors, and caused aberrant intracellular localization of hCRM1. In cells expressing SET/TAF-Ibeta-CAN/Nup214, a protein containing a nuclear export signal accumulated in the nucleus. The export of this protein was partially restored by overexpression of hCRM1. These results suggest that aberrantly localized molecules associated with SET/TAF-Ibeta-CAN/Nup214 may be involved in oncogenesis.","['Saito, Shoko', 'Miyaji-Yamaguchi, Mary', 'Nagata, Kyosuke']","['Saito S', 'Miyaji-Yamaguchi M', 'Nagata K']","['Department of Infection Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SET-CAN fusion protein, human)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/08/28 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20296 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Sep 10;111(4):501-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20296.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a human --> mouse chimeric model, we demonstrate that allogeneic anti-third-party cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) depleted of alloreactivity are endowed with a potent anti-B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) reactivity. Likewise, CTL preparations generated from autologous T cells of the same patients with B-CLL exhibited comparable leukemia eradication, suggesting that the reactivity of allogeneic anti-third-party CTLs is not mediated by residual antihost clones. This specificity was also exhibited in vitro, and annexin staining revealed that B-CLL killing is mediated by apoptosis. While the CTLs killing of third-party cells could be blocked by anti-CD3 antibody, the lysis of the B-CLL cells was not inhibited by this antibody, suggesting a T-cell receptor (TCR)-independent cytotoxicity. The role of cell contact leading to apoptosis of B-CLL cells is shown in transwell plates and by anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-blocking antibody. Up-regulation of CD54 and the subsequent apoptosis of B-CLL cells depend on the initial LFA-1/ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) interaction.

Procedures entailed identifying tasks and jobs involving exposure, identifying factors influencing historical changes in exposure potential, and using mathematical models to calculate job- and time-period-specific exposures. Exposure metrics included 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) intensity, the annual number of peak exposures (BD: >100 ppm, STY: >50 ppm) and TWA intensity below and above the peak threshold. The 5th and 95th percentiles of the approximate probability distribution of each exposure estimate served as its 90% uncertainty interval. Job- and year-specific estimates were linked with subjects' work histories to obtain cumulative exposure indices. Exposure estimates varied among tasks, jobs, plants, and time periods. BD TWAs were approximately 10 ppm during the 1940s-1960s and declined during the 1970s and 1980s. STY TWAs were always <2 ppm. DMDTC exposure began in the 1950s, was high through the 1960s, and later declined. BD peak exposure accounted for a large proportion of cumulative BD exposure, whereas almost none of the STY exposure was experienced at levels >50 ppm. Exposure indices were correlated. Exposures were higher than previously estimated. Multiple correlations among DMDTC, BD, and STY exposure estimates make it difficult to estimate agent-specific effects. Limitations of the methodology include the potential inaccuracy of the estimates, the lack of adequate industrial hygiene data to validate the estimates, the additional inaccuracy of linkage with poorly specified job groups, and the potential for differential exposure misclassification because the jobs and work areas where excess leukemia mortality occurred were well-known at the time of this study. Nevertheless, the new exposure estimates were highly correlated with the old, yielding equivalent exposure ranking of workers and were comparable to limited industrial hygiene data published by NIOSH.","['Macaluso, Maurizio', 'Larson, Rodney', 'Lynch, Jeremiah', 'Lipton, Sydney', 'Delzell, Elizabeth']","['Macaluso M', 'Larson R', 'Lynch J', 'Lipton S', 'Delzell E']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA. mmacaluso@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Occup Environ Hyg,Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,101189458,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Dimethyldithiocarbamate)', '0 (Mutagens)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Butadienes/*analysis', 'Chemical Industry/*history', 'Dimethyldithiocarbamate/*analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Job Description', 'Leukemia/*etiology', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Mutagens/*analysis', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.', 'Occupational Exposure/*history', 'Reference Values', '*Rubber', 'Styrene/*analysis', 'United States']",,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/15459620490452004 [doi]', '8MP4C2JDUB2A71ND [pii]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Hyg. 2004 Jun;1(6):371-90. doi: 10.1080/15459620490452004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to explore the effect of tissue destruction on the induction of anti-P autoantibodies, we searched for anti-P autoantibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 201 antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive individuals, in 10 patients with treated kidney SLE and in 45 acute leukaemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. The autoantibody reactivity was further characterized using one- and two-dimensional immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence. Anti-P were detected in 5.5% (11/201) of ANA-positive individuals, but not in kidney-affected SLE patients or in patients with leukaemia. Seven of 11 anti-P-positive patients had SLE (3/11), primary Sjogrens's syndrome (1/11) and other autoimmune diseases (3/11). A relation between disease activity and anti-P was suggested by follow-up examinations in one SLE patient, supported by the absence of anti-P autoantibodies in the 10 treated kidney SLE patients. Anti-P autoantibodies were detected by immunoblot in one patient with SLE indicating anti-P2 predominance and in the patient with Sjogrens's syndrome indicating anti-P1 predominance. Diverging humoral responses in these ANA- and anti-P-positive patients were further illustrated by immunofluorescence, elucidating varying nuclear reactivity and anti-P pattern. The observation of anti-P in individuals with active autoimmune disease, but not in patients with chemotherapy-induced cell damage, suggests that anti-P antibodies are part of a specific disease process, and not elicited as a response to cell destruction per se.","['Ersvaer, E', 'Bertelsen, L-T', 'Espenes, L C', 'Bredholt, T', 'Boe, S O', 'Iversen, B M', 'Bruserud, O', 'Ulvestad, E', 'Gjertsen, B T']","['Ersvaer E', 'Bertelsen LT', 'Espenes LC', 'Bredholt T', 'Boe SO', 'Iversen BM', 'Bruserud O', 'Ulvestad E', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Institute of Medicine and Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (L12E protein, Trypanosoma cruzi)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Protozoan Proteins', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*immunology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/immunology/pathology""]",,2004/07/09 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/07/09 05:00'],"['2004/07/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.0300-9475.2004.01450.x [doi]', 'SJI1450 [pii]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2004 Jul-Aug;60(1-2):189-98. doi: 10.1111/j.0300-9475.2004.01450.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After achievement of complete remission by CAG therapy, he was treated on an outpatient basis. In July, his AML relapsed and he was treated mainly by transfusion therapy. In September, hematemesis recurred resulting in hemostasis with the same procedure. In the course of endoscopic injections, his mucosal lesion became difficult to observe.

To elucidate how TERT is inactivated during differentiation, we applied all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to induce the differentiation of human teratocarcinoma (HT) cells and human acute myeloid leukemia (HL60) cells. We first showed that TERT promoter activity decreased rapidly, which preceded a gradual loss of endogenous telomerase activity following ATRA induction. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the reduced TERT promoter activity during differentiation, we performed epigenetic studies on the TERT promoter and found a progressive histone hypoacetylation coupled with a gradual accumulation of methylated cytosines in the TERT promoter. We also observed that the TERT promoter was less methylated in pluripotent HT cells than in multipotent HL60 cells throughout a 12-day differentiation process. This origin-dependent epigenetic change was also confirmed in histone acetylation studies, indicating that the TERT promoter was more resistant to deacetylation in HT cells than in HL60 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate synergistic involvement of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in the down-regulation of TERT promoter activity that may be dependent on the origin of the cell types, and they add new insight into the way telomerase activity may be regulated during differentiation.","['Liu, Liang', 'Saldanha, Sabita N', 'Pate, Mitchell S', 'Andrews, Lucy G', 'Tollefsbol, Trygve O']","['Liu L', 'Saldanha SN', 'Pate MS', 'Andrews LG', 'Tollefsbol TO']","['Department of Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Telomerase/*genetics/physiology']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20058 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Sep;41(1):26-37. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20058.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['1 R03 AG20375 01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the levels of CSF IGF-1 and IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) in children with ALL to find out whether these levels correlated with any of the neurological deficits observed. METHODS: IGF-1 and IGFBP-2 levels were prospectively measured by radioimmunoassay in the CSF of 14 children with ALL throughout the ALL chemotherapy. These were compared with the levels of 16 control subjects and of patient groups with severe neurological diseases. RESULTS: During induction, the children with ALL had subnormal CSF IGF-1 levels which improved after 2 months. In seven individuals, two with severe vincristine polyneuropathy, the subnormal levels persisted throughout the chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest impairment of the IGF-1 trophic system during induction by a mechanism so far unknown.

It has been prescribed to be given daily without therapeutic monitoring of drug levels. After first-pass metabolism by hepatic xanthine oxidase (XO), mercaptopurine is converted into two major intracellular metabolites, thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) and methylated mercaptopurine metabolites (including methylated thioinosine nucleotides), which are cytotoxic in vitro. Its short plasma half-life and S-phase-dependent pharmacokinetics suggest that biologically active concentration and exposure duration may be critical to cell kill. METHODS: Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 9605, a randomized, open label phase III study of standard-risk ALL, was designed to compare daily with twice-daily mercaptopurine during continuation therapy. Red blood cell (RBC) TGN and methylated mercaptopurine metabolite levels were measured as surrogates of leukemic cell levels in a randomly selected subset of patients. TGN and methylated mercaptopurine metabolites were analyzed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and reported in ng/8 x 10.8 RBC. Statistical inferences utilized multiple linear regression. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients received mercaptopurine 75 mg/m(2) daily and 108 received 37.5 mg/m(2)/dose twice daily. Descriptive statistics for the daily group showed the median TGN was 42 ng (mean and standard deviation [SD] = 48 +/- 35, quartiles 29-64). For the twice daily group, it was 40 ng (mean and SD = 40 +/- 27, quartiles 26-53). For methylated mercaptopurine metabolites, the daily group median was 2,020 ng (mean and SD = 2,278 +/- 1,559, quartiles 1,247-3,162); the twice daily group median was 1,275 ng (mean and SD = 1,580 +/- 1,240, quartiles 599-2,369). When adjusted for the covariables: actual dosage, days on study, age at diagnosis, white blood cell count, gender, Black race compared with not, and Hispanic compared with not, daily dosing resulted in significantly higher average methylated mercaptopurine metabolites by 668 (standard error [SE] = 179, P = 0.001) and a trend toward higher average TGNs by 6.2 (SE = 4.2, P = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Daily dosing of mercaptopurine resulted in higher mean red cell methylated mercaptopurine metabolites when compared to split (twice a day dosing). The data were inconclusive with respect to TGNs. The relationships of methylated mercaptopurine metabolites and TGNs to clinical outcomes will be elucidated as part of the maturing 9605 data.","['Bell, B A', 'Brockway, G N', 'Shuster, J J', 'Erdmann, G', 'Sterikoff, S', 'Bostrom, B', 'Camitta, B M']","['Bell BA', 'Brockway GN', 'Shuster JJ', 'Erdmann G', 'Sterikoff S', 'Bostrom B', 'Camitta BM']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Georgia Children's Medical Center, Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Clinician, Augusta 30912-3730, USA. bbell@mail.mcg.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20089 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Aug;43(2):105-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20089.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,"[""Pediatric Oncology Group study (now The Children's Oncology Group)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and acquired resistance to the drug can occur in both diseases. Molecular mechanisms have been reported in CML and GIST for primary resistance, whereas extensive studies on the mechanisms responsible for secondary resistance have been almost exclusively reported for CML. METHODS: In a patient with advanced GIST undergoing imatinib therapy, an isolated progressing peritoneal mass was excised, along with 2 still-responding lesions. Complementary DNA and genomic DNA were analyzed by sequencing for c-Kit gene mutations. KIT receptor expression and phosphorylation status were assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Transient-transfection experiments were performed with mutagenized KIT constructs, and their activation status was assessed. RESULTS: In addition to an exon 11 mutation, shared among all of the analyzed lesions, a novel point mutation in c-Kit exon 14 resulting in T670I substitution was found only in the progressing lesion, which harbored a phosphorylated receptor, as opposed to the finding of an inactive receptor in responding lesions. Functional analyses showed that KIT/T670I is insensitive to imatinib and that T670I mutation, introduced in a receptor responding to imatinib, subverted its sensitivity to the drug. CONCLUSIONS: This new mutation was confined to the progressing lesion; the resulting amino acidic substitution, T670I, affecting the ATP/imatinib pocket of KIT, makes it insensitive to the drug. Interestingly, this substitution is a homologue to the T315I mutation already reported in CML, where it is responsible for acquired resistance to imatinib.","['Tamborini, Elena', 'Bonadiman, Lorena', 'Greco, Angela', 'Albertini, Veronica', 'Negri, Tiziana', 'Gronchi, Alessandro', 'Bertulli, Rossella', 'Colecchia, Maurizio', 'Casali, Paolo G', 'Pierotti, Marco A', 'Pilotti, Silvana']","['Tamborini E', 'Bonadiman L', 'Greco A', 'Albertini V', 'Negri T', 'Gronchi A', 'Bertulli R', 'Colecchia M', 'Casali PG', 'Pierotti MA', 'Pilotti S']","['Department of Pathology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e al Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/secondary/surgery', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative/methods']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0016508504002203 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2004.02.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2004 Jul;127(1):294-9. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2004.02.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL/AML1-positive ALL has a favorable prognosis, and one possible reason is that this subtype of ALL rarely shows drug resistance. AML1/ETO, another AML1-containing chimeric protein, has been shown to transcriptionally repress the activity of the multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) gene promoter; thus, we examined whether TEL/AML1 also represses MDR-1 gene expression, possibly preventing the emergence of multidrug resistance. In this study, we show that the TEL/AML1 protein binds to the consensus AML1 binding site in the MDR-1 promoter and transcriptionally represses its activity. Following transient transfection of TEL/AML1 protein into Adriamycin-resistant K562/Adr cells, we also demonstrate that TEL/AML1 can down-regulate the expression of P-glycoprotein, a product of the MDR-1 gene, and restore the chemosensitivity to the cells. Furthermore, we report that MDR-1 mRNA levels in leukemic cells obtained from TEL/AML1-positive ALL patients are lower than those from TEL/AML1-negative ALL patients. Thus, TEL/AML1 protein acts as a transcriptional repressor of MDR-1 gene expression, and although TEL/AML1 has been implicated in leukemogenesis, its effects on the MDR-1 gene may contribute to the excellent prognosis of TEL/AML1-positive ALL with current therapy.","['Asakura, Keiko', 'Uchida, Hideo', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Kobayashi, Hiroyuki', 'Miyakawa, Yoshitaka', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Takahashi, Hiroyuki', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Asakura K', 'Uchida H', 'Miyachi H', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Nimer SD', 'Takahashi H', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transfection']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['2/6/339 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2004 Jun;2(6):339-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure (24 h) of U937 human leukemia cells to NaB (1 mM) or SAHA (1.5 microM) resulted in a marked increase in NF-kappaB DNA binding, effects that were essentially abrogated by coadministration of flavopiridol (100 nM). These events were accompanied by a marked increase in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Mutant cells expressing an IkappaBalpha super-repressor exhibited impairment of NF-kappaB DNA binding in response to HDACIs and a significant although modest increase in apoptosis. However, disruption of the NF-kappaB pathway also increased mitochondrial injury and caspase activation in response to flavopiridol and to an even greater extent to the combination of flavopiridol and HDACIs. Coadministration of flavopiridol with HDACIs down-regulated the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), Mcl-1, and p21CIP1/WAF1 and activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; moreover, these effects were considerably more pronounced in IkappaBalpha mutants. Similar responses were observed in U937 mutant cells stably expressing RelA/p65 small interfering RNA. In all cases, flavopiridol was significantly more potent than genetic interruption of the NF-kappaB cascade in promoting HDACI-mediated lethality. Together, these findings are consistent with the notion that although inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by flavopiridol contributes to antileukemic interactions with HDACIs, other NF-kappaB-independent flavopiridol actions (e.g., down-regulation of Mcl-1, XIAP, and p21CIP1/WAF1) play particularly critical roles in this phenomenon.","['Gao, Ning', 'Dai, Yun', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Gao N', 'Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'I-kappa B Proteins', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'U937 Cells', 'Vorinostat', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.104.002014 [doi]', 'mol.104.002014 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Oct;66(4):956-63. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.002014.

Silver, M.D. and co-chaired by Jerry L. Spivak, M.D. It was held from 16 to 18 October 2003 in New York City, New York, USA. Thirty-nine invited speakers from nine different countries participated in the conference. There were more than 350 attendees. There were formal presentations and discussions on biology, clinical aspects, and management of patients with these diverse bone marrow stem cell disorders linked by a variable progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Of considerable interest, a clinical symposium exclusively for patients was held the day preceding the meeting at which John Bennett, Tiziano Barbui, Richard Silver, Jerry Spivak, and Ayalew Tefferi spoke on various topics pertaining to these diseases. This proved to be highly informative to the patients who reported that they enjoyed the program immensely. This was sponsored by the Cancer Research & Treatment Fund, Inc. Representatives of the Myelodysplasia Foundation were also present. This meeting report provides a summary of five different sections prepared by one or more of the session chairs. The keynote address was given by Shahin Rafii (Cornell Medical Center). Most appropriately, this talk focused on the expression and activation of angiogenic factors which play a crucial role in the progression of both myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Among the known factors, vascular endothelial growth tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGF-R1, R2, and R3) support proliferation, survival, and mobility. Rafii's team has demonstrated that these receptors are expressed on subsets of primary hematopoietic cells as well as leukemic cells. Some leukemic cells express both VEGF-A and VEGF-R2, resulting in the generation of an autocrine loop that supports survival and within the osteoblastic zone translocating these cells to the vascular enriched niche for receipt of molecular instructions required for proliferation and differentiation. A pathologic correlation can be seen in some patients with the identification of abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) in the central portions of the medullary cavity. Misplaced megakaryocytes can release pro-fibrotic factors, including platelet derived growth factors and transforming growth factor-beta. Collectively, these data suggest that chronic disregulation of angiogenic factors alter the microenvironment dislocating marrow stem cells that force both proliferation and differentiation in varying degrees, contributing to these hematological disorders.","['Silver, R T', 'Bennett, J M', 'Deininger, M', 'Feldman, E', 'Rafii, S', 'Silverstein, R L', 'Solberg, L A', 'Spivak, J L']","['Silver RT', 'Bennett JM', 'Deininger M', 'Feldman E', 'Rafii S', 'Silverstein RL', 'Solberg LA', 'Spivak JL']","['Weill-Cornell Medical Center, 1300 York Ave-Box 34, New York, NY 10021 4896, USA.']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/etiology/genetics', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/genetics', 'Polycythemia', 'Primary Myelofibrosis', 'Thrombocytosis']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/09/15 05:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.012 [doi]', 'S0145212604000438 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Sep;28(9):979-85. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in the presence of 1 microM ATRA, approximately 50% of UF-1 cells expressing annexin V, an early-apoptotic marker, was negative for CD11b and showed immature morphology. These findings suggest that UF-1 cells, despite expressing mutant PML-RARalpha protein, can be induced by ATRA to undergo differentiation and apoptosis through RA-inducible mechanism(s), in which a proportion of apoptosis may occur independent of terminal differentiation. This unique cell line may be useful for investigating the pathogenesis of ATRA resistance and the mechanism of ATRA-induced apoptosis in APL.","['Sato, Atsushi', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Hoshi, Yoshiyuki', 'Rikiishi, Takeshi', 'Fujii, Kunihiro', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Kagechika, Hiroyuki', 'Kakizuka, Akira', 'Hayashi, Yutaka', 'Iinuma, Kazuie']","['Sato A', 'Imaizumi M', 'Hoshi Y', 'Rikiishi T', 'Fujii K', 'Kizaki M', 'Kagechika H', 'Kakizuka A', 'Hayashi Y', 'Iinuma K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/09/15 05:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2003/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.12.017 [doi]', 'S0145212604000207 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Sep;28(9):959-67. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.12.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isolated peripheral lymphocytes were administered concentrations of IFP ranging from 0.1 ng/ml to 10 microg/ml. The absence (Group 1) and presence (Group 2) of DNA repair inhibitors 4 mM hydroxyurea (HU), 40 microM cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and an NADPH regenerating system (NRS) (Group 3) were analyzed at 1, 6 and 24 h by single cell gel electrophoresis using the comet assay. Significant damage to DNA directly from IFP at 1 h by remarkably low concentrations was observed in Group 1, escalating in Group 2 with DNA repair inhibition, while Group 3 disruptions were highest due to the presence of the NRS P-450 microsomal fraction conducive to producing reactive IFP-oxon and N-desalkyl metabolites. The extent of DNA aberrations increased further in parallel within the groups at 6 and 24 h. Male and female chemical sensitivities were similar on average (P < 0.01). Cholinesterase activity measured in a satellite group was inhibited with 0.1 microg/ml IFP by 69, 62, and 48% at 1, 6, and 24 h, respectively, indicating gradual induction of compensatory synthesis. Restoration of cholinergic homeostasis may be exceptionally impaired at higher IFP concentrations from acetyl-CoA depletion [Leuk. Res. 25 (2001) 883]. In summary, these studies reveal that exposure to the organophosphate pesticide isofenphos induces human DNA mutation beyond endogenous repair capacity and disrupts cholinergic nuclear signaling affectively constructing the mutator phenotype of leukemogenesis.","['Williams, Robert D', 'Boros, Laszlo G', 'Kolanko, Christopher J', 'Jackman, Shawna M', 'Eggers, Thomas R']","['Williams RD', 'Boros LG', 'Kolanko CJ', 'Jackman SM', 'Eggers TR']","['CFE Toxicology, LLC, P.O.

OBJECTIVE: To review the treatment of Brazilian children who were diagnosed with MDS or JMML in the past decade and reported to the Brazilian Cooperative Group on Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes (BCG-MDS-PED). RESULTS: Of 173 children reported to the BCG-MDS-PED from January 1997 to January 2003 with a suspected diagnosis of MDS or JMML, 91 had the diagnosis confirmed after central review of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information on previous treatments was available for 78 MDS/JMML patients. Treatment varied from different schedules of low-dose (14%) and standard-dose chemotherapy (50%), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF 7%), interferon (5%), steroids (2%) and erythropoietin (2%) to allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) (14%). No survival advantage could be demonstrated based on Hasle's classification or based on treatment. CONCLUSION: This report reflects the current practice in treating Brazilian children with MDS/JMML without specific Cooperative Group guidelines. Treatment modalities were very heterogeneous. The strategies for implementing a national protocol should consider international guidelines and focus on local experience and available resources.","['Valera, Elvis Terci', 'Latorre, Maria do Rosario Dias', 'Mendes, Wellington Luiz', 'Seber, Adriana', 'Lee, Maria Lucia Martino', 'de Paula, Mario Jose Aguiar', 'Loggetto, Sandra Regina', 'Velloso, Elvira', 'Niero-Melo, Ligia', 'Lopes, Luiz Fernando']","['Valera ET', 'Latorre Mdo R', 'Mendes WL', 'Seber A', 'Lee ML', 'de Paula MJ', 'Loggetto SR', 'Velloso E', 'Niero-Melo L', 'Lopes LF']","['Departamento de Puericultura e Pediatria, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Av.

Thioredoxin (Trx) is a key redox-regulating protein and oxidative stress sensor operating in synergy with Trx-reductase and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The expression of Trx, PDI, and the Trx-regulated transcription-factor Pax5 were analyzed in a panel of human B cell lines and were compared with that of the Bcl-2 family proteins, also redox-controlled. The panel included representative cells from various stages: FLEB14-4 (pro-B); REH and NALM-6 (pre-B); Rael and Daudi (small mature B); U-698 and NC0467.3 (B-blasts); LP-1, U-1996, and U-266 (plasma cells). We found a significant congruence and co-variation of Trx and Bcl-2 levels in the B-lineage, with high expression levels in early stages (pro-B and pre-B) and in the late stage representing terminally-differentiated plasma cells, whereas mid-stage small resting B cells showed a very low expression. PDI increased significantly in plasma-blasts and plasma cells, indicating its importance in the highly specialized immunoglobulin assembly-machinery, including disulfide-bond isomerization.

In P19 EC cells that do not express GAP-43, neurogenesis is inhibited; many immature neurons apoptose and the survivors do not mature morphologically. Here we show that the initial defect is in an early precursor with characteristics of a neural stem cell, which failed to respond normally to retinoic acid (RA). As a consequence, its progeny had altered cell fates: In addition to the neuronal defects previously reported, RC1-labeled radial glia failed to exit the cell cycle, accumulated, and failed to acquire GFAP immunoreactivity. However, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) could stimulate GFAP expression suggesting that astrocytes not derived from radial glia are less affected by absence of GAP-43. Differentiation of radial glia-derived astrocytes was also inhibited in glial cultures from GAP-43 (-/-) cerebellum, and in GAP-43 (-/-) telencephalon in vivo, differentiation of astrocytes derived from both radial and nonradial glia lineages were both affected: In the glial wedge, GFAP-labeled radial glia-derived astrocytes were reduced consistent with the interpretation that they may be unable to deflect GAP-43 (-/-) commissural axons toward the midline. At the midline, both radial and nonradial glia-derived astrocytes were also decreased although it fused normally. The results demonstrate that GAP-43 expressed in multipotent precursors is required for appropriate cell fate commitment, and that its absence affects astrocyte as well as neuronal differentiation.","['Shen, Yiping', 'Mani, Shyamala', 'Meiri, Karina F']","['Shen Y', 'Mani S', 'Meiri KF']","['Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'GAP-43 Protein/*deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/physiology']",,2004/07/06 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2003/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.mcn.2004.03.004 [doi]', 'S1044743104000697 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2004 Jul;26(3):390-405. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2004.03.004.,,['Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.'],,,['NS33118/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, overall survival of patients remains poor. Scientific advances in recent years have enhanced our understanding of the biology of cancer. Human protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play a central role in human carcinogenesis and have emerged as the promising new targets. Several approaches to inhibit tyrosine kinase have been developed. These agents have shown impressive anticancer effects in preclinical studies and are emerging as promising agents in the clinic. The remarkable success of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia has particularly stimulated intense research in this field. At least 30 inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development in cancer, and about 120 clinical trials are ongoing worldwide. In this review, we focus on the role of tyrosine kinases in cancer and the development of specific small molecule inhibitors for therapy. We also provide a critical analysis of the current data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and highlight areas for future research. Issues with regards to the design of clinical trials with such agents are also discussed. Innovative approaches are needed to fully evaluate the potential of these agents, and a concerted international effort will hopefully help to integrate these inhibitors in cancer therapy in the near future.","['Madhusudan, Srinivasan', 'Ganesan, Trivadi S']","['Madhusudan S', 'Ganesan TS']","['Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, University Of Oxford, The Churchill, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, Oxford OX3 7LJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",177,2004/07/06 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/07/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2004.05.006 [doi]', 'S0009912004001298 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2004 Jul;37(7):618-35. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2004.05.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative Ad-based approaches such as tumor-specific, replication-competent vectors and/or exploiting therapeutic gene products with intrinsic toxic activity, such as gibbon ape leukemia virus fusogenic membrane glycoprotein, diphtheria toxin A (DTA), and ricin, would demand a very tightly regulated promoter to avoid breakthrough replication and toxicity in nontumor tissue and Ad producer cell lines. In this study we optimized the activity/specificity profile of the synthetic beta-catenin-dependent promoter by varying its basal promoter, the number of Tcf binding sites, and the distance between these and the basal promoter. The optimal promoter, CTP4, showed virtually undetectable expression in cells with normal beta-catenin regulation but high level expression in cells deregulated for beta-catenin. Using CTP4 we were able to generate, for the first time to our knowledge, an Ad vector expressing fully active wild-type DTA without the need for time-consuming and cumbersome production systems. CTP4 should be the promoter of choice for Ad-based gene therapies of tumors deregulated for beta-catenin.

Patients with T-cell NHL are often treated similarly to patients with intermediate grade B-cell NHL, although many reports have demonstrated lower overall survival rates in patients with T-cell NHL compared to patients with B-cell NHL. Updated classifications have recognized specific clinical and pathologic T-cell entities, such as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise characterized, angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, systemic anaplastic T-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma nasal type, and enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma. Furthermore, these distinct T-cell NHL subtypes often warrant individualized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, such as the associated cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis and hemophagocytic syndrome with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, the chromosomal translocation t(2;5), leading to the nucleophosmin anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion protein, viral pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 associated with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, respectively, and the role of radiation therapy in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type. Other active therapeutic agents in T-cell NHL include purine and pyrimidine antimetabolite agents (eg, nucleoside analogues and gemcitabine, respectively), denileukin diftitox, and antinucleoside or retinoic acid with interferon-alpha combination treatment. The exact role of transplantation in patients with T-cell NHL is unknown, but several case series have documented the feasibility of autologous and allogeneic transplant with reported long-term survival rates similar to transplanted B-cell NHL. Identification of relevant proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in the pathogenesis of T-cell NHL, such as the nucleophosmin anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion protein, p53 and retinoblastoma gene, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, histone deacetylation inhibitors, and infectious etiologies (eg, Epstein-Barr virus and Helicobacter pylori), in addition to their interplay with the various regulatory pathways of cell-cycle progression and apoptosis, represent potential candidates for molecular-based therapy.

Use of external group-level exposure information, available for all cases and controls (including nonparticipants), can reduce participation bias and improve precision of effect estimates. Our methodologic investigation was motivated by a population-based case-control study on occupational exposures and leukemia. We assessed exposure using dichotomous data collected in interviews, and also using census data on past and current occupational groups for all subjects. Based on information from a job-exposure database, a group-level probability of exposure was assigned to each subject. We studied the performance of the iterative expectation-maximization method for estimating the odds ratio (OR) by using the individual-level exposure data on the interviewed participants together with the assigned group-level exposure probabilities for the nonparticipants. In each iteration, the expected numbers of exposed and unexposed among the nonparticipating cases and controls were calculated from their assigned exposure probabilities and, for the cases only, from the current OR estimate. We then estimated the OR based on the total (observed plus expected) numbers and repeated the procedure until convergence. The expectation-maximization method eliminated participation bias and improved precision for scenarios with error-free group-level exposures and individual-level exposure data missing at random conditional on disease status and group affiliation. We specifically addressed consequences of assigning erroneous exposure probabilities to the nonparticipating subjects. In such situations, the expectation-maximization method can produce biased estimates if the participation rates among the cases and controls differ substantially.","['Stromberg, Ulf', 'Bjork, Jonas']","['Stromberg U', 'Bjork J']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University, Sweden. ulf.stromberg@ymed.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,,IM,"['*Bias', '*Case-Control Studies', 'Censuses', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', '*Probability', 'Refusal to Participate', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Self Disclosure', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['00001648-200407000-00017 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ede.0000129510.67536.36 [doi]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2004 Jul;15(4):494-503. doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000129510.67536.36.,,['Copyright 2004 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We describe 2 children with acute presentations of gas gangrene secondary to C. perfringens. Both children were initially seen and treated in a community hospital emergency department and subsequently were cared for in a pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care, university-based children's hospital. RESULTS: Both children demonstrated severe and unrelenting decompensation and required operative intervention within the first hospital day, which included amputation of the infected limb. One child survived and one child expired despite heroic measures. CONCLUSIONS: Gas gangrene secondary to C. perfringens is an uncommon but life-threatening and limb-threatening condition in pediatric cancer patients. A high index of suspicion in a immunocompromised child with cancer who presents with extremity pain in combination with neutropenia is the key to early diagnosis and may lead to improved survival. This disease requires prompt recognition and aggressive treatment to allow any hope of recovery. Emergency medicine physicians who treat these children should be aware of this severe and potentially fatal infectious process and should not delay treatment or prompt orthopedic surgery consultation.","['Temple, Ana-Maria M', 'Thomas, Neal J']","['Temple AM', 'Thomas NJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Penn State Children's Hospital, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Emerg Care,Pediatric emergency care,8507560,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amputation', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clostridium perfringens/*isolation & purification', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Edema/etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gas Gangrene/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leg/surgery', 'Male', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/immunology']",12,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['00006565-200407000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/01.pec.0000132218.42729.97 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Emerg Care. 2004 Jul;20(7):457-9. doi: 10.1097/01.pec.0000132218.42729.97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the details of two epidemiologically unrelated patients with bacteraemia featuring M-type 58 Streptococcus pyogenes, a seemingly rare cause of human infection in the UK, and briefly review previous reports of infection with non-haemolytic strains of this species. METHODS: Case notes of the two patients were reviewed. Isolates obtained from clinical specimens were recovered and identified and cultured on horse blood agar to observe pattern of haemolysis. RESULTS: In the first case, of a 75 year-old man with leukaemia and a retropharyngeal abscess, the isolate was consistently non-haemolytic, probably due to a failure to produce streptolysin S as has been described before in a small number of reports involving various M-types. In the second case, of an 84 year-old woman with dermatitis and septicaemia, the organism was principally beta-haemolytic but with no haemolysis on aerobic culture where the colonies were well spaced, a phenomenon thought to be associated with abundant production of serum opacity factor (OF). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: These cases are a reminder that misleading cultural appearances can occur with S. pyogenes and that OF positive strains can produce poor haemolysis on aerobic culture, or fail even to do so at all.","['Weightman, Nigel C', 'Barnham, Michael R D']","['Weightman NC', 'Barnham MR']","['Department of Microbiology, Friarage Hospital, Northallerton, UK. nigel.weightman@stees.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/*isolation & purification']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/10/14 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2004 May;119 Suppl:17-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another member of the ETO family, ETO-2/MTG16, is highly expressed in murine and human hematopoietic cells, bears >75% homology to ETO, and like ETO, contains a conserved MYND domain that interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR). AML1-ETO prevents granulocyte but not macrophage differentiation of murine 32Dcl3 granulocyte/macrophage progenitors. One possible mechanism is recruitment of N-CoR to aberrantly repress AML1 target genes. We wished to examine another mechanism by which AML1-ETO might impair granulocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that AML1-ETO decreases interactions between ETO-2 and N-CoR. Furthermore, overexpression of ETO-2 relieves AML1-ETO-induced granulocyte differentiation arrest. This suggests that decreased interactions between ETO-2 and N-CoR may contribute to granulocyte differentiation impairment. The MYND domain coimmunoprecipitates with N-CoR and inhibits interactions between ETO-2 and N-CoR, presumably by occupying the ETO-2 binding site on N-CoR. This inhibition of ETO-2 interactions with N-CoR is specific because the MYND domain does not inhibit retinoic acid receptor interactions with N-CoR. To examine the effect of decreasing interactions between ETO-2 and N-CoR in hematopoietic cells, without effects of AML1-ETO such as direct repression of AML1 target genes, the MYND domain was expressed in 32Dcl3 and human CD34+ cells. The MYND domain prevented granulocyte but not macrophage differentiation of both 32Dcl3 and human CD34+ cells, recapitulating this effect of AML1-ETO. In conclusion, decreasing interactions between ETO-2 and N-CoR, an effect of AML1-ETO, inhibits granulocyte differentiation.","['Ibanez, Vinzon', 'Sharma, Arun', 'Buonamici, Silvia', 'Verma, Amit', 'Kalakonda, Sudhakar', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Kadkol, ShriHari', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen']","['Ibanez V', 'Sharma A', 'Buonamici S', 'Verma A', 'Kalakonda S', 'Wang J', 'Kadkol S', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/08/27 05:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3689 [doi]', '64/13/4547 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jul 1;64(13):4547-54. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3689.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, there is a rapidly growing population of pediatric cancer survivors in which the long-term genotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic intervention is unknown. To study the genotoxic effects of antineoplastic treatment in children, we performed a comparative analysis of the changes in the frequency of somatic mutations (Mfs) at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)-reporter gene in children treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). We measured HPRT Mfs from 130 peripheral blood samples from 45 children with ALL (13, low risk; 22, standard risk; and 10, high risk) from the time of diagnosis, as well as during and after the completion of therapy. We observed a significant increase in mean HPRT Mfs during each phase of therapy (diagnosis, 1.4 x 10(-6); consolidation, 52.1 x 10(-6); maintenance, 93.2 x 10(-6); and off-therapy, 271.7 x 10(-6)) that were independent of the risk group treatment protocol used. This 200-fold increase in mean somatic Mf remained elevated years after the completion of therapy. We did not observe a significant difference in the genotoxicity of each risk group treatment modality despite differences in the compositional and clinical toxicity associated with these treatment protocols. These findings suggest that combination chemotherapy used to treat children with ALL is quite genotoxic, resulting in an increased somatic mutational load that may result in an elevated risk for the development of multi-factorial diseases, in particular second malignancies.","['Rice, Sederick C', 'Vacek, Pamela', 'Homans, Alan H', 'Messier, Terri', 'Rivers, Jami', 'Kendall, Heather', 'Finette, Barry A']","['Rice SC', 'Vacek P', 'Homans AH', 'Messier T', 'Rivers J', 'Kendall H', 'Finette BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/08/27 05:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3940 [doi]', '64/13/4464 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jul 1;64(13):4464-71. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3940.,,,,,"['1 P20RR16462/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1K01CA77737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA09094013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R29HD35309/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For lymphomas of mice expressing murine leukemia virus, mutagenic proviral insertions are thought to play a similar role. Here we report studies designed to determine whether specific retroviral integration sites might be associated with a specific subset of mouse B-cell lymphomas and if the genes associated with these sites are regularly altered in expression. We studied splenic marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) of NFS.V(+) mice that are unusual in exhibiting frequent progression from low to high grade, potentially allowing assignment of cancer genes to processes of initiation and progression. We used inverse PCR to clone and analyze 212 retroviral integration sites from 43 MZL at different stages of progression. Sixty-two marked common integration sites and included 31 that had been marked previously. Among the new common integration sites, seven were unique to MZL. Using microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR analysis, we defined differential patterns of gene expression in association with disease progression for Gfi1, Sox4, Brca2, Snf1lk, Nfkb1, Pou2af1, Prdm1, Stat6, and Blnk.

These results indicate that activation of Notch4 results in enhanced stem cell activity, reduced differentiation, and altered lymphoid development, suggesting it may influence both stem cells and the fate of the common lymphoid progenitor.","['Vercauteren, Suzanne M', 'Sutherland, Heather J']","['Vercauteren SM', 'Sutherland HJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 601 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH4 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/abnormalities/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/deficiency/genetics']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0204 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43289-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 15;104(8):2315-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0204.

Oral imatinib was administered daily at dose levels ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m(2). Plasma pharmacokinetic studies were performed on days 1 and 8 of course 1. There were 31 children who received 479 courses of imatinib. The most common toxicities encountered, which occurred in less than 5% of courses, were grade 1 or 2 nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, and reversible increases in serum transaminases. One patient at the 440-mg/m(2) dose level had dose-limiting weight gain. There were no other first-course dose-limiting toxicities. A maximum tolerated dosage was not defined. Among 12 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients evaluable for cytogenetic response, 10 had a complete response and 1 had a partial response. Among 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients evaluable for morphologic response, 7 achieved an M1 and 1 achieved an M2 bone marrow. We observed marked interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters. In conclusion, we found that daily oral imatinib is well tolerated in children at doses ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m(2).

As(2)O(3), at therapeutic concentrations (1-2 microM), induced apoptosis in Raji lymphoma cells but not in Jurkat lymphoma cells, which inversely correlated with the levels of glutathione-S-transferase pi (GSTP1), but not GSTpi(1) and GSTM(1), expression and activity. GSTP1 mRNA, protein level, and activity were high in Jurkat cells but undetectable in Raji cells. Stable transfection of GSTP1 into Raji cells decreased the amount of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by therapeutic concentrations of As(2)O(3) in Raji cells is related to increasing H(2)O(2) intracellular accumulation but not to JNK activation. Forced expression of GSTP1 by transfection of Raji cells significantly decreased the basal amount of H(2)O(2) and its levels after therapeutic concentration of As(2)O(3) treatment. Added exogenous H(2)O(2) was removed more rapidly, which correlated with a greater decrease in reduced glutathione level in Raji clones expressing GSTP1 than in those clones without GSTP1 expression. Overexpression of GSTP1 in transfected Raji clones was also found to decrease the retention of As(2)O(3). These data suggest that GSTP1 blocks As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells by decreasing intracellular amounts of H(2)O(2) by catabolism and H(2)O(2) production by decreasing the intracellular retention of As(2)O(3).","['Zhou, Li', 'Jing, Yongkui', 'Styblo, Miroslav', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Zhou L', 'Jing Y', 'Styblo M', 'Chen Z', 'Waxman S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Box 1178, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

Microarray technology has been applied extensively for this purpose, even though it has been reported that the agreement between microarray platforms is poor. A critical question is: how can we best combine the measurements of matched genes across microarray platforms to develop diagnostic and prognostic tools related to the underlying biology? RESULTS: We introduce a statistical approach within a Bayesian framework to combine the microarray data on matched genes from three investigations of gene expression profiling of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and normal B cells (NBC) using three different microarray platforms, oligonucleotide arrays, cDNA arrays printed on glass slides and cDNA arrays printed on nylon membranes. Using this approach, we identified a number of genes that were consistently differentially expressed between CLL and NBC samples.","['Wang, J', 'Coombes, K R', 'Highsmith, W E', 'Keating, M J', 'Abruzzo, L V']","['Wang J', 'Coombes KR', 'Highsmith WE', 'Keating MJ', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/classification/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/classification/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Software']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/bioinformatics/bth381 [doi]', 'bth381 [pii]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2004 Nov 22;20(17):3166-78. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth381.

In this study, the ability of A. camphorata to induce apoptosis was studied in cultured human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Treatment of the HL-60 cells with a variety of concentrations of the fermented culture broth of A. camphorata (25-150 microg/ml) resulted in dose- and time-dependent sequences of events marked by apoptosis, as shown by loss of cell viability, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, apoptosis in the HL-60 cells was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and specific proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This increase in A. camphorata-induced apoptosis was also associated with a reduction in the levels of Bcl-2, a potent cell-death inhibitor, and an increase in those of the Bax protein, which heterodimerizes with and thereby inhibits Bcl-2. The data suggest that A. camphorata exerts antiproliferative action and growth inhibition on HL-60 cells through apoptosis induction and that it may have anticancer properties valuable for application in drug products.","['Hseu, You-Cheng', 'Yang, Hsin-Ling', 'Lai, Yu-Ching', 'Lin, Jaung-Geng', 'Chen, Guan-Wei', 'Chang, Yung-Hsien']","['Hseu YC', 'Yang HL', 'Lai YC', 'Lin JG', 'Chen GW', 'Chang YH']","['Department of Food Science, Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Genes, bcl-2/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Polyporaceae/*chemistry']",,2004/07/03 05:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/s15327914nc4802_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2004;48(2):189-97. doi: 10.1207/s15327914nc4802_9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total number of 3259 blood samples from drug users, sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients, prostitutes and blood donors for serologic assays during 1999 to 2002, were collected. All samples were screened for HTLV-I/II antibody, using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. All of the positive samples were confirmed by western blot (WB) kits. Statistical analysis was done by Epi software, and chi(2) test by Fisher's exact test. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence rate of HTLV-I/II in healthy populations was 0.06% including, 0.32% in drug users, 0.58% in STD patients and prostitutes respectively. HTLV-II had not been found. The seropositive rates for HTLV-I in STD patients and prostitutes were significantly higher than the findings among healthy populations (P < 0.05). There were no different seroprevalence rates between drug users and healthy populations (P > 0.05). No significant changes in HTLV-I prevalence rates were found in the different age groups as well as in Fuzhou and Linde cities (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The result suggested that in the east coastal areas of Fujian province, HTLV-I was the main prevalent virus. The seroprevalence of HTLV-I was very low, with no HTLV-II.

In recent years we identified substantial pools of Bcl-2 and Bax in nucleoplasm as well. We demonstrated that nuclear Bcl-2 controls cellular proliferation and, in an indirect manner, apoptosis. Sound support for functional presence of nuclear Bcl-2 and Bax would be evidence of Bcl-2-Bax binding in this compartment. Here we show by immunoprecipitation-using a battery of commercially available, monoclonal antibodies-that Bcl-2 binds Bax in nuclei of human breast cancer cells. Interestingly, findings by others pointed at an interaction between the product of the promyelocytic leukemia gene, the PML protein, and Bax. PML plays a part in cell proliferation and apoptosis, a rather similar role we assigned to nuclear Bcl-2. Nuclear Bcl-2, but not Bax, was found to immunoprecipitate with nuclear PML.

This apoptotic effect is independent of COX I or COX II inhibition, p53, Bcl-2, or cell-cycle arrest. Preclinical evidence suggests that exisulind also inhibits angiogenesis. Cell Pathways has formed sales and distribution agreements with three healthcare-related companies in the US for its future marketing and support campaign for exisulind. Innovex will hire and train sales representatives for Cell Pathways to launch and promote exisulind, Livingston Healthcare Services will be responsible for customer service, order and distribution administration, and Lash Group will be responsible for the development and implementation of reimbursement support services for exisulind. Cell Pathways has issued an exclusive licence for exisulind to Paladin Labs of Montreal, Canada. The agreement allows Paladin exclusive rights to commercialise the drug in Canada. In August 1999 Cell Pathways submitted an NDA application to the US FDA for exisulind (Aptosyn) for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). However, in September 2000, the FDA announced that it had found deficiencies in the safety and efficacy data of Cell Pathways' NDA, and returned a non-approvable letter to the company. Cell Pathways then initiated another phase III study of the agent in combination with Aventis' docetaxel and comparing combination therapy with docetaxel alone. Exisulind has fast-track designation for FAP in the US. Phase I and II paediatric trials are also underway in the US. Cell Pathways announced in April 2000 that it had completed enrollment in an open-label phase II study in children with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Patients will be evaluated to determine whether polyp numbers have been reduced after 1 year relative to baseline. In June 2000, Cell Pathways announced the results of a 1-year extension of a 1997-1999 phase III trial that showed that exisulind significantly reduced polyp formation in patients with FAP. Enrollment of 282 patients in a multicentre, placebo-controlled phase III trial for the treatment of sporadic colonic polyps was completed in the US in May 1999. In its 2003 Annual Report, Paladin Labs announced that it is conducting a phase III study of exisulind in patients with prostate cancer in Canada. Exisulind has completed a pivotal phase II/III trial for preventing the recurrence of prostate cancer in the US. Two phase II prostate cancer trials were initiated in June 1999. The first study assessed the efficacy of exisulind in 15 patients who had undergone prostatectomy, were receiving LHRH-agonist hormone therapy and had increasing PSA levels (study EX1001). The second trial was to enroll 20 hormone-refractory patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy within 2-8 weeks of diagnosis (study EX1004). This study compared the effect of exisulind + docetaxel on the rate of apoptosis and GMP-PDE expression in premalignant or malignant and normal prostate tissue. Cell Pathways and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (now Aventis) agreed to collaborate on clinical trials of exisulind in combination with docetaxel in the treatment of various solid tumours. The first phase I/II trial (study 026) was to enroll previously untreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). OSI Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers Squibb are conducting a phase I/II trial (study EX 2002) of exisulind in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC. Both companies will share costs and information gathered from the SCLC. Both companies will share costs and information gathered from the trial. A phase I/II trial (study EX 2006) of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin combined with exisulind is also underway in patients with advanced NSCLC. Cell Pathways and Glaxo Wellcome are cooperating in supporting a clinical trial (study EX 2004) of exisulind in combination with vinorelbine as first-line treatment for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. The study will be conducted at the University of Wisconsin, and the two companies will share the costs of the trial while maintaining the rights to their respective compounds. Cell Pathways and Eli Lilly have a phase I/II trial (study EX 2005) of exisulind in combination with gemcitabine underway in patients with NSCLC. This study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of escalating doses of exisulind in combination with a standard gemcitabine regimen. The Cancer and Leukaemia Group B (CALGB) initiated a phase II study of exisulind in combination with etoposide and carboplatin in patients with small cell lung cancer in the US in September 2002. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) initiated a phase II study in NSCLC patients in September 2002 that will investigate the effects of exisulind in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin. The objectives of the two studies are to determine the 12-month survival rate and response rates following treatment with the combination regimens. Patents covering the mechanism of action of exisulind have been allowed in Europe and Japan, and extend to the methods of identifying compounds that selectively stimulate apoptosis in precancerous and cancerous cells.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs R D,Drugs in R&D,100883647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', 'K619IIG2R9 (sulindac sulfone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",21,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/12/21 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['547 [pii]', '10.2165/00126839-200405040-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs R D. 2004;5(4):220-6. doi: 10.2165/00126839-200405040-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clofarabine's nucleoside structure is such that both the purine and ribose rings are halogenated, which allows it to inhibit DNA synthesis at two critical junctures: DNA polymerase I and RNA reductase. An intravenous infusion and an oral formulation are undergoing clinical development. Clofarabine was originated by the Southern Research Institute. In August 1998 Bioenvision signed a co-development agreement with the Southern Research Institute, under which it obtained the right to manufacture, market and distribute clofarabine worldwide, except Japan and Southeast Asia. In addition, the company appears to have licensed rights from the Institute that cover the development and marketing of other purine nucleoside analogues that have relevance in the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma. Bioenvision will pay royalties to the Southern Research Institute for sales of clofarabine. Bioenvision extended its option in May 2004 to manufacture, market and distribute clofarabine in Japan and Southeast Asia, and is seeking a co-marketing partner to convert the option into a license agreement following the terms agreed upon between Bioenvision and the Southern Research Institute. Bioenvision and ILEX Products (a wholly owned subsidiary of ILEX Oncology) signed an agreement in February 2004 that converted ILEX's option (agreed in March 2001) to market and distribute clofarabine in the US and Canada. As part of the deal, Bioenvision received a $US3.5 million payment from ILEX in December 2003. In March 2004, Genzyme Corporation announced that it had signed a merger agreement with ILEX Oncology under which ILEX shareholders will receive shares of Genzyme common stock valued at approximately $US1 billion in equity value. Genzyme's business combination with ILEX is expected to be completed by the middle of 2004, Genzyme will, therefore, acquire a considerable boost to its product portfolio. Bioenvision obtained the exclusive option from the Southern Research Institute in September 2003 to manufacture, market and distribute clofarabine in Japan and Southeast Asia. Bioenvision stated it was actively seeking a co-marketing partner to convert this option into a license. Bioenvision announced in June 2003 that it had formed two separate agreements with Ferro Pfanstiehl Laboratories. The agreements cover worldwide development and supply of clofarabine, excluding the US and Canada. Ferro Pfanstiehl has more than 25 years of experience in potent compound manufacturing. The US FDA granted clofarabine fast-track designation for the treatment of refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children in September 2003. Clofarabine has also been granted orphan drug status by the US FDA for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In December 2001, clofarabine was granted orphan drug status in the EU for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with ALL. A single-agent phase II study has been completed in patients with acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Results of a phase II study of clofarabine in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia in older adults who are not considered suitable for intensive chemotherapy have been very positive, with a 64% response rate in these patients being reported. In May 2004, Bioenvision announced that it had decided to stop enrollment at 25 evaluable patients (initially anticipated to be approximately 37 patients) because of the encouraging interim results. It said the trial would conclude earlier than expected and be completed by the end of June 2004. The pivotal trial will enroll approximately 65 patients with AML considered unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. Bioenvision currently has phase II trials ongoing in adult and paediatric patients with acute leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In addition, Bioenvision-sponsored phase I/II clinical trials of clofarabine in patients with CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are underway in Europe. In July 2002, ILEX began two US multicentre, open-label, phase II trials in children with relapsed or refractory AML or ALL. Children enrolled in the studies receive an intravenous infusion of clofarabine over 2 hours for five consecutive days every 2-6 weeks. In June 2003, at the 39th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO-2003), an overall response rate of 28% was reported for clofarabine therapy in heavily pretreated children with acute leukaemia. In September 2003, a multicentre European phase II trial (BIOV-111) was initiated in children with relapsed/refractory ALL. In December 2003, the first of 65 patients received treatment. As part of the global development programme, Bioenvision and ILEX are also conducting a phase II study in adult patients with AML. The companies are planning to investigate the potential use of clofarabine in combination with DNA-damaging agents, because clofarabine has been shown to inhibit DNA repair and may, therefore, potentiate the effects of DNA damaging drugs. A phase I/II trial of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) in adult patients with first relapse AML, ALL, CML blast crisis and myelodysplastic syndrome was initiated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre in October 2002. Clofarabine has completed US phase I trials, and has reported favourable results in patients with leukaemia and solid tumours, including breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. A phase I/II trial in patients with solid tumours was initiated in July 2002. In addition, ILEX said it intended to develop an oral formulation of clofarabine for the treatment of colorectal cancer.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs R D,Drugs in R&D,100883647,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clofarabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",17,2004/07/03 05:00,2004/12/21 09:00,['2004/07/03 05:00'],"['2004/07/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['545 [pii]', '10.2165/00126839-200405040-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs R D. 2004;5(4):213-7. doi: 10.2165/00126839-200405040-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the growth-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing effects of jasmonates on human myeloid leukemia cells were examined. Several myeloid leukemia cells were cultured with methyl jasmonate (MJ) and its derivatives. Cell differentiation was determined by nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing activity, morphological changes, alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity and expression of differentiation-associated surface antigens. MJ induced both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. MJ activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the cells before causing myelomonocytic differentiation. MAPK activation was necessary for MJ-induced differentiation, since PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase, suppressed the differentiation induced by MJ. MJ also induced the differentiation of other human leukemia cell lines. Introduction of a double bond at the 4,5-position greatly enhanced the differentiation-inducing activity of MJ. MJ and its derivatives potently induce the differentiation of some myelomonocytic leukemia cells. One novel derivative is a particularly promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia.","['Ishii, Y', 'Kiyota, H', 'Sakai, S', 'Honma, Y']","['Ishii Y', 'Kiyota H', 'Sakai S', 'Honma Y']","['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Plant Growth Regulators)', '6RI5N05OWW (jasmonic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Oxylipins', 'Plant Growth Regulators/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/07/02 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/07/02 05:00'],"['2004/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403421 [doi]', '2403421 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1413-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 44 consecutive pts (34 males, 10 females) with a median age of 57 years (range 33-77) at the time of initiation of 2-CdA treatment were analyzed. In all, 11 pts were pretreated with either splenectomy (n=6), interferon alpha (n=9) or deoxycoformycin (dCF) (n=3) or all procedures in sequence. Two pts treated with dCF did not respond to dCF, but only 2-CdA. The median time to the start of 2-CdA treatment of the 11 pretreated pts was 47 months (mo) (10-160).

Bone marrow biopsies were performed at the time of recovery of hematopoiesis, thereafter at 2-3 mo intervals, thereafter at 6 mo, and finally annually in 35 pts. The median follow-up is 8.5 years (0.1-12.2). Disease-free survival from the start of 2-CdA treatment is 36% at 12 years (median 8.4 years), 17/44 pts relapsed. Nine of these pts were treated with 2-CdA again, eight achieved a second CR (median 2.5 yrs), one pt did not respond. Eight of our cohort had a second malignancy before receiving 2-CdA. Six pts died in CR due to the second malignancy. The overall survival at 12 years after the start of 2-CdA treatment is 79%. 2-CdA is a safe and effective treatment of HCL inducing complete remissions in the majority of pts with only a single cycle of 2-CdA, and a paucity of toxicities.

The present study was undertaken to determine changes in myocardial gene expression involved in Cu deficient (CuD) cardiomyopathy and its reversal by CuR. Analysis was performed on three groups of mice: 4-week-old CuD mice that exhibited signs of cardiac failure, their age-matched copper-adequate (CuA) controls, and the CuD mice that were re-fed adequate Cu for 2 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from hearts and subjected to cDNA micro-array and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Dietary CuD caused a decrease in cardiac mRNA of beta-MHC, L-type Ca(2+) channel, K-dependent NCX, MMP-2, -8, and -13, NF-kappaB, and VEGF. The mRNA levels of ET-1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and procollagen-I-alpha1 and III-alpha1 were increased in the CuD cardiac tissue. Copper repletion resulted in cardiac mRNA levels of most of the genes examined returning to control levels, although the K-dependent NCX and MMP-2 values did not reach those of the CuA control. In addition, CuR caused an increase in beta-MHC, L-type Ca(2+)channel, MMP-13 to levels surpassing those of CuA control, and a decrease in ET-1, and TNF-alpha mRNA levels. In summary, changes in gene expression of elements involved in contractility, Ca(2+) cycling, and inflammation and fibrosis may account for the altered cardiac function found in CuD mice. The return to normal cardiac function by CuR may be a result of the favorable regression in gene expression of these critical components in myocardial tissue.","['Elsherif, Laila', 'Jiang, Youchun', 'Saari, Jack T', 'Kang, Y James']","['Elsherif L', 'Jiang Y', 'Saari JT', 'Kang YJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, 511 South Floyd Street, MDR 530, Louisville, KY 40292, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (Thrombospondin 1)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Copper/*deficiency/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Heart/drug effects/*physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Procollagen/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombospondin 1/genetics']",,2004/07/02 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/07/02 05:00'],"['2004/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['229/7/616 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2004 Jul;229(7):616-22.,,,,,"['HL59225/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL63760/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to assess whether the study of lineage genes at the RNA level would enable differentiation of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) from B-and T-lineage acute lymphoid leukemias (ALLs). METHODS: We measured mRNA of four lineage markers [CD19, CD79a, CD3e, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] by reverse transcription followed by real-time quantitative (RTQ)-PCR. We investigated 72 acute leukemias (40 AMLs with 23-93% blast cells plus 27 B-lineage ALLs and 5 T-lineage ALLs) defined by morphologic criteria at diagnosis. RTQ-PCR analysis was performed on bone marrow without cell sorting. The expression of each gene was calculated as the difference in the threshold cycle [DeltaCT; CT value of target gene minus CT value of housekeeping gene (Abelson)]. RESULTS: Three patterns of expression were detected. In the first, CD19, CD79a, and MPO mRNAs were less abundant than CD3e. In the second pattern, MPO mRNA was more abundant than the other three mRNAs. In the third, CD19 or CD79a was more highly expressed than CD3e and MPO. The three patterns corresponded to T-ALL, AML, and B-ALL, respectively. The use of cutoffs to establish qualitatively the pattern of coexpression of the four lineage markers provided the same information as the comparison among the four DeltaCT values. Prospective use of the scoring system correctly classified each of 13 additional cases (8 AML, 4 B-lineage ALL, and 1 T-lineage ALL). CONCLUSION: Study of lineage markers at diagnosis by RTQ-PCR allows differentiation of AML from B-ALL or T-ALL without cell sorting, even when the bone marrow contains few blast cells.","['Saussoy, Pascale', 'Vaerman, Jean-Luc', 'Straetmans, Nicole', 'Deneys, Veronique', 'Cornu, Guy', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Latinne, Dominique']","['Saussoy P', 'Vaerman JL', 'Straetmans N', 'Deneys V', 'Cornu G', 'Ferrant A', 'Latinne D']","['Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc, Service de Biologie Hematologique, Brussels, Belgium.

Darker, more permanent, and earlier dye formulations may be more carcinogenic than other dye types. For 769 adult acute leukemia cases and 623 population-based controls in a US and Canadian case-control study in 1986-1989, the authors asked separately about use of permanent and nonpermanent (semipermanent and temporary) hair dye use. Use was reported by 45% of women and 6% of men. There was a modest positive association for ever use of permanent dyes (odds ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 2.1), which was stronger for long duration (15 or more years) of use (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 3.1). The greatest odds ratio was for 15 or more years of using hair dyes up to six times per year (odds ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 5.8); the corresponding odds ratio for use six or more times a year was lower, suggesting the possibility of misclassification of dye type among frequent users, since nonpermanent dyes tend to be used more frequently than permanent dyes. Nonpermanent dyes were not associated with risk. Long duration of permanent dye use may have a larger impact on the risk of adult acute leukemia and other hematopoietic cancers than prior epidemiologic data suggest.","['Rauscher, Garth H', 'Shore, David', 'Sandler, Dale P']","['Rauscher GH', 'Shore D', 'Sandler DP']","['Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. garthr@uic.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['0 (Hair Dyes)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Hair Dyes/*adverse effects/classification', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2004/07/02 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/07/02 05:00'],"['2004/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/aje/kwh166 [doi]', '160/1/19 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2004 Jul 1;160(1):19-25. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwh166.,,['Copyright 2004 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no significant difference in clinical manifestation and blood test between the groups of Ly(+)AML and Ly(-)AML when they were newly diagnosed. Only one case gained long-term remission using standard chemotherapy.

Among them, nine and eleven cases were analyzed by DC-SF-FISH and DC-DF-FISH, respectively. The results showed that 42 out of 643 (6.5%) CML cases received CCA were found to have VT, which were composed of 18 cases of simple VT, 23 of complex VT and one of masked VT. The VT involved all over the chromosomes but No. 4 and 6. Four patterns of them appeared recurrent because each occurred in at least two cases. VT with additional chromosomal aberrations were shown in 35.7% of patients with VT (15/42). 19 of 20 patients who received FISH detection were positive for bcr/abl fusion. DC-DF-FISH analysis revealed absence of abl/bcr fusion signal in all patients but one (8.8%) with abl/bcr positive cells. However, it was not an implication of gene loss but the translocation led to part of bcr retaining on der (9q34) and other part of bcr translocating to involve another chromosome. It was unable to observe variant signal features by DC-SF-FISH analysis. In conclusion, variant Ph translocations in CML involved almost all chromosomes in a varying frequencies and ways except chromosomes 9 and 22, and some of them showed recurrent aberrations.

DGKdelta1 or its PH (pleckstrin homology) domain alone has been shown to be translocated to the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm in PMA-treated cells. In the present study, we identified Ser-22 and Ser-26 within the PH domain as the PMA- and epidermal-growth-factor-dependent phosphorylation sites of DGKdelta1. Experiments in vitro and with intact cells suggested that the cPKC (conventional protein kinase C) phosphorylated these Ser residues directly. Puzzlingly, alanine/asparagine mutants at Ser-22 and Ser-26 of DGKdelta1 and its PH domain are still persistently translocated by PMA treatment, suggesting that the PH domain phosphorylation is not responsible for the enzyme translocation and that the translocation was caused by a PMA-dependent, but cPKC-independent, process yet to be identified. Interestingly, the aspartate mutation, which mimics phosphoserine, at Ser-22 or Ser-26, inhibited the translocation of full-length DGKdelta1 and the PH domain markedly, suggesting that the phosphorylation regulates negatively the enzyme translocation. Our results provide evidence of the phosphorylation of the DGKdelta1 PH domain by cPKC, and suggest that the phosphorylation is involved in the control of subcellular localization of DGKdelta1.","['Imai, Shin-Ichi', 'Kai, Masahiro', 'Yamada, Keiko', 'Kanoh, Hideo', 'Sakane, Fumio']","['Imai S', 'Kai M', 'Yamada K', 'Kanoh H', 'Sakane F']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, South-1, West-17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (DGKD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,2004/07/02 05:00,2005/03/08 09:00,['2004/07/02 05:00'],"['2004/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2004/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20040681 [doi]', 'BJ20040681 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Sep 15;382(Pt 3):957-66. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040681.,,,,,,,,,PMC1133971,,,,,,,,,

They are converted in vivo to the active 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). One person in 300 in white populations has low or undetectable TPMT activity and is at risk for accumulating 6-TGN with the consequence of severe, life-threatening myelosuppression. A rational therapeutic strategy for thiopurine drug use is to first determine TPMT phenotype/genotype and then to adjust the dosage on an individual basis. Determination of erythrocyte 6-TGN levels can further help to optimize therapy. TPMT activity (phenotype) is determined in erythrocytes using radiochemical or HPLC procedures. Recent HPLC procedures show good agreement with the original radiochemical method, while offering simplified sample pretreatment and improved precision. To date, 12 mutant alleles responsible for TPMT deficiency have been published. Restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and allele-specific PCR have been used for detection of TPMT mutations. Genotyping methods that allow a higher throughput include real-time PCR (LightCycler) and denaturing HPLC. Numerous HPLC methods have been reported for quantification of 6-TGN. The majority involve acid hydrolysis to 6-TG at high temperature. There are substantial differences in the hydrolysis step, extraction procedure, chromatographic conditions and method of detection. Erythrocyte 6-TGN concentrations can vary up to 2.6-fold depending on the HPLC method. The method that has found the greatest application in clinical studies is that of Lennard. This has served as the basis for the establishment of treatment-related therapeutic ranges for thiopurine therapy. These ranges will not necessarily be applicable when other methodology is used. There is an urgent need to harmonize the analytic procedures for 6-TGN.","['Armstrong, Victor W', 'Shipkova, Maria', 'von Ahsen, Nicolas', 'Oellerich, Michael']","['Armstrong VW', 'Shipkova M', 'von Ahsen N', 'Oellerich M']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, George-August University, D-37075 Goettingen, Germany. varmstro@med.uni-goettingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Purines)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Purines/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",53,2004/07/02 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2004/07/02 05:00'],"['2004/07/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007691-200404000-00024 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2004 Apr;26(2):220-6. doi: 10.1097/00007691-200404000-00024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although 11p15 is a 'hot spot' for methylation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the role of Dkk-3 abnormalities has never been evaluated in this disease. We analysed CpG island methylation of the Dkk-3 promoter in six ALL cell lines and 183 ALL patients. We observed Dkk-3 hypermethylation in all cell lines and in cells from 33% (60/183) of ALL patients. Moreover, Dkk-3 methylation was associated with decreased Dkk-3 mRNA expression and this expression was restored after exposure to the demethylating agent 5-AzaC. Clinical features did not differ between hypermethylated and unmethylated patients. Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival at 10 and 11 years, respectively, were 49.8 and 45.6% for normal patients and 10.5 and 15.1% for hypermethylated patients (P=0.001 and 0.09). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Dkk-3 methylation was an independent prognostic factor predicting DFS (P=0.0009). Our data suggest that Dkk-3 methylation occurs at an early stage in ALL pathogenesis and probably influences the clinical behaviour of the disease.","['Roman-Gomez, J', 'Jimenez-Velasco, A', 'Agirre, X', 'Castillejo, J A', 'Navarro, G', 'Barrios, M', 'Andreu, E J', 'Prosper, F', 'Heiniger, A', 'Torres, A']","['Roman-Gomez J', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Agirre X', 'Castillejo JA', 'Navarro G', 'Barrios M', 'Andreu EJ', 'Prosper F', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A']","['1Hematology Department, Molecular Biology Unit, Reina Sofia Hospital, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. peperosa@teleline.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (DKK3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chemokines', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/09/15 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6602008 [doi]', '6602008 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2004 Aug 16;91(4):707-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602008.,,,,,,,,,PMC2364778,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that early hematopoietic progenitors (Sca-1(+) c-Kit(+) Lin(-)) isolated from normal mice rapidly undergo apoptosis in the absence of cytokines. In these cells, the expression of Bim, a proapoptotic relative of Bcl-2 which plays a key role in the cytokine-mediated survival system, is induced. In contrast, those cells isolated from our previously established CML model mice resist apoptosis in cytokine-free medium without the induction of Bim expression, and these effects are reversed by the Abl-specific kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. In addition, the expression levels of Bim are uniformly low in cell lines established from patients in the blast crisis phase of CML, and imatinib induced Bim in these cells. Moreover, small interfering RNA that reduces the expression level of Bim effectively rescues CML cells from apoptosis caused by imatinib. These findings suggest that Bim plays an important role in the apoptosis of early hematopoietic progenitors and that Bcr-Abl supports cell survival in part through downregulation of this cell death activator.","['Kuribara, Ryoko', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Shinjyo, Tetsuharu', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Nakazawa, Shinpei', 'Hirai, Hisamaru', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Kuribara R', 'Honda H', 'Matsui H', 'Shinjyo T', 'Inukai T', 'Sugita K', 'Nakazawa S', 'Hirai H', 'Ozawa K', 'Inaba T']","['Department of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.14.6172-6183.2004 [doi]', '24/14/6172 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jul;24(14):6172-83. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.14.6172-6183.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC434248,,,,,,,,,

Two long terminal repeats (LTRs) flank the integrated provirus. The upstream and downstream LTRs carry identical promoter sequences. Studies with other retroviruses suggest that the downstream promoter is silent and that RNA polymerases initiating at the upstream promoter proceed through the 3' LTR. In this study, we used the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to compare the binding of transcription regulatory proteins at both the upstream and downstream promoters in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma cells. Unexpectedly, we detected a nearly equal distribution of activator (Tax, CREB, ATF-1, ATF-2, c-Fos, and c-Jun) and regulatory protein (CBP, p300, TAF(II)250, and polymerase II) binding at both the upstream and downstream promoters. Consistent with this observation, we found that the downstream promoter was transcriptionally active, suggesting that the two promoters are functionally equivalent. We also detected asymmetrical binding of histone deacetylases (HDAC-1, -2, and -3) at both promoters. All three HDACs strongly repressed Tax transactivation, and this repression correlated with displacement of Tax from the HTLV-1 promoter. These effects were reciprocal, as Tax expression reversed HDAC repression and displaced HDACs from the HTLV-1 promoter. These data suggest that HTLV-1 transcriptional regulation at both the 5' and 3' LTRs is mediated, in part, through the mutually exclusive binding of Tax and HDACs at the proviral promoters.","['Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Polakowski, Nicholas J', 'Laybourn, Paul J', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Lemasson I', 'Polakowski NJ', 'Laybourn PJ', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"[""3' Flanking Region/*genetics"", ""5' Flanking Region/*genetics"", 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.14.6117-6126.2004 [doi]', '24/14/6117 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jul;24(14):6117-26. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.14.6117-6126.2004.,,,,,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC434238,,,,,,,,,

Cross-linking CD70 with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) stimulated cytotoxicity and cytokine production in human T cell clones. Detection of intracellular-free calcium mobilization and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation upon mAb engagement of CD70 further supported an active signaling role for the TNF-related molecule. Similar results were obtained in the Jurkat leukaemia T cell line stably transfected with CD70; in that system, induction of Akt phosphorylation was detected, indirectly revealing the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway. Stimulation of CD70+ Jurkat cells, with a CD70-specific mAb or with COS-7 cells transiently transfected with CD27, induced transcriptional activity detectable by different reporter gene expression systems.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1987 and 1995, 369 children treated on two consecutive Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium protocols for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia were randomly assigned to conventionally fractionated CRT (CFX) or hyperfractionated CRT (HFX) to a total dose of 18 Gy. Neuropsychologic testing was completed for 125 of 287 children in continuous complete remission. Event-free and overall survival, as well as neuropsychologic function, were compared for the two arms of the protocol. RESULTS: Eight-year event-free survival (+/- SE) was 80% +/- 3% for children randomly assigned to CFX and 72% +/- 3% for HFX (P =.06). Overall survival was 85% +/- 3% for CFX and 78% +/- 3% for HFX (P =.06). CNS relapses occurred in 2.8% of patients receiving CFX and 2.7% receiving HFX (P =.99). Cognitive function for both groups was solidly in the average range, with no group differences in intelligence, academic achievement, visuospatial reasoning, or verbal learning. Children on the HFX arm exhibited a modest advantage for visual memory (P <.05). CONCLUSION: HFX provides no benefit in terms of cognitive late effects and may compromise antileukemic efficacy. HFX should not be substituted for conventionally dosed CRT in children who require radiation therapy for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Waber, Deborah P', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Catania, Lori', 'Mautz, William', 'Rue, Montse', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Levy, Donna E', 'Goldwasser, Meredith A', 'Adams, Heather', 'Dufresne, Annie', 'Metzger, Victoria', 'Romero, Ivonne', 'Tarbell, Nancy J', 'Dalton, Virginia Kimball', 'Sallan, Stephen E']","['Waber DP', 'Silverman LB', 'Catania L', 'Mautz W', 'Rue M', 'Gelber RD', 'Levy DE', 'Goldwasser MA', 'Adams H', 'Dufresne A', 'Metzger V', 'Romero I', 'Tarbell NJ', 'Dalton VK', 'Sallan SE']","[""Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital and harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. deborah.waber@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.10.173 [doi]', '22/13/2701 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jul 1;22(13):2701-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.10.173.,,,,,"['CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-HD18655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore whether expression profiling of leukemic blasts could accurately distinguish between the known risk groups of AML, we analyzed 130 pediatric and 20 adult AML diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples using the Affymetrix U133A microarray. Class discriminating genes were identified for each of the major prognostic subtypes of pediatric AML, including t(15;17)[PML-RARalpha], t(8;21)[AML1-ETO], inv(16) [CBFbeta-MYH11], MLL chimeric fusion genes, and cases classified as FAB-M7. When subsets of these genes were used in supervised learning algorithms, an overall classification accuracy of more than 93% was achieved. Moreover, we were able to use the expression signatures generated from the pediatric samples to accurately classify adult de novo AMLs with the same genetic lesions. The class discriminating genes also provided novel insights into the molecular pathobiology of these leukemias. Finally, using a combined pediatric data set of 130 AMLs and 137 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, we identified an expression signature for cases with MLL chimeric fusion genes irrespective of lineage. Surprisingly, AMLs containing partial tandem duplications of MLL failed to cluster with MLL chimeric fusion gene cases, suggesting a significant difference in their underlying mechanism of transformation.","['Ross, Mary E', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Zhou, Xiaodong', 'Song, Guangchun', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Ma, Jing', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Girtman, Kevin', 'Williams, W Kent', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Downing, James R']","['Ross ME', 'Mahfouz R', 'Onciu M', 'Liu HC', 'Zhou X', 'Song G', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Pounds S', 'Cheng C', 'Ma J', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Girtman K', 'Williams WK', 'Raimondi SC', 'Liang DC', 'Shih LY', 'Pui CH', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-03-1154 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51092-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 1;104(12):3679-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-1154.

In contrast, this compound has no effect on the growth and viability of Bcr-Abl-negative lymphocytic and myeloid cell lines and primary CML cells. Sodium chlorogenate (NaChl) exhibits 2-fold higher efficiency in killing K562 cells compared with Chl. NaChl also induces growth inhibition of squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) and salivary gland tumor cells (HSG), although at 50-fold higher concentration. NaChl inhibits autophosphorylation of p210(Bcr-Abl) fusion protein rapidly. We demonstrate that p38 phosphorylation is increased in Bcr-Abl-positive cells after treatment with NaChl and closely paralleled the inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation. NaChl did not increase phosphorylation of p38 in Bcr-Abl-negative cells including HSC-2 and HSG that are responsive to this compound, indicating that p38 activation by NaChl is dependent on Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition. Inhibition of p38 activity by SB203580 significantly reduced NaChl-induced apoptosis of K562 cells, whereas activation of p38 by anisomycin augmented the apoptosis. These findings indicate that inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase leading to activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase may play an important role in the anti-CML activity of Chl.","['Bandyopadhyay, Gautam', 'Biswas, Tanusree', 'Roy, Keshab C', 'Mandal, Swapan', 'Mandal, Chhabinath', 'Pal, Bikas C', 'Bhattacharya, Samir', 'Rakshit, Srabanti', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip K', 'Chaudhuri, Utpal', 'Konar, Aditya', 'Bandyopadhyay, Santu']","['Bandyopadhyay G', 'Biswas T', 'Roy KC', 'Mandal S', 'Mandal C', 'Pal BC', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Rakshit S', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Chaudhuri U', 'Konar A', 'Bandyopadhyay S']","['Division of Immunology, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.

In most cases this is achieved by the reactivation of telomerase, a cellular reverse transcriptase that prevents telomere shortening. Here we report that the telomerase gene (hTERT) promoter is up-regulated during transmission of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) to primary T cells in vitro and in ex vivo adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) samples, but not asymptomatic carriers. Although Tax impaired induction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA in response to mitogenic stimulation, transduction of Tax into primary lymphocytes was sufficient to activate and maintain telomerase expression and telomere length when cultured in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. Transient transfection assays revealed that Tax stimulates the hTERT promoter through the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. Consistently, Tax mutants inactive for NF-kappaB activation could not activate the hTERT or sustain telomere length in transduced primary lymphocytes. Analysis of the hTERT promoter occupancy in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggested that an increased binding of c-Myc and Sp1 is involved in the NF-kappaB-mediated activation of the hTERT promoter. This study establishes the role of Tax in regulation of telomerase expression, which may cooperate with other functions of Tax to promote HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia.","['Sinha-Datta, Uma', 'Horikawa, Izumi', 'Michishita, Eriko', 'Datta, Abhik', 'Sigler-Nicot, Janitzia C', 'Brown, Megan', 'Kazanji, Mirdad', 'Barrett, J Carl', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Sinha-Datta U', 'Horikawa I', 'Michishita E', 'Datta A', 'Sigler-Nicot JC', 'Brown M', 'Kazanji M', 'Barrett JC', 'Nicot C']","['University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, 3025 Wahl Hall West, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Models, Genetic', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4251 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43317-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 15;104(8):2523-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4251.

Very little is known about the molecular basis underlying HOXB4-induced HSC self-renewal. We now report the in vitro proliferation and in vivo expansion capacity of primary bone marrow (BM) cells engineered to overexpress selected HOXB4 point mutants lacking either the capacity to directly bind DNA (HOXB4(A)), or to cooperate with members of the PBX family (HOXB4(W-->G)) in DNA binding. The DNA binding-incompetent HOXB4 mutant failed to enhance the proliferation activity of transduced BM populations in vitro and HSC expansion in vivo. In contrast, the HOXB4(W-->G) mutant conferred a pronounced in vitro proliferation advantage to the transduced BM populations, and dramatically enhanced their in vivo regenerative potential. We also demonstrate a correlation between HOXB4 protein levels and in vitro proliferative capacity of primary BM cells. Our observations thus suggest that the capacity of HOXB4 to induce HSC expansions is DNA-binding dependent and does not require direct HOX/PBX interaction, and sets the stage for identifying HOXB4-dependent targets involved in HSC expansion.","['Beslu, Nathalie', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Laurin, Melanie', 'Mayotte, Nadine', 'Humphries, Keith R', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Beslu N', 'Krosl J', 'Laurin M', 'Mayotte N', 'Humphries KR', 'Sauvageau G']","['The Institut de Recherche en Immunovirologie et en Cancerlogie, Pavillon Roger-Gaudry, Universite de Montreal, C.P.6128, Succursale Centre-ville, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tryptophan/genetics/metabolism']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-04-1653 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43288-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 15;104(8):2307-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1653.

Some mycobacteriums, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, were associated with progression of atherosclerosis and they are interacted with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have been defined as pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition molecules in innate immunity. In the present study, we examined whether human platelets express TLRs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human platelets were obtained from healthy volunteers and the mRNA and protein level of TLRs on platelets and Meg-01 cells, megakaryoblastic cell line, were investigated. RESULTS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that TLR1 and TLR6 mRNA were expressed in platelets and Meg-01 cells. Furthermore, interferon-gamma up-regulated their mRNA levels in dose and time dependent manners after stimuli. Both TLR1 and TLR6 proteins in platelets were detected by Western blotting, and their expression of platelets was more than that of Meg-01 cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the expression of TLR1 and TLR6 on the cell surface of Meg-01 cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis using human coronary thrombi obtained from patients with acute coronary syndrome confirmed the expression of TLR1 and TLR6 on platelets. CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrated that human platelets and Meg-01 cells expressed a family of TLRs for the first time, and our findings indicated that platelets might recognize antigens directly via TLRs. Our findings suggest a possibility that platelets have the ability to recognize the antigens via TLRs and that there are mechanistic relations between infectious inflammation and atherosclerotic vascular diseases.","['Shiraki, Rio', 'Inoue, Nobutaka', 'Kawasaki, Satoru', 'Takei, Asumi', 'Kadotani, Makoto', 'Ohnishi, Yoshio', 'Ejiri, Junya', 'Kobayashi, Seiichi', 'Hirata, Ken-Ichi', 'Kawashima, Seinosuke', 'Yokoyama, Mitsuhiro']","['Shiraki R', 'Inoue N', 'Kawasaki S', 'Takei A', 'Kadotani M', 'Ohnishi Y', 'Ejiri J', 'Kobayashi S', 'Hirata K', 'Kawashima S', 'Yokoyama M']","['Division of Cardiovascular and Respiratory Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TLR6 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 1)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 6)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coronary Thrombosis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 1', 'Toll-Like Receptor 6', 'Toll-Like Receptors']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.thromres.2004.03.023 [doi]', 'S0049384804001847 [pii]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2004;113(6):379-85. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2004.03.023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paricalcitol has anticancer activity in prostate cancer cells. We tested the effects of paricalcitol on the HL-60 leukemia cells, studying cellular differentiation, cell cycle changes, apoptosis and cellular proliferation. Paricalcitol at 10(-8)M concentration induced the maturation of HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner, as shown by increased expression of CD11b differentiation surface antigen. The ability of HL-60 cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) was markedly increased after exposure to paricalcitol at 10(-8)M for 72 h. Paricalcitol inhibited colony formation of HL-60 cells in a soft agar semisolid media after 10-day incubation (estimated IC50 of 5 x 10(-9) M. Exposure to 10(-8)M paricalcitol for 72 h increased the number of cells in G0/G1 phase, and decreased the number of cells in S phase, and significantly increased the number of HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis. The concentration required to achieve inhibition of growth of HL-60 cells is comparable to clinically achievable levels. These findings support the clinical evaluation of paricalcitol as an antileukemia agent.","['Molnar, Istvan', 'Kute, Timothy', 'Willingham, Mark C', 'Schwartz, Gary G']","['Molnar I', 'Kute T', 'Willingham MC', 'Schwartz GG']","['Section on Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (19-nor-1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D2)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ergocalciferols/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.03.064 [doi]', 'S0960076004001190 [pii]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2004 May;89-90(1-5):539-43. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.03.064.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological data suggest that low Vitamin D levels may play a role in the genesis of prostate cancer and perhaps other tumors. Calcitriol is a potent anti-proliferative agent in a wide variety of malignant cell types. In prostate, breast, colorectal, head/neck and lung cancer as well as lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma model systems calcitriol has significant anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Calcitriol effects are associated with an increase in G0/G1 arrest, induction of apoptosis and differentiation, modulation of expression of growth factor receptors. Glucocorticoids potentiate the anti-tumor effect of calcitriol and decrease calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia. Calcitriol potentiates the antitumor effects of many cytotoxic agents and inhibits motility and invasiveness of tumor cells and formation of new blood vessels. Phase I and II trials of calcitriol either alone or in combination with carboplatin, taxanes or dexamethasone have been initiated in patients with androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer and advanced cancer. Data indicate that high-dose calcitriol is feasible on an intermittent schedule, no dose-limiting toxicity has been encountered and optimal dose and schedule are being delineated. Clinical responses have been seen with the combination of high dose calcitriol+dexamethasone in androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC) and apparent potentiation of the antitumor effects of docetaxel have been seen in AIPC. These results demonstrate that high intermittent doses of calcitriol can be administered to patients without toxicity, that the MTD is yet to be determined and that calcitriol has potential as an anti-cancer agent.","['Trump, Donald L', 'Hershberger, Pamela A', 'Bernardi, Ronald J', 'Ahmed, Sharmilla', 'Muindi, Josephia', 'Fakih, Marwan', 'Yu, Wei-Dong', 'Johnson, Candace S']","['Trump DL', 'Hershberger PA', 'Bernardi RJ', 'Ahmed S', 'Muindi J', 'Fakih M', 'Yu WD', 'Johnson CS']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. donald.trump@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",51,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.03.068 [doi]', 'S0960076004001232 [pii]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2004 May;89-90(1-5):519-26. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.03.068.,,,,,"['CA67267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of vitamin D antagonist, TEI-9647, on osteoclast formation induced by 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) from bone marrow cells of patients with Paget's disease. TEI-9647 itself never induced osteoclast formation even at 10(-6)M, but dose-dependently (10(-10) to 10(-6)M) inhibited osteoclast formation induced by physiologic concentrations of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) (41 pg/ml, 10(-10)M) from bone marrow cells of patients with Paget's disease. At the same time, 10(-8)M of TEI-9647 alone did not cause 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) dependent gene expression, but almost completely suppressed TAF(II)-17, a potential coactivator of VDR and 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-24-hydroxylase (25-OH-D(3)-24-hydroxylase) gene expression induced by 10(-10)M 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in bone marrow cells of patients with Paget's disease.

Here, we demonstrate that in myeloid leukemia cells, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment increased the Thr389 phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase. Accordingly, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) decreased VDR-associated Ser/Thr protein phosphatase activity by dissociating VDR-PP1c and VDR-PP2Ac interactions. Further, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) increased the association between VDR and Thr389 phosphorylated p70S6 kinase.

Chromosomes 17 and 21 aneuploidies induced by folate deficiency were measured in mononucleated (MONO) and cytokinesis-blocked binucleated (BN) lymphocytes after dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a digoxigenin-labeled probe for the alphoid satellite sequence of chromosome 17 and a biotin-labeled probe for the pericentric region of chromosome 21. The results showed that 12nm of MF or FA caused a significant 26-35% increment in frequency of aneuploidy of chromosome 17 (P = 0.0017) and aneupoidy of chromosome 21 (P = 0.0008) relative to 120nM MF or FA. The pattern of aneuploidy in binucleated cells was significantly correlated with that observed in mononucleated cells (R = 0.51-0.75, P < 0.0004) and was consistent with a model based on chromosome loss or partial aneusomy rescue as the cause rather than non-disjunction, although the latter mechanism could not be excluded. MF was not more efficient than FA in preventing aneuploidy in this in vitro system. We conclude that folate deficiency is a risk factor for chromosomes 17 and 21 aneuploidy.","['Wang, Xu', 'Thomas, Philip', 'Xue, Jinglun', 'Fenech, Michael']","['Wang X', 'Thomas P', 'Xue J', 'Fenech M']","['State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Folic Acid/blood', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes/diagnostic imaging', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Riboflavin/blood', 'Ultrasonography']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.03.008 [doi]', 'S0027510704001514 [pii]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2004 Jul 13;551(1-2):167-80. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.03.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether HTLV-I infection could modify the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). In this study we compared several inflammatory cytokines, such as C-terminal parathyroid hormone-related peptide (C-PTHrP), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin (IL)-6, and an osteo-destruction marker, deoxypyridinoline, in synovial fluid (SF) samples obtained from 22 HTLV-I carriers and 58 control non-carrier patients with OA. These patients were diagnosed clinically and radiographically with primary OA affecting one or both knee joints, and were similar with regard to age, sex and clinical symptoms. We also performed histopathological examination as well as immunohistochemistry of HTLV-I-derived Tax protein in eight synovial tissues taken from carrier patients. C-PTHrP in SF was significantly higher in HTLV-I carriers (287 +/- 280 pM) than in non-carriers (69 +/- 34 pM), and the concentration in 13 carriers was above the upper range of OA. In HTLV-I carriers, the concentrations of sIL-2R (741 +/- 530 IU/ml), IL-6 (55 +/- 86 ng/ml) and deoxypyridinoline (3.1 +/- 1.8 nM) were higher than in non-carriers (299 +/- 303, 2.5 +/- 4.0, 0.96 +/- 1.0, respectively), and correlated positively with C-PTHrP. C-PTHrP, sIL-2R and IL-6 concentrations in SF positive for IgM antibody against HTLV-I antigen, a marker of persistent viral replication, were higher than of IgM-negative SF. Histologically, five and two synovia showed mild and moderate synovial proliferation with or without some degree of inflammatory reaction, respectively, and could not be distinguished from OA. Tax-positive synoviocytes were observed sparsely in all samples, and often appeared frequently in actively proliferating regions. Our results suggest that although HTLV-I infection does not necessarily worsen the clinical outcome and local synovitis, the virus can potentially modify the pathophysiology of OA by increasing the inflammatory activity in a subset of carrier patients, especially those with IgM antibody. Longitudinal studies are required to assess the association between HTLV-I infection and OA.","['Yoshihara, Yoshiki', 'Tsukazaki, Tomoo', 'Osaki, Makoto', 'Nakashima, Masahiro', 'Hasui, Kazuhisa', 'Shindo, Hiroyuki']","['Yoshihara Y', 'Tsukazaki T', 'Osaki M', 'Nakashima M', 'Hasui K', 'Shindo H']","['Division of Orthopaedic Pathomechanism, Department of Developmental and Reconstructive Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. yyoshihara-jsb@umin.ac.jp <yyoshihara-jsb@umin.ac.jp>']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Collagen Type II)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (chondrocalcin)', '90032-33-0 (deoxypyridinoline)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Collagen Type II', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoarthritis/*genetics/*virology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Synovial Fluid/chemistry']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2005/02/19 09:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/ar1193 [doi]', 'ar1193 [pii]']",ppublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2004;6(4):R347-54. doi: 10.1186/ar1193.

It was recently shown that certain alleles of this repeat are associated with a worse prognosis in CLL patients. To investigate the role of TNR/11q#1 variants as risk-modifying factors in leukemogenesis, we conducted a case-control study on 113 acute lymphotic leukemia (ALL) patients, 82 CLL patients and 146 healthy controls of Russian origin. Comparison of allele and genotype distributions in the control, ALL and CLL groups, performed by Fisher's exact test with two-sized P-value, showed significant decrease in the presence of the GCC(6) allele in the ALL and CLL groups compared to controls. Moreover, 'rare' alleles GCC(7-8) and GCC(13-14) were significantly overrepresented in the ALL group versus controls. We found that CLL risk genotypes were those with both alleles containing more than 6 GCC repeats (P = 0,0212, odds ratio = 1,68 (95% CI, 1,121...2,531)). ALL risk genotypes include three allele combination variants: 1) both alleles containing more than 6 GCC repeats (P = 0,0019, odds ratio = 1,756 (95% CI 1,223...2,502)); 2) one of the alleles containing 7 or 8 repeats (P = 0,0155, odds ratio = 18,22 (95% CI 1,93...136.37)); 3) one of the alleles containing more than 12 repeats (P = 0,0209, Odds ratio = 2,599 (95% CI 1,161...5,815)). Association of certain alleles and genotypes of the TNR/11q#1 repeat with both acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggests the presence of a cancer related gene, involved in a wide spectrum of neoplasia, in the vicinity of this repeat.","['Klinkov, A A', 'Nikitin, E A', 'Maiorova, O V', 'Ivanov, M A', 'Strelnikov, V V', 'Babenko, O V', 'Zemlyakova, V V', 'Kuznetsova, E B', 'Zaletayev, D V']","['Klinkov AA', 'Nikitin EA', 'Maiorova OV', 'Ivanov MA', 'Strelnikov VV', 'Babenko OV', 'Zemlyakova VV', 'Kuznetsova EB', 'Zaletayev DV']","['Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, 115478, Moskvorechie St.1, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Hum Genet,Annals of human genetics,0416661,,IM,"['Adult', '*Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Trinucleotide Repeats/*genetics']",,2004/07/01 05:00,2005/01/07 09:00,['2004/07/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.1529-8817.2004.00101.x [doi]', 'AHG101 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hum Genet. 2004 Jul;68(Pt 4):362-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1529-8817.2004.00101.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a busy reference flow laboratory we provide flow cytometry immunophenotyping for investigation and diagnosis of acute and chronic leukemias, lymphomas, immunodeficiencies, neuroblastoma, platelet disorders, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Because of increasing workload and the continual effort to improve the service to our health care providers, CLS invested in the new Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC 500 5-color flow cytometer. In addition to time and labor savings due to reduced maintenance and operating system design, this new flow cytometer automates many of the previous manual steps involved in quality control and flow cytometric analysis. It also incorporates 2 lasers and is capable of measuring 5-color antibody combinations in a single tube, enabling us to reduce the number of tubes and overall costs, giving us better gating options for minimal residual disease analysis. We present the first published evaluation, an assessment of the overall productivity and cost impact of the new state-of-the-art Cytomics FC 500 flow cytometer. Implementation of the Cytomics FC 500 has resulted in a 20% reduction in reagent costs and shorter turnaround time for analysis and diagnosis. This instrument has allowed us to reduce our acute leukemia panel from 17 to 13 tubes, our lymphoma panel from 13 to 7 tubes, and our ILD panel from 4 to 2 tubes. The availability of 2 lasers provides more flexibility in choosing antibodies and conjugates to customize immunophenotyping panels. It also allows us to use the DRAQ5 dye and simultaneously analyze the immunophenotype and DNA content of cells with very little compensation. Many of the arduous, time-consuming flow operator tasks often associated with previous generation flow cytometry instruments, such as color compensation, list mode analysis, sample repeats, and interpretations, have been substantially reduced with the Cytomics FC 500 5-color flow cytometer. In conclusion the Cytomics FC 500 5-color flow cytometer is a major advance in flow cytometry instrumentation and has reduced our overall reagent costs by 20%, provided better information and speedier turnaround time to our health care professionals. It is an ideal flow cytometer for any busy clinical or research flow cytometry service.","['Luider, J', 'Cyfra, M', 'Johnson, P', 'Auer, I']","['Luider J', 'Cyfra M', 'Johnson P', 'Auer I']","['Calgary Laboratory Services, Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Treatment of MM is a serious challenge, because despite a variety of available therapies, median survival is short. A new therapeutic area focuses on inhibiting the activity of the proteasome, a 26S protease complex involved in cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, inflammation, and protein turnover. The novel proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (Velcade), was recently approved for use in patients with refractory and relapsed MM and to date is the only proteasome inhibitor to have entered clinical trials. Bortezomib has demonstrated activity with manageable toxicity in a variety of hematologic malignancies in addition to MM, including leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This article reviews clinical information on bortezomib in hematologic malignancies both as monotherapy and in combination with dexamethasone. Preliminary reports of bortezomib in combination with Doxil (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), melphalan, and thalidomide are discussed, and current trials are described.

Among the T/NK-cell lymphomas, 40 showed positive immunoreactivity for CD56, and thus they were judged to be NK/T-cell lymphomas. They included one blastic NK-cell lymphoma and 39 NK/T-cell lymphomas. NK/T-cell lymphomas were further divided into three categories based on the main site of lesions: nasal type (23 cases), non-nasal extranodal type (11 cases), and nodal type (5 cases). The positive rate of infection with the Epstein-Barr virus determined by in situ hybridization was 83%, 36%, and 25% in the nasal, non-nasal, and nodal type, respectively.

Twenty-eight percent (27/96) of patients had an abnormal karyotype. FISH identified an additional 27 patients with undetected monosomy 7 or trisomy 8. Those patients with undetected monosomy 7 generally had a poor clinical outcome, suffering from lack of response to medical therapy or early death. In one AA/MDS patient with normal cytogenetics, FISH identified a large population of monosomy 7 cells, which clearly heralded a clinical relapse. In another patient, FISH studies were used to delineate instability of chromosome 8, with apparent disease progression from AA to MDS.

U937 and HL60 cells undergo rapid apoptosis on treatment with HHT, as indicated by increased annexin V binding capacity, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In addition, the expression of bax is upregulated during HHT-induced cell death, whereas the expression of bcl-2 is only slightly decreased.

METHODS: Mcl-1 protein was immunohistochemically examined in 182 patients with gastric carcinoma. The overexpression of p53 was also analyzed in T3 gastric carcinomas. RESULTS: The expression of Mcl-1 was detected in 127 (69.8%) patients with gastric carcinoma. Mcl-1 was detected significantly more frequently in the undifferentiated type ( P < 0.05) and in the advanced stage of disease ( P < 0.05). The prognosis of patients with an Mcl-1-positive tumor was significantly worse than that of those with an Mcl-1-negative tumor ( P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the expression of Mcl-1 was an independent prognostic factor, as were lymph node metastasis and tumor size. There was no significant relationship between the expression of Mcl-1 and p53. In patients with T3 gastric carcinoma who underwent curative surgery; however, Mcl-1(-)/p53 (-) tumor demonstrated the best postoperative survival rate, whereas Mcl-1(+)/p53(+) tumor had the worst. CONCLUSION: The expression of Mcl-1 is an indicator of tumor progression and postoperative recurrence in patients with gastric carcinoma. Combined analysis of Mcl-1 and p53 proteins may accurately predict the survival of patients with T3 gastric carcinoma.","['Maeta, Yoshihiko', 'Tsujitani, Shunichi', 'Matsumoto, Sachiko', 'Yamaguchi, Kenichi', 'Tatebe, Shigeru', 'Kondo, Akira', 'Ikeguchi, Masahide', 'Kaibara, Nobuaki']","['Maeta Y', 'Tsujitani S', 'Matsumoto S', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Tatebe S', 'Kondo A', 'Ikeguchi M', 'Kaibara N']","['Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, 36-1 Nishi-cho, Yonago 683-8504, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Gastric Cancer,Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,100886238,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis/immunology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis/immunology']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2005/03/26 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2003/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10120-004-0272-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Gastric Cancer. 2004;7(2):78-84. doi: 10.1007/s10120-004-0272-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulation of neoplastic B-cells is caused not by their higher proliferation rate, but by their prolonged life-span due to dysregulation of apoptosis. Many proteins act as inducers or inhibitors in controlling apoptosis. A high level of antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein is detected in B cells of B-CLL. Other factors, such as NF-kappaB, PI-3K and PKC, are also involved in the inhibition of malignant cell apoptosis. A high level of p27kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase that correlates with the degree of in vitro apoptosis, is found in B-CLL cells. The autologous interaction between BAFF, APRIL, and their ligands may also be involved in apoptosis inhibition in B-CLL. Some external factors e.g. cytokines, may suppress apoptosis of malignant cells. IL-4, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF are proven inhibitors, while IL-5 and IL-10 are inducers of apoptosis of these cells. Even though there are reports characterizing some mechanisms of B-CLL cell apoptosis, relatively less is still known about the complex regulation of this process. This requires more precise research, as new anti-leukemic drugs influence the regulation of apoptosis of neoplastic B lymphocytes.","['Podhorecka, Monika']",['Podhorecka M'],['Klinika Hematoonkologii i Transplantacji Szpiku Akademii Medycznej w Lublinie.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Interleukin-5/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",75,2004/06/30 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['5589 [pii]'],epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2004 May 24;58:236-42.,Proces apoptozy w patogenezie przewleklej bialaczki limfatycznej B komorkowej.,,,20040524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 7 cases of peripheral T-cell malignancy associated with B-cell-derived CLL from the files of two institutions over a 20-year period. The presence of both B and T lymphoproliferative disorders was confirmed in all cases by immunophenotype and in 6 cases by gene rearrangements. Six patients developed peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), unspecified, during the course of CLL (10-168 months). In all 5 evaluable cases, the cells had a cytotoxic T-cell phenotype; the sixth case was CD56+, but TIA-1 and Granzyme B could not be studied. A seventh patient with CLL developed mycosis fungoides, and an aggressive NK cell leukemia. To investigate possible risk factors for the development of PTCL, we screened 100 unselected peripheral blood samples from newly diagnosed CLL patients by PCR for the presence of clonal T cell populations. We found evidence of clonal T-cell expansion in 8 patients and increased lymphocytes with large granular lymphocyte morphology in 7 of 8 cases. The immunophenotype was assessed by multicolor flow cytometry and in 4 cases the T-cell expansion was composed of either CD3+/CD8+ or CD3+/CD4-/CD8- cells. The cytotoxic nature of the clonal T-cell expansions in the peripheral blood correlates with the cytotoxic nature of the PTCLs, but their role in the subsequent development of T-cell lymphomas is still unclear.

Our purpose was to estimate costs and determine cost predictors. METHODS: We used data from a prospective French study comparing four doses of immunoglobulins. Resource use of hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients during the first 6 months posttransplant, both inpatient and ambulatory costs, in 85 patients from five centers were collected prospectively and costed. Baseline data and clinical events were retrieved. Protocol-driven costs were excluded. Multivariable analysis evaluated the association between costs and patient's pretransplant status and transplant-related complications. Because of the absence of differences in outcome among the four randomization groups, cost data for all patients were pooled. RESULTS: Total costs per patient were the following: mean 76,237 Euros; standard deviation 32,565 Euros; median 69,516 Euros; range 183,758 to 14,761Euros. The major cost driver was hospital days. No association was found between costs and baseline status. The ""predictors"" of higher costs (adding an average 20,000 Euros/patient) were the occurrence of transplant-related complications: graft-versus-host disease and repeated infections that were unpredictable before transplant in this homogeneous group of patients. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the discrepancy between the Diagnosis Related Group prospective payment system and actual costs. The actual cost of geno-identical stem-cell transplantation results from posttransplant complications that cannot be predicted prospectively and require ex post cost adjustment.","['Esperou, Helene', 'Brunot, Alain', 'Roudot-Thoraval, Francoise', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Dhedin, Nathalie', 'Rio, Bernard', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Bassompierre, Francois', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle']","['Esperou H', 'Brunot A', 'Roudot-Thoraval F', 'Buzyn A', 'Dhedin N', 'Rio B', 'Chevret S', 'Bassompierre F', 'Gluckman E', 'Cordonnier C', 'Durand-Zaleski I']","['Hematology Department, St. Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP/HP), 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France. helene.esperou@chu-stlouis.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Placebos)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', '*Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'France', 'Graft vs Host Disease/economics/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/economics', 'Humans', 'Infections/economics/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Placebos', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*economics', 'Transplantation, Homologous/economics', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/economics']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200406270-00013 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000129409.84087.62 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2004 Jun 27;77(12):1854-8. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000129409.84087.62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retina explant cultures derived from timed-pregnant CD-1 mice were used to monitor rod photoreceptor differentiation. CNTF was used to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways. Activation of STAT3 and MAPK were manipulated by using dominant-negative STAT3 recombinant adenoviruses and a specific inhibitor of MAPK, respectively. Explanted retinas were harvested at distinct time points and processed for immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Blocking of the MAPK pathway by the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 did not affect normal development of rods in retina explants or the suppression of their appearance by treatment with CNTF. In contrast, activated STAT3 was necessary for suppression of the rod cell fate decision. A deficiency of the STAT3 pathway induced by a dominant negative STAT3 abolished inhibition of rod development by CNTF. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that STAT3, but not MAPK, can critically regulate photoreceptor development during mouse retina development.","['Zhang, Samuel Shao-Min', 'Wei, Jiye', 'Qin, Hua', 'Zhang, Lixin', 'Xie, Bing', 'Hui, Pei', 'Deisseroth, Albert', 'Barnstable, Colin J', 'Fu, Xin-Yuan']","['Zhang SS', 'Wei J', 'Qin H', 'Zhang L', 'Xie B', 'Hui P', 'Deisseroth A', 'Barnstable CJ', 'Fu XY']","['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Retina/*embryology', 'Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1167/iovs.04-0003 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2004 Jul;45(7):2407-12. doi: 10.1167/iovs.04-0003.,,,,,"['EY00785/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY13607/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY13865/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that certain ""liquid"" tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia not only produce VEGF but also express functional VEGFR, resulting in an autocrine loop for tumor growth and propagation. In addition, the leukemia-derived VEGF can also stimulate the production of growth factors, including interleukin 6 (IL6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), by human endothelial cells, which in turn further promotes the growth of leukemia cells (the paracrine loop). A fully human anti-VEGFR2 (or kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR) antibody, IMC-2C6, strongly blocks KDR/VEGF interaction and neutralizes VEGF-stimulated activation of KDR in endothelial cells. In a system where leukemia cells are co-cultured with endothelial cells, IMC-2C6 inhibits both the production of IL6 and GM-CSF by endothelial cells and the growth of leukemia cells. Finally, IMC-2C6 effectively blocks VEGF-induced migration of KDR+ human leukemia cells, and when administered in vivo, significantly prolonged survival of mice inoculated with KDR+ human leukemia cells. Taken together, our data suggest that anti-KDR antibodies may have broad applications in the treatment of both solid tumors and certain types of leukemia.","['Zhang, Haifan', 'Li, Yiwen', 'Li, Hongli', 'Bassi, Rajiv', 'Jimenez, Xenia', 'Witte, Larry', 'Bohlen, Peter', 'Hicklin, Daniel', 'Zhu, Zhenping']","['Zhang H', 'Li Y', 'Li H', 'Bassi R', 'Jimenez X', 'Witte L', 'Bohlen P', 'Hicklin D', 'Zhu Z']","['Department of Antibody Technology, ImClone Systems Incorporated, New York, New York 10014, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Autocrine Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Paracrine Communication/*drug effects', 'Umbilical Cord/immunology/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001712225 [doi]', '2B15GCCV28YQ8NRM [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Sep;45(9):1887-97. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001712225.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the use of karyotype analysis for risk-stratification is widely accepted, prognosis of AML remains ambiguous, particularly for patients categorized into the intermediate cytogenetic risk group and additional markers are required for an accurate prediction of outcome. For this study, we used multiplex real-time RT-PCR, which can simultaneously quantify WT1 and 10 distinct fusion gene transcripts, to prospectively evaluate the pre-treatment bone marrow findings of 53 de novo AML patients. Five patients with normal karyotype or insufficient metaphases detected by conventional karyotype analysis proved to have AML1-MTG8, CBFbeta-MYH11 or PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts. WT1 overexpression was observed in 92% of the patients, and the levels were significantly higher in the cytogenetic favorable risk group, especially patients with PML-RARalpha. WT1 levels also correlated with the percentage of blasts in bone marrow, especially in cases of core-binding factor leukemia. There was no association between initial WT1 levels and outcome in terms of event-free survival or overall survival. These results suggest that multiplex real-time RT-PCR is rapid and useful for the precise cytogenetic stratification of AML, and that WT1 levels at presentation correlate with several biologic features of leukemia, but have no prognostic significance.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Terakura, Seitaro', 'Yokozawa, Toshiya', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Kitamura, Kunio', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Tanaka, Masafumi', 'Tobita, Tadasu', 'Takeo, Takaaki', 'Sao, Hiroshi', 'Kataoka, Takae', 'Kobayashi, Masahide', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Morishita, Yoshihisa', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Sugiura, Isamu']","['Yanada M', 'Terakura S', 'Yokozawa T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Kiyoi H', 'Emi N', 'Kitamura K', 'Kohno A', 'Tanaka M', 'Tobita T', 'Takeo T', 'Sao H', 'Kataoka T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Takeshita A', 'Morishita Y', 'Naoe T', 'Sugiura I']","['Department of Hematology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. myanada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001693551 [doi]', 'PY4R6UXWRXA5C22D [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Sep;45(9):1803-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001693551.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One female had secondary hypogonadism and hyposomatotropism after cranial RT with 30 Gy, one male had hyposomatotropism after receiving cranial RT twice (49 Gy total). Primary treatment for leukemia does not produce primary hypogonadism in girls, but it does in boys. Alkylating agents and gonadal RT are the most damaging factors.

We have previously shown that short telomeres in chronic phase (CP) predict for early progression to blast phase (BP). Poor prognostic score patients may therefore exhibit increased telomere loss at diagnosis and/or a greater than normal rate of loss during the disease course. We prospectively studied newly diagnosed CML patients for degree of telomere loss; measured telomere length in CML patients at all stages of disease; and performed follow-up sampling according to cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate. Using flow-FISH, telomere length in peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) from 32 consecutive newly diagnosed patients was measured (with ex-vivo expanded T-cells as an internal BCR-ABL negative control), in addition to 65 samples from all CML stages and 7 paired CP/BP samples. Fifty-five normal individuals served as a control population. Patients who attained either a complete cytogenetic response (CCR, 0% Ph+, n = 10) or no CR (100% Ph+, n = 11) underwent follow-up measurement. All statistical tests were two sided. Telomeres in accelerated phase (AP) and BP patients were significantly shorter than in CP, and mean telomere shortening was significantly greater in high-risk score than low-risk patients (P < 0.05) at diagnosis. The rate of shortening during disease progression was 10-20 times the rate observed in normal granulocytes. BP samples had undergone at least 30-60 additional divisions from baseline Ph- telomere length. Our findings show that telomere shortening in CML is greatest in high-risk score patients at diagnosis, and occurs rapidly during disease progression.","['Drummond, Mark', 'Lennard, Anne', 'Brummendorf, Tim', 'Holyoake, Tessa']","['Drummond M', 'Lennard A', 'Brummendorf T', 'Holyoake T']","['HOS, Division of Cancer Sciences and Molecular Pathology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary University of Glasgow, Glasgow G31 2ER, UK. mwd3z@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001693542 [doi]', '415KR0WFK4B576E2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Sep;45(9):1775-81. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001693542.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activated fusion proteins, such as PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO, have been shown to inhibit cellular differentiation by recruitment of nuclear corepressor complexes, which maintain local histone deacetylase (HDAC) in a variety of hematologic lineage-specific gene promoters. This HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression appears as a common pathway in the development of leukemia and could represent an important target for new therapeutic agents. On the other hand, the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein shows high tyrosine kinase activity and deregulates signal transduction pathways involved normally in both apoptosis and proliferation. This aberrant activity is affected by signal transduction inhibitors (STIs), which block or prevent the oncogenic pathway. In this review, we present a closer look at our understanding of both the reversible transcriptional repression controlled by HDAC and the deregulated Bcr-Abl signal transduction. In addition, the application of low molecular weight drugs for human leukemia treatment based in this knowledge results in durable clinical remission and acceptable risk of toxic effects that should increase the cure rate. We hope that this review will provide timely information to the readers.","['Martinez-Mancilla, M', 'Zafra, G', 'Reynoso-Gomez, E', 'Martinez-Avalos, A', 'Rivera-Luna, R', 'Gariglio, P']","['Martinez-Mancilla M', 'Zafra G', 'Reynoso-Gomez E', 'Martinez-Avalos A', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Gariglio P']","['Depto de Genetica y Biologia Molecular, CINVESTAV-IPN, Av.

The WT1 transcript assay can be applied to almost all patients with leukemia regardless of the presence or absence of chimeric DNA markers. Furthermore, because of the fact that WT1 expression levels increase significantly at relapse compared with those at the time of diagnosis, and because of the decrease in background levels of WT1 expression in bone marrow following allogeneic SCT, the WT1 transcript assay possesses a high degree of sensitivity following allogeneic SCT. Frequent monitoring of the WT1 gene expression level predicts the risk of relapse following allogeneic SCT, and furthermore, the kinetics of WT1 transcripts predict the efficacy of immunomodulation therapy such as donor leukocyte infusion.","['Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Tamaki, Hiroya']","['Ogawa H', 'Ikegame K', 'Kawakami M', 'Tamaki H']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita City, Japan. ogawah@imed2.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', '*Transplantation', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",52,2004/06/30 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001687503 [doi]', 'K4UCN1RQT51C3MG7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Sep;45(9):1747-53. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001687503.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its functions are mediated by specific receptors on the surface of responsive cells and, upon ligand binding, several cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are activated. The cytoplasmic region proximal to the membrane of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) transduces proliferative and survival signals, whereas the distal carboxy-terminal region transduces maturation signals and suppresses the receptor's proliferative signals. Mutations in the G-CSF-R gene resulting in truncation of the carboxy-terminal region have been detected in a subset of patients with severe congenital neutropenia who developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In addition, the AML1-ETO fusion protein, expressed in leukemic cells harboring the t(8;21), disrupt the physiological function of transcription factors such as C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon, which in turn deregulate G-CSF-R expression. The resulting high levels of G-CSF-R and G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation may be associated with pathogenesis of AML with t(8;21). Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that G-CSF may act as a co-stimulus augmenting the response of PML-RARalpha acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to all-trans-retinoic acid treatment. Finally, in the PLZF-RARalpha acute promyelocytic leukemia transgenic model, G-CSF deficiency suppressed leukemia development. Altogether, these data suggest that the G-CSF signaling pathway may play a role in leukemogenesis.","['de Figueiredo, Lorena Lobo', 'de Abreu e Lima, Rodrigo Siqueira', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes']","['de Figueiredo LL', 'de Abreu e Lima RS', 'Rego EM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

However, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) or polyclonal DLI can limit the efficacy of these interventions. This toxicity can be avoided by using autologous T cells and/or tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). To generate antigen-specific T cells that can be derived from the allogeneic donor or the patient, we have genetically manipulated T cells to express a CD19-specific chimeric immunoreceptor.

The most abundant cellular GSL is LacCer. An elevation in the LacCer level occurs twice during the maturation process: initially, on formation of azurophil granules, and subsequently, (a more significant rise) on formation of specific granules. The formation of the latter is accompanied by an increase in the level of GalGalCer. During the maturation of myeloblasts, there is a simultaneous growth in the content of LacCer and GM3 as well as that of their common precursors, that is, free ceramides. Like other tumor cells, GM3 rich myeloblasts in the peripheral blood from patients with AML are characterized by shedding of gangliosides. The quantitative Cer/GlcCer ratio in these cells seems to be advantageous for the efficacy of chemotherapy in the induction of apoptosis. Myelo- and metamyelocytes achieve the highest level of GSLs. Their entry into the full maturity stage is accompanied by a decrease in the level of GSLs. Patterns of GSLs expression change greatly during development and maturation. However, with respect to the composition and content of GSLs, there are no significant differences between normal and leukemic mature neutrophils. At each stage of the development and maturation of myelogenous leukemic cells, as well as in normal mature neutrophils, there occurs the synthesis of the same molecular species both free ceramides and ceramide portions of LacCer, precursor of more complex GSLs.","['Smolenska-Sym, Gabriela', 'Spychalska, Justyna', 'Zdebska, Ewa', 'Wozniak, Jolanta', 'Traczyk, Zdzislawa', 'Pszenna, Ewa', 'Maj, Stanislaw', 'Danikiewicz, Witold', 'Bienkowski, Tomasz', 'Koscielak, Jerzy']","['Smolenska-Sym G', 'Spychalska J', 'Zdebska E', 'Wozniak J', 'Traczyk Z', 'Pszenna E', 'Maj S', 'Danikiewicz W', 'Bienkowski T', 'Koscielak J']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion Warsaw, Poland. gabsym@ihit.waw.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Lactosylceramides)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Ceramides/analysis/*isolation & purification', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lactosylceramides/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/chemistry/cytology', 'Plasma/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",,2004/06/30 05:00,2005/01/20 09:00,['2004/06/30 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.04.002 [doi]', 'S1079979604000907 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2004 Jul-Aug;33(1):68-76. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2004.04.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(4;11) translocation is one of the most frequent MLL translocations known today. In general, MLL translocations are the result of an illegitimate recombination process leading to reciprocal fusions of unrelated translocation partner (TP) genes with the MLL gene. Owing to the constant presence of the derivative (11) product, it was hypothesised that only MLL.TP fusion genes are responsible for the leukemogenic process. This concept has been successfully tested for some known MLL fusions, while other MLL fusions failed. Here, we demonstrate growth-transforming potential of AF4 wild-type and the AF4.MLL fusion protein. The underlying oncogenic mechanism involves the two E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2, the N-terminal portion of AF4 and the protection of the AF4.MLL fusion protein against proteosomal degradation.","['Bursen, Adelheid', 'Moritz, Sven', 'Gaussmann, Anne', 'Moritz, Soren', 'Dingermann, Theo', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Bursen A', 'Moritz S', 'Gaussmann A', 'Moritz S', 'Dingermann T', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Biocenter N230, University of Frankfurt/Main, Marie-Curie-Str. 9, Frankfurt/Main D-60439, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Aff1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (seven in absentia proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2004/06/29 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/29 05:00'],"['2004/06/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207837 [doi]', '1207837 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Aug 19;23(37):6237-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207837.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cure remains elusive, particularly in fludarabine-refractory patients, whose prognosis remains poor. Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been explored for such patients, lengthening the time to treatment failure in selected patients, but there is little hope that it will improve the cure rate. The strategy is particularly ineffective in patients with poor biological prognostic factors, such as abnormal cytogenetics and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region. Allogeneic SCT remains the only curative approach, producing an extended disease-free survival in 25-60%, mainly via the graft-versus-leukemia effect. The treatment-related mortality with such an approach has been significant, however, with a 30-40% risk of death within 100 days of the transplant. Nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens may produce high response rates and lower morbidity, especially for patients with chemosensitive disease.

The expanding knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer has shown that significant differences in gene expression patterns can guide therapy not only for neoplastic conditions, but also for a variety of diseases including inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative processes. As a result, the fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have emerged as potential new testing platforms for the individualized management of patients. An individual's response to a drug is the complex interaction of both genetic and non-genetic factors. Genetic variants in the drug target itself, disease pathway genes, or drug metabolizing enzymes may all be used as predictors of drug efficacy or toxicity. In oncology, the SNP technology has focused on detecting the predisposition for cancer, predicting of toxic responses to drugs and selecting the best individual and combinations of anti-cancer drugs. Pharmacogenomics involves the application of whole genome technologies (e.g., gene and protein expression data) for the prediction of the sensitivity or resistance of an individual's disease to a single or group of drugs. Genomic microarrays and transcriptional profiling have the ability to generate hundreds of thousands of data points requiring sophisticated and complex information systems necessary for accurate and useful data analysis.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae three-hybrid assay was used to directly examine the interaction between MMLV Gag and Psi. In this system, MMLV RNA regions exhibiting high-affinity Gag binding were mapped. All Gag-binding regions were located 3' to the viral splice donor sequence of the viral RNA transcript. No single short RNA sequence within Psi supported strong Gag interaction. Instead, an RNA comprised of nearly the entire Psi region was necessary to demonstrate an appreciable Gag interaction in the yeast three-hybrid system.

However, information on the incidence of cancer is lacking for this group. The purpose of this study is to report cancer incidence patterns for the U.S. AI/AN population. METHODS: Age-adjusted annual cancer incidence rates for 1992 through 1999 were calculated for 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) areas, representing a sample (42%) of the U.S. AI/AN population. Trends in cancer incidence rates for the AI/AN sample were determined using standard linear regression of log-transformed rates and were compared to those of the U.S. white population. RESULTS: The top five incident cancers (from highest to lowest) among AI/AN males were prostate, lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, kidney and renal pelvis, and stomach cancers. Among AI/AN women, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, lung and bronchus, endometrium, and ovary ranked highest. Four sites where cancer incidence rates are greater for AI/ANs than for whites include gallbladder (the AI/AN rate was 4.1 times the rate for white males and 2.6 times the rate for white females), liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancers (1.3 times for males and 2.3 times for females), stomach (1.2 times for males and 1.5 times for females), and kidney and renal pelvis (1.03 times for males and 1.07 times for females). The data show increasing trends for AI/AN males and females and declining trends for white males and females for colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers and leukemia. Similar differences between AI/AN rates and white rates were found for urinary bladder cancers in males and gallbladder cancer in females. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of SEER data allowed for the determination of disparities in cancer incidence between a sample of the U.S. AI/AN population and the white population. The findings of this study provide baseline information necessary for developing cancer prevention and intervention strategies specific to the AI/AN population to address these cancer disparities.","['Paltoo, Dina N', 'Chu, Kenneth C']","['Paltoo DN', 'Chu KC']","['Cancer Prevention Studies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. paltood@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Public Health Rep,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",9716844,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Alaska/epidemiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/ethnology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/ethnology', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/ethnology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indians, North American/*statistics & numerical data', 'Inuits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Kidney Neoplasms/ethnology', 'Linear Models', 'Lung Neoplasms/ethnology', 'Male', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology/prevention & control', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/ethnology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/ethnology', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'Stomach Neoplasms/ethnology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",,2004/06/29 05:00,2004/07/31 05:00,['2004/06/29 05:00'],"['2004/06/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.phr.2004.05.009 [doi]', 'S0033354904001013 [pii]']",ppublish,Public Health Rep. 2004 Jul-Aug;119(4):443-51. doi: 10.1016/j.phr.2004.05.009.,,,,,,,,,PMC1497649,,,,,,,,,

In this study, choroid plexus and other components of the CSF circulatory system were investigated by Western blotting, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry for production of interleukin-6-related cytokines characterized by neuroactivity [cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M] and signaling through the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-beta receptor heterodimer. Western blot analysis showed that CT-1 was the only cytokine family member detectable in adult rat choroid plexus, as in leptomeninges. The specificity of detection was verified with blots of the same tissues from CT-1-deficient mice. Levels of both CT-1 mRNA and protein were constitutively high in rat from birth through adulthood in choroid plexus, up-regulated postnatally in leptomeninges and undetectable in brain parenchyma. Using antigen retrieval, CT-1 immunolocalized to choroid epithelial cells in all choroid plexuses in addition to leptomeninges (arachnoid and pial-glial membranes). Ependymal cells lining the ventricular neuroaxis, unlike the central canal, were also CT-1-immunoreactive. Western blots indicated rat choroid epithelial cells express and release CT-1 immunoreactivity under defined culture conditions and also revealed the presence of a CT-1-like protein in human choroid plexus and CSF. Previously, CT-1 has been conceptualized to function as a target-derived factor for PNS neurons. Our study clearly demonstrates production of CT-1 in the postnatal and adult CNS, specifically by cell types comprising the blood-CSF barrier, and its accumulation in ventricular ependyma. This finding has broad implications for CT-1 functioning apart from other leukemia inhibitory factor receptor ligands as a CSF-borne signal of brain homeostasis, one possibly involving regulation of the barrier itself, the ependyma or target cells in the surrounding parenchyma, including the subventricular zone. A rationale for studies examining CT-1-deficient mice in these respects is provided by the data.","['Gard, A L', 'Gavin, E', 'Solodushko, V', 'Pennica, D']","['Gard AL', 'Gavin E', 'Solodushko V', 'Pennica D']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, 2038 Medical Sciences Building, University of South Alabama College of Medicine, Mobile, AL 36688-0002, USA. agard@jaguar1.usouthal.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Arachnoid/cytology/metabolism', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Ventricles/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Choroid Plexus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Ependyma/cytology/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pia Mater/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats']",,2004/06/29 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/06/29 05:00'],"['2004/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.03.065 [doi]', 'S0306452204002623 [pii]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2004;127(1):43-52. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.03.065.,,,,,['AG19603/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, a persistent reduction in gas transfer 1 yr after allogeneic BMT with busulphan and cyclophosphamide conditioning was reported by the current authors. In the present study this reduction was examined to see if it was permanent, transient or progressive. Prospectively, 43 consecutive adult patients with malignant blood disorders undertook lung function measurements prior to BMT, at 3 month intervals during the 1st yr after BMT and finally after 5 yrs. Mean baseline lung function values were >90% predicted. Within the 1st yr after BMT a transient decline in lung volumes and a persistent reduction in gas transfer were observed. After 5 yrs, baseline values were restored for all variables, except in four patients who developed obliterative bronchiolitis. Acute leukaemia and smoking were independently associated with gas transfer reductions at baseline and during the 1st yr after BMT. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with busulphan and cyclophosphamide conditioning was associated with a reduction in gas transfer 1 yr after bone marrow transplantation but baseline values were usually restored after 5 yrs. Since recovery may be gradual and slow, an observation period >1 yr is required before drawing conclusions concerning the development of a permanent reduction in lung function after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation conditioned with busulphan and cyclophosphamide.","['Lund, M B', 'Brinch, L', 'Kongerud, J', 'Boe, J']","['Lund MB', 'Brinch L', 'Kongerud J', 'Boe J']","['Dept of Respiratory Medicine, Division of Heart and Lung Diseases, The National Hospital, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange/*drug effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Respiratory Mechanics/*drug effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2004/06/29 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/06/29 05:00'],"['2004/06/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1183/09031936.04.00084804 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Respir J. 2004 Jun;23(6):901-5. doi: 10.1183/09031936.04.00084804.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic study was carried out to evaluate its antitumour efficacy against B16 murine melanoma. Antiinflammatory and analgesic activities of MPTQ were also studied. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of MPTQ on HL-60, B16F10 and neuro 2a cells was estimated by trypan blue exclusion test. The antitumour activity was evaluated using single dose, multiple/daily injections (days 3-6) or intermittent treatments over two weeks against s.c. implanted B16melanoma, both in terms of increased life span and tumour growth inhibition. Antiinflammatory activity was seen on carrageenan induced hind paw oedema. Counting the number of abdominal constrictions after the injection of acetic acid assessed the analgesic response. RESULTS: MPTQ is cytotoxic to all the cell lines tested and ID50 being in the range of 0.08-1.0 microM. MPTQ was studied for anticancer activity in the clonogenic assay. Drug was applied over a wide dose range by 24 h exposure, yielding clear dose-response effects. In vivo antitumour efficacy against B16 melanoma showed evidence of major antitumour activity for MPTQ. Single and multiple i.p. doses of drug proved high level activity against the s.c. grafted B16melanoma, significantly increasing survival (P<0.001) and inhibiting tumour growth (T/C of 3.0%). A reduction (76.48%) in paw volume was noted in 40 mg/kg dose of which was comparable to antiinflammatory activity of 150 mg/kg i.p. of phenylbutazone. Analgesic activity was found to be of peripheral type as there was reduction of 74 per cent in writhing response by MPTQ in dose of 40 mg/kg in mice. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the compounds containing pyrimidothienoquinoline system particularly 8-methoxy derivative might be potentially useful antitumour agent. We conclude that the correlation of physicochemical properties of the new series of pyrimidothienoquinolines with their pharmacological properties, might help in trying to understand the mechanism of pyrimidothienoquinolines series.","['Gopal, M', 'Shahabuddin, M S']","['Gopal M', 'Shahabuddin MS']","['Department of Studies & Research in Biochemistry, Kuvempu University, Davanagere, Karnataka, India. muttagigopal@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (8-methoxypyrimido(4(1),5(1)-4,5)thieno(2,3-b)quinoline-4(3H)-one)', '0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)']",IM,"['Analgesics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Quinolines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Thiophenes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/29 05:00,2004/08/10 05:00,['2004/06/29 05:00'],"['2004/06/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2004 May;119(5):198-205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients with follicular lymphoma respond to therapy, and the average survival time in large series is approximately 10 years. Patients who achieve a complete remission with initial treatment have an approximately 25% chance of remaining free of disease for 10 years. However, this means that more than 80% of patients will require salvage therapy. Cladribine is a newer purine analogue and is of particular interest because it is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase. It is cytotoxic to both proliferating and resting lymphocytes, making it an attractive agent for the treatment of indolent NHL. In this review article, we summarize the current treatment approaches for indolent NHL and the results of cladribine monotherapy studies in Japan and cladribine studies in Germany that have focused on a combination therapy with mitoxantrone. Cladribine is a potent inhibitor of DNA repair. The combination of a DNA-damaging agent with an inhibitor of DNA repair constitutes the rationale for combining cladribine with mitoxantrone. A German study has demonstrated that the combination of reduced-dose cladribine and mitoxantrone is a highly active regimen with favorable toxicity profiles. Cladribine is highly effective as a single agent and in combination with mitoxantrone in the treatment of indolent NHL, and its availability broadens the range of therapeutic options for indolent NHL.","['Armitage, James O', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Rummel, Mathias J']","['Armitage JO', 'Tobinai K', 'Hoelzer D', 'Rummel MJ']","['Section of Oncology/Hematology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Treatment Outcome']",74,2004/06/29 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/06/29 05:00'],"['2004/06/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.04050 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 May;79(4):311-21. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.04050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although more resistant to chemotherapy than acute lymphoblastic leukemia, its responsiveness and survival rates have considerably improved during the last 15 years by virtue of intensification of chemotherapy and due to the better supportive care. Relapses still remain the main cause of treatment failure. Management of children with AML was unified in the Czech Republic in 1993 according to AML-BFM 93 Study protocol. METHODS AND RESULTS: Treatment results were evaluated in 61 patients, of whom 45 (73.8%) achieved complete remission. Five-year event-free-survival (EFS) was found in 42.3%, and overall survival was 45.3%. Prognosis of the standard-risk patients was significantly better than in the high-risk group (EFS 62.5% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.03). The most important prognostic factor was the early treatment response. Compared to chemotherapy, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation did not significantly improve the outcome of high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment results of children with AML in the Czech Republic are comparable to those achieved by leading leukemia study groups in the world. The aim of the next study is to increase the complete-remission rate by reducing early deaths.","['Stary, J', 'Gajdos, P', 'Blazek, B', 'Ptoszkova, H', 'Hrstkova, H', 'Kopecna, L', 'Tousovska, K', 'Hak, J', 'Prochazkova, D', 'Cerna, Z', 'Jabali, Y', 'Timr, P', 'Vavra, V', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Smisek, P', 'Hrusak, O', 'Michalova, K']","['Stary J', 'Gajdos P', 'Blazek B', 'Ptoszkova H', 'Hrstkova H', 'Kopecna L', 'Tousovska K', 'Hak J', 'Prochazkova D', 'Cerna Z', 'Jabali Y', 'Timr P', 'Vavra V', 'Sedlacek P', 'Smisek P', 'Hrusak O', 'Michalova K']","['II. detska klinika 2.

Serum parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM were investigated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the virus DNA was sought in bone marrow cells by a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected in 11 of the 50 (22%) ALL children with anemia, 4 of whom were also IgM positive. In addition, IgM positivity was observed in nine (18%) other children who were negative for parvovirus B19 DNA. The children without anemia were found to be significantly different than those with anemia in terms of parvovirus B19 DNA positivity and DNA + IgM positivity (P = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). IgG was found to be positive in a total of 19 (38%) cases, with B19 DNA present in 6 of them. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the high frequency of parvovirus B19 in anemia in children with ALL and the importance of testing for its DNA in the bone marrow cells together with IgG and IgM antibodies in the serum of immunocompromised patients. It is important to consider parvovirus B19 infections as a cause of anemia and suppressed erythropoiesis in children with ALL who are receiving ongoing treatment.","['El-Mahallawy, Hadir Ahmed', 'Mansour, Tarek', 'El-Din, Sahar Ezz', 'Hafez, Mohamed', 'Abd-el-Latif, Soheir']","['El-Mahallawy HA', 'Mansour T', 'El-Din SE', 'Hafez M', 'Abd-el-Latif S']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt. hadir38@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Anemia/*etiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Child', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Parvoviridae Infections/blood/*complications/immunology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2004/06/26 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2004/06/26 05:00'],"['2004/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200407000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/00043426-200407000-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Jul;26(7):403-6. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200407000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, it was observed that Tax upregulated the expression of human interleukin 17 (IL17), a cytokine mainly produced by activated CD4(+) memory T cells. Indeed, IL17 mRNA was highly expressed in HTLV-1-infected T cells as well as in Tax-expressing Jurkat T cells, whereas it was not detectable in HTLV-1-negative T cell lines. The clinical relevance of these observations was further demonstrated by quantitative assessment of IL17 expression in lymphocytes isolated from one HTLV-1-infected patient. To define the transcriptional activation of the IL17 gene by Tax, the 5'-flanking region of this gene was cloned and a reporter gene analysis performed. The presence of a Tax-responsive region spanning 614 bp upstream of the initiation start site was identified, in HeLa as well as in Jurkat cells, stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and Ca(2+) ionophore. Finally, Tax mutants were used to show that the transcriptional activation of the IL17 promoter by Tax was dependent on the CREB/ATF pathway. As IL17 upregulates the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, these observations provide new insights into the involvement of the Tax protein in the pathophysiology of HTLV-1-associated inflammatory disorders.","['Dodon, Madeleine Duc', 'Li, Zhenlin', 'Hamaia, Samir', 'Gazzolo, Louis']","['Dodon MD', 'Li Z', 'Hamaia S', 'Gazzolo L']","[""Virologie Humaine INSERM-U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, IFR 128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, 46 allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France."", 'Biologie Moleculaire de la Differenciation, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot, 2 place Jussieu, case 7136, 75251 Paris Cedex 05, France.', ""Virologie Humaine INSERM-U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, IFR 128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, 46 allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France."", ""Virologie Humaine INSERM-U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, IFR 128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, 46 allee d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J6K4F9V3BA (Cadmium Chloride)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cadmium Chloride/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-17/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics/immunology']",,2004/06/26 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2004/06/26 05:00'],"['2004/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.79921-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2004 Jul;85(Pt 7):1921-1932. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.79921-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.79921-0 [doi],,

We observed that the Mcl-1 protein is widely expressed in human sarcoma cell lines of different histological origin (n = 7). Because the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can significantly contribute to the chemoresistance of human malignancies, we used an antisense strategy to address this issue in sarcoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SCID mice (n = 6/group) received s.c. injections of SW872 liposarcoma cells. After development of palpable tumors, mice were treated by s.c.-implanted miniosmotic pumps prefilled with saline or antisense or universal control oligonucleotides (20 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks). On days 2, 6, and 10, mice were treated with low-dose cyclophosphamide (35 mg/kg i.p) or saline control. During the experiments, tumor weight was assessed twice weekly by caliper measurements. On day 14, animals were sacrificed. Tumors were weighed and fixed in formalin for immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling analysis. RESULTS: Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides specifically reduced Mcl-1 protein expression but produced no reduction in tumor weight compared with saline-treated control animals. Cyclophosphamide monotreatment caused only modest tumor weight reduction compared with saline control. However, use of Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides combined with cyclophosphamide clearly enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and significantly reduced tumor weight by more than two-thirds compared with respective control treatments. CONCLUSION: A combination of Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides with low-dose cyclophosphamide provides a synergistic antitumor effect and might qualify as a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance in human sarcoma.","['Thallinger, Christiane', 'Wolschek, Markus F', 'Maierhofer, Helmut', 'Skvara, Hans', 'Pehamberger, Hubert', 'Monia, Brett P', 'Jansen, Burkhard', 'Wacheck, Volker', 'Selzer, Edgar']","['Thallinger C', 'Wolschek MF', 'Maierhofer H', 'Skvara H', 'Pehamberger H', 'Monia BP', 'Jansen B', 'Wacheck V', 'Selzer E']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Section of Experimental Oncology/Molecular Pharmacology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2004/06/26 05:00,2005/01/04 09:00,['2004/06/26 05:00'],"['2004/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0774 [doi]', '10/12/4185 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 15;10(12 Pt 1):4185-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0774.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we dissect the detailed signaling pathway involved in resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Our data showed that treatment with resveratrol-induced activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, in turn, activated the downstream kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Transfection with a dominant-negative c-Jun N-terminal kinase expression vector reduced FasL expression and DNA fragmentation induced by resveratrol. However, inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity by treatment with SB203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase specific inhibitor) or expression of mutant p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase expression vector did not alter the apoptosis and FasL expression in response to resveratrol. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 signaling inhibited not only the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but also the expression of FasL and apoptosis. Similarly, over-expression of wild-type apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 strengthened the resveratrol-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, FasL expression and subsequent apoptosis. These results suggest the possible involvement of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling in the regulation of FasL expression and subsequent apoptosis induced by resveratrol in HL-60 cells. Resveratrol also activated the small GTP-binding protein Cdc42, rather than other members such as RhoA or Rac1. Expression of a mutant Cdc42 (N17 Cdc42) dramatically reduced resveratrol-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity, FasL expression and apoptotic cell death. These results showed that resveratrol induced apoptosis through the Cdc42/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase/FasL signaling cascade in HL-60 cells.","['Su, Jen-Liang', 'Lin, Ming-Tsan', 'Hong, Chih-Chen', 'Chang, Cheng-Chi', 'Shiah, Shine-Gwo', 'Wu, Cheng-Wen', 'Chen, Szu-Ta', 'Chau, Yat-Pang', 'Kuo, Min-Liang']","['Su JL', 'Lin MT', 'Hong CC', 'Chang CC', 'Shiah SG', 'Wu CW', 'Chen ST', 'Chau YP', 'Kuo ML']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/drug effects/*metabolism']",,2004/06/26 05:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/06/26 05:00'],"['2004/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgh220 [doi]', 'bgh220 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2005 Jan;26(1):1-10. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgh220.

In conclusion, we found that the presence of the t(12;21) translocation in childhood precursor B-ALL is associated with a high tumor cell sensitivity to doxorubicin and etoposide. High throughput techniques should now be used to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion is linked to increased sensitivity to these drugs.","['Frost, Britt-Marie', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Gustafsson, Goran', 'Nygren, Peter', 'Hellebostad, Marit', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar']","['Frost BM', 'Forestier E', 'Gustafsson G', 'Nygren P', 'Hellebostad M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Kanerva J', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Larsson R', 'Lonnerholm G']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden. britt-marie.frost@kbh.uu.se""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Diploidy', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2004/06/26 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/26 05:00'],"['2004/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4426 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43308-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 15;104(8):2452-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4426.

Using murine embryonic fibroblast cell lines as a model (Mcl-1(wt/wt) and Mcl-1(Delta/null) MEFs), we here demonstrate that deletion of Mcl-1 reduces fetal bovine serum (FBS)-, VEGF-, and IL-6-induced proliferation. We also show that VEGF up-regulates Mcl-1 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in 3 human MM cell lines and MM patient cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the pan-VEGF inhibitor, GW654652, inhibits VEGF-induced up-regulation of Mcl-1 and, as with Mcl-1 siRNA, is associated with decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Finally, we show that VEGF protects MM patient cells against FBS starvation-induced apoptosis.

Three-dimensional modeling of human MDR1/P-gp indicates that these glycoproteins function as efficient, ATP-dependent gate-keepers, which scan the plasma membrane and its inner leaflet to flip lipophilic substrates to the outer membrane leaflet. Delineation of the adverse prognostic power of MDR1 in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) raised hopes that pharmacologic blockade of P-gp would improve the outcome of conventional cytotoxic therapy, perhaps more so than in any other human malignancy. Phase 3 clinical trials investigating first- and second-generation P-gp antagonists have yielded conflicting results, emphasizing the importance of applying preclinical principals to realistically appraise expectations for clinical benefit. Structure-based design strategies and the delineation of transcriptional regulators of survival gene cassettes promise to yield novel, more-effective strategies to overcome drug resistance.

The French experience and review of the literature.,294-9,"Systemic mastocytosis (SM) are defined by an abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in bone marrow and/or other extracutaneous organs. There is currently no cure for this disease. Because of similarities and/or association of mastocytosis with myeloproliferative disorders, interferon alpha has been tested but with contradictory reported results. A first prospective multicenter phase II trial was then started in France. From 1994 to 1997, 20 adult patients with confirmed bone marrow involvement received interferon alpha-2b for at least 6 months, (from 1 million U per day up to 5 million U/m(2)/day). Thirteen patients who presented systemic and/or specific cutaneous manifestations, demonstrated objective responses: seven (35%) were partial, six (30%) minor but no complete response could be observed at the time of analysis. The bone marrow remained unchanged in 12/13.

The major risk at diagnosis, in the absence of treatment, is essentially thrombosis. Different therapeutic trials have shown the necessity to maintain circulating blood cells (RBC and platelets counts) near normal levels to avoid thrombosis. Phlebotomies alone in PV lead in the long run to metaplasia and increased platelet counts and should only be kept for emergency cell count reduction. Myelosuppression is thus until recently the most widely accepted effective alternative. However, the effects of long term chronic administration of myelosuppresive agents needs to be analyzed and monitored as the biological changes which appear during the course of these diseases linked or not to the intrinsic clonal haematopoietic abnormality may lead to malignant transformation. Thus, alternative therapies need to be evaluated and predisposition factors taken in account.","['Chomienne, Christine', 'Rain, Jean Didier', 'Briere, Jean']","['Chomienne C', 'Rain JD', 'Briere J']","['Service de Medecine Nucleaire, Unite de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Louis, 1, avenue Claude Vellefaux, Paris 75010, France. christine.chomienne@sls-ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,,IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Platelet Count', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*complications']",49,2004/06/26 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/06/26 05:00'],"['2004/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.patbio.2004.03.017 [doi]', 'S0369811404000951 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 2004 Jun;52(5):289-93. doi: 10.1016/j.patbio.2004.03.017.,,,,,,['French PV and ET Study Groups'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decade, nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have been designed to reduce toxicity and allow stem cell transplantation in elderly and medically infirm patients. These are relatively nontoxic and tolerable regimens designed not to maximally eradicate the malignancy, but rather to provide sufficient immune suppression to achieve engraftment and to allow induction of graft-versus-leukemia effect as the primary treatment. After transplantation, immune interventions are often required to hasten this graft-versus-leukemia effect.

The options for consolidation therapy include repeated cycles of high-dose cytosine arabinoside-based chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Chemotherapy alone is associated with the highest risk of relapse, but it has the lowest treatment-related mortality (TRM). Allogeneic SCT has the lowest risk of relapse with the highest TRM, whereas autologous SCT has an intermediate risk of relapse and TRM. Cytogenetic status of patients with AML is the single most important prognostic factor. However, it is increasingly recognized that this factor alone is inadequate for risk stratification. Based on cytogenetic stratification, a good-risk group of patients in first complete remission (CR1) would benefit most from high-dose consolidation chemotherapy. The risks of a SCT outweigh the benefit in this group. In the unfavorable-risk group, an allogeneic sibling SCT in CR1 would be acceptable, whereas the outcomes with chemotherapy alone or with an autologous SCT are dismal. Based on minimal data, a matched-unrelated donor SCT for this group of patients should be recommended. In the intermediate-risk group, strategies are evolving and the use of additional prognosticators will help in decision making. Autologous or allogeneic sibling SCT is a reasonable option in a subset of patients within this group at a high risk of relapse.

Molecular genetic and immunophenotypic studies are allowing more precise characterization of CLL and defining important biologic markers that predict clinical behavior. Prolymphocytic leukemia is now more narrowly defined and its relationship to nucleolated variants of MCL is now apparent. With new reagents and techniques applied to problems such as identification of Sezary cells and T-cell monoclonality determination, our ability to diagnose, monitor, and provide prognostic information is improving.

The initial descriptions of the various subtypes of AML, established by the FAB classification, were based on morphology and cytochemical stains. Although morphology remains the foundation for the diagnosis, additional diagnostic studies including immunophenotyping, cytogenetic evaluation, and molecular genetic studies have become critical, and in some specific cases, mandatory, complementary tools. Several specific subtypes of AML are now treated with directed or targeted therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is currently the only example of a subtype of AML to which specific therapy targeted to a molecular genetic abnormality is available and this subtype now is highly curable. Future studies will address newly identified prognostic factors and gene mutations such as FLT3, Wilm's tumor (WTI), and CEBPA which will enable the further pathologic classification of patients with AML.

Six days after completing a 4-week induction therapy containing 9 doses of L-asparaginase, severe left abdominal pain developed. Abdominal computed tomography showed phlegmon formation anterior to the pancreatic head and in the left posterior pararenal space. The strands of inflammatory soft tissues encased the upper third of the left ureter, causing left hydroureter and left hydronephrosis. The ureteral obstruction resolved after insertion of a double-J catheter that remained in place for 66 days.

Selective inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by imatinib has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of CML, particularly in chronic phase. Some patients, however, primarily those with advanced disease, are either refractory to imatinib or eventually relapse. Relapse with imatinib frequently depends not only on re-emergence of BCR-ABL kinase activity but may also indicate BCR-ABL-independent disease progression not amenable to imatinib inhibition. Results from phase 2/3 trials suggest that rates of resistance and relapse correlate with the stage of disease and with the monitoring parameters--hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response. These observations and more recent trials with imatinib, combined with insights provided by an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance, have established the rationale for strategies to avoid and overcome imatinib resistance in the management of CML patients. To prevent resistance, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with appropriate initial dosing is essential. Management of resistance may include therapeutic strategies such as dose escalation to achieve individual optimal levels, combination therapy, as well as treatment interruption.","['Hochhaus, A', 'La Rosee, P']","['Hochhaus A', 'La Rosee P']","['III Medizinische Klinik, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany. hochhaus@uni-hd.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",109,2004/06/25 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/25 05:00'],"['2004/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403426 [doi]', '2403426 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1321-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403426.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Markers of bone resorption (NTX, TRACP-5b), bone formation (bone-alkaline phosphatase (bALP), osteocalcin), OPG and sRANKL were measured pre- and every month post-ASCT.

All patients received bisphosphonates both pre- and post-ASCT. At baseline the majority of patients had increased NTX, TRACP-5b levels, and sRANKL/OPG ratio, while markers of bone formation were strongly suppressed. ASCT produced a significant reduction of sRANKL/OPG ratio, with a concomitant decrease of NTX, and TRACP-5b levels, starting the second month post-ASCT. Bone formation markers, osteocalcin and bALP, started to increase after the 9th and 11th month post-ASCT, respectively, while the increase of OPG preceded this.

Leukemic cells were studied from 29 patients suffering either from acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (AML or CML), acute or chronic lymphoid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An average of 49 vs 5% of specific cell killing was found when using perforin vs anti-FAS antibodies, respectively. Interestingly, resistance towards both perforin and anti-FAS antibodies was found exclusively in leukemic cells from patients with myeloid leukemia. Analysis of leukemic cells from patients with CML, suffering from leukemia relapse after HSCT and given donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to induce remission, indicated that the effectiveness of treatment with DLI was not associated with sensitivity of leukemic cells to perforin. In conclusion, resistance towards anti-FAS antibodies is a common phenomenon in leukemia/lymphoma, whereas perforin resistance occurs only in myeloid leukemia.

The aim of this study is to evaluate his epidemiological approach for his investigation on the effects of benzene and to bring attention to the benzene problem in Turkey. Dr. Aksoy observed that a large group of leukemic patients were shoemakers, or they worked in leather manufacturing. In the 1960s, benzene was a popular solvent in the leather industry. Dr. Aksoy conducted a field investigation in Gedikpasa- Istanbul, where the shoemakers worked so that he could draw his key observations from actual environmental conditions. With a gas detector, he found the concentration of benzene in these work places to be 150-210 ppm and up to 650 ppm on rare occasions. He performed an epidemiological study and health education among 28,500 shoe, slipper and handbag workers during the period from 1967 to 1974. He published these data, establishing an association between benzene and leukemia. The incidence of leukemia among the shoe workers was decreased by screening, health education, and legislative actions in Turkey, but it began to increase again because of lack of an occupational health policy and underestimation of the problem.

It was determined that this cell line has a heterozygous mutation in exon 5 of Trp53. Based on this assumption that the cell line is heterozygous for the Trp53 gene, it was postulated that the small colony thymidine kinase (Tk) mutant phenotype may be due to a newly induced mutation/deletion in both the Trp53 and Tk1 alleles. The resultant Tk-/- mutants would also be Trp53+/0 or Trp53+/+ and would lose their ability to grow at normal rates. Subsequently, we published our evaluation of the Trp53 status in L5178Y cells. This analysis included sequencing of Trp53 exon 4 and determined that the mouse lymphoma cell line has a mutation in both of the Trp53 alleles and, therefore, no wild-type Trp53 allele in either Tk+/- cells or Tk-/- mutants. Because the cells have no wild-type Trp53, it is not possible that the small colony phenotype results from a newly induced loss of both functional Trp53 and Tk. To determine whether small colonies might, however, include the deletion of both Trp53 and Tk we evaluated, using microsatellite marker analysis, a series of small colony mutants. We also utilized in situ hybridization to determine that the Trp53 alleles are, in fact, in their normal chromosome 11 location in Tk+/- 3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells. From all of these analyses we can conclude that the small colony mutant phenotype is not caused by deletion of both Trp53 and Tk1.","['Clark, L Scott', 'Harrington-Brock, Karen', 'Wang, Jianyong', 'Sargent, Linda', 'Lowry, David', 'Reynolds, Steve H', 'Moore, Martha M']","['Clark LS', 'Harrington-Brock K', 'Wang J', 'Sargent L', 'Lowry D', 'Reynolds SH', 'Moore MM']","['University of North Carolina Curriculum in Toxicology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Painting', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia L5178/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mice', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",,2004/06/25 05:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/06/25 05:00'],"['2004/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/geh024 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2004 Jul;19(4):263-8. doi: 10.1093/mutage/geh024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the neural stem cell niche of the mouse olfactory epithelium, we identified a combination of extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors that regulate adhesion and mitosis in non-neural stem cells [intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), beta1, beta4, and alpha-1, -3, and -6 integrins] and on horizontal basal cells (HBCs), candidate olfactory neuro-epithelial progenitors. Using ECM receptors as our guide, we recreated a defined microenvironment in vitro that mimics olfactory basal lamina and, when supplemented with epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor, allows us to preferentially expand multiple clonal adherent colony phenotypes from individual ICAM-1+ and ICAM-1+/beta1 integrin+-selected HBCs. The most highly mitotic colony-forming HBCs demonstrate multipotency, spontaneously generating more ICAM-positive presumptive HBCs, a combination of olfactory neuroglial progenitors, and neurons of olfactory and potentially nonolfactory phenotypes. HBCs thus possess a conserved adhesion receptor expression profile similar to non-neural stem cells, preferential self-replication in an in vitro environment mimicking their in vivo niche, and contain subpopulations of cells that can produce multiple differentiated neuronal and glial progeny from within and beyond the olfactory system in vitro.","['Carter, Lindsay A', 'MacDonald, Jessica L', 'Roskams, A Jane']","['Carter LA', 'MacDonald JL', 'Roskams AJ']","['Department of Zoology and Center for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia, V6T 1Z4 Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Integrins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mitosis', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'Olfactory Mucosa/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phenotype']",,2004/06/25 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/25 05:00'],"['2004/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0330-04.2004 [doi]', '24/25/5670 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2004 Jun 23;24(25):5670-83. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0330-04.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC6729216,,,,,,,,,

DNA-PK and Ki-67 protein content was investigated in tumour samples of lymphoid malignancies, obtained from patients with low- and high-grade lymphomas, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and multiple myeloma. All patients were untreated before sampling. Normal bone marrow, reactive tonsillar tissue and ordinary lymph node tissue were used as controls. We show here that lymphoid malignancies display differences in DNA-PK protein expression. Low-grade lymphoma, appearing as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) displayed a significantly lower frequency of cells staining positive for DNA-PKcs and Ku86, but surprisingly not for Ku70, compared with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. When material from individual CLL patients was investigated, cells from lymph nodes showed a higher frequency of positive cells with respect to all DNA-PK subunits, compared with CLL cells infiltrating the bone marrow. High-grade lymphoma lymph node samples showed an increased frequency of cells staining positive for DNA-PKcs, Ku86 and Ki-67 compared with lymph node samples from low-grade lymphoma patients. Again, no difference in the Ku70 levels between the two lymphoma entities was noted. In multiple myeloma, the frequency of cells with positive staining for DNA-PKcs was similar to that detected in ALL and high-grade lymphoma. We conclude that with the exception of multiple myeloma, expression of DNA-PK coincides with the degree of maturation of lymphoid malignancies. In low- and high-grade lymphoma, DNA-PK is associated with the proliferation rate.","['Holgersson, Asa', 'Erdal, Hamdiye', 'Nilsson, Anders', 'Lewensohn, Rolf', 'Kanter, Lena']","['Holgersson A', 'Erdal H', 'Nilsson A', 'Lewensohn R', 'Kanter L']","['Unit of Medical Radiation Biology, Karolinska Institutet, CCK, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Cell Count', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,2004/06/25 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/06/25 05:00'],"['2004/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexmp.2004.02.001 [doi]', 'S001448000400019X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2004 Aug;77(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2004.02.001.,,,"['Exp Mol Pathol. 2005 Aug;79(1):86.

The dermatological literature relating to CLL is sparse. A global descriptive survey of a large number of CLL patients has not previously been published. OBJECTIVES: To report the spectrum of dermatological conditions seen in a large series of CLL patients. METHODS: Skin complications in patients with established CLL were identified retrospectively from clinical and photographic records, principally a database of over 750 consecutive cases. These events were classified, enumerated and compared. RESULTS: Forty patients with 125 skin manifestations were identified and studied. Forty-one manifestations had documented clinical or histological atypia. In 21 of these 41 complications there had been no prior immunosuppressive therapy. We observed that cutaneous malignancies frequently presented atypically both clinically and histologically. There were 18 patients with 56 instances of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and clinical atypia was more common with SCC than with BCC. Other cutaneous findings included varicella zoster (n = 6), leukaemia cutis (n = 3), acute graft-versus-host disease (n = 5), cutaneous drug eruptions (n = 9), multiple warts (n = 3), herpes simplex (n = 3), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (n = 2), eosinophilic folliculitis (n = 2), malignant melanoma (n = 2) and Merkel cell tumour (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a range of dermatological conditions in CLL patients, with a tendency to atypical presentations. The atypia was independent of prior chemotherapy.","['Agnew, K L', 'Ruchlemer, R', 'Catovsky, D', 'Matutes, E', 'Bunker, C B']","['Agnew KL', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Catovsky D', 'Matutes E', 'Bunker CB']","['Department of Dermatology The Royal Marsden Hospital, London SW3 6JJ, U.K. karenagnew@lineone.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/complications', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/complications', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications', 'Chickenpox/complications', 'Drug Eruptions/complications', 'Female', 'Folliculitis/complications', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Herpes Simplex/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/complications', 'Male', 'Melanoma/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications', 'Warts/complications']",,2004/06/25 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/06/25 05:00'],"['2004/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.05982.x [doi]', 'BJD5982 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2004 Jun;150(6):1129-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.05982.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present evidence to show that EEN/EA2 is localized predominantly in nuclei of various cell lines of haemopoietic, fibroblast and epithelial origin, in contrast with its reported cytoplasmic localization in neurons and osteoclasts, and that EEN/EA2 exhibits nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. During the cell cycle, EEN/EA2 shows dynamic localization: it is perichromosomal in prometaphase, co-localizes with the bipolar spindle in metaphase and anaphase and redistributes to the midzone and midbody in telophase. This pattern of distribution coincides with changes in protein levels of EEN/EA2, with the highest levels being observed in G2/M-phase. Our results suggest that distinct subcellular localization of the endophilin A family members probably underpins their diverse cellular functions and indicates a role for EEN/EA2 in the cell cycle.","['Cheung, Ngai', 'So, Chi Wai', 'Yam, Judy W P', 'So, C K C', 'Poon, Randy Y C', 'Jin, Dong-Yan', 'Chan, Li Chong']","['Cheung N', 'So CW', 'Yam JW', 'So CK', 'Poon RY', 'Jin DY', 'Chan LC']","[""Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SH3GL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteins/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Subcellular Fractions/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,2004/06/25 05:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/06/25 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20040041 [doi]', 'BJ20040041 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Oct 1;383(Pt 1):27-35. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040041.,,,,,,,,,PMC1134040,,,,,,,,,

The complete nucleotide sequence (366 bp), named BOJU-III, encodes the BthA-I-PLA2 precursor, which includes a signal peptide and the mature protein with 16 and 122 amino acid residues, respectively. Multiple comparison of both the nucleotide and respective deduced amino acid sequence with EST and protein sequences from databases revealed that the full-length cDNA identified (BOJU III--AY145836) is related to an acidic PLA2 sharing similarity, within the range 55-81%, with acidic phospholipases from snake venoms. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of acidic PLA2s from several pit viper genera showed close evolutionary relationships among acidic PLA2s from Bothrops, Crotalus, and Trimeresurus. The molecular modeling showed structural similarity with other dimeric class II PLA2s from snake venoms. The native protein BthA-I-PLA2, a nontoxic acidic PLA2 directly isolated from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom, was purified and submitted to various bioassays. BthA-I-PLA2 displayed high catalytic activity and induced Ca2+-dependent liposome disruption. Edema induced by this PLA2 was inhibited by indomethacin and dexamethasone, thus suggesting involvement of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. BthA-I-PLA2 showed anticoagulant activity upon human plasma and inhibited phospholipid-dependent platelet aggregation induced by collagen or ADP.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the profile of cancer risks in EPWAs. DATA SOURCES AND ANALYSIS: Using AIDS data from 1981-1996, 8828 EPWAs were identified (60+ years old) and their records were linked to data in local cancer registries, finding 1142 cases. Expected case numbers were derived from the cancer incidence in the population matched for age, sex, race, calendar year, and registry. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, the relative risk (RR) for Kaposi sarcoma was 545 (95% CI, 406-717) in the 2 years after AIDS onset. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the RR was 24.6 (7.5-80.3). No cervical cancers were reported in this interval. From 60 months before to 27 months after AIDS onset, the RR of non-AIDS-defining cancers (n = 548) was 1.3 (1.2-1.4). The cancer types occurring at significant excess during this period were similar to those in younger adults with AIDS: Hodgkin lymphoma (RR: 13.1), anal cancer (8.2), liver cancer (3.9), multiple myeloma (2.7), leukemia (2.4), and lung cancer (1.9). However, none was significantly elevated in the 2 years after the AIDS onset. Prostate cancer risk was low overall (RR: 0.8; 0.6-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The profile of cancer risks in EPWAs generally resembled that in younger adults with AIDS, although RRs were lower because of higher background incidence rates. We speculate that prostate cancer risk was low because of reduced screening for this cancer in EPWAs.","['Biggar, Robert J', 'Kirby, Katharine A', 'Atkinson, Jonnae', 'McNeel, Timothy S', 'Engels, Eric']","['Biggar RJ', 'Kirby KA', 'Atkinson J', 'McNeel TS', 'Engels E']","['From *Viral Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. biggarb@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/complications/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['00126334-200407010-00014 [pii]', '10.1097/00126334-200407010-00014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2004 Jul 1;36(3):861-8. doi: 10.1097/00126334-200407010-00014.,,,,,,['AIDS Cancer Match Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a transcription factor that has close homology to a Drosophila protein, runt, and is found to play essential roles in regulation of hematopoietic systems. Really a gene disruption experiment unequivocally shows that Runx1 is absolutely required for the establishment of definitive or adult-type hematopoiesis. Moreover, accumulated evidence from a number of in vitro studies and findings in patients with familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML) strongly suggests that it also commits to the control of hematopoietic system in adult life, although the in depth analysis of its roles in adult hematopoiesis has been largely hampered by premature lethality of Runx1-null animals. Recently we have developed conditional knockout mice in which Runx1 is disrupted specifically in hematopoietic compartments after birth and dissected its roles in adult hematopoiesis. Notably, in these mice, maturation of megakaryocytes and development of both T and B lymphocytes were severely impaired, whereas hematopoietic progenitors were maintained or even expanded with apparently normal myeloid and erythroid differentiation in the periphery and bone marrow. Our findings clearly demonstrated differential requirement of Runx1 in stem cell development and in its maintenance together with multi-modal functions of this transcription factor that are critically required for maturation of megakaryocytes and lymphocyte development, also providing a novel insight into how deeply amd meticulously Runx1 is involved in regulation of mammalian hematopoiesis.","['Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Asai, Takashi', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Ogawa, Seishi']","['Ichikawa M', 'Asai T', 'Chiba S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Genes, Regulator/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",21,2004/06/24 05:00,2005/05/03 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['951 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Jun;3(6):722-4.

Its clinical use is burdened by QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death. In the present study, we analyzed the molecular mechanisms leading to As(2)O(3)-induced abnormalities of cardiac electrophysiology. Using biochemical and electrophysiological methods, we show that long-term exposure to As(2)O(3) increases cardiac calcium currents and reduces surface expression of the cardiac potassium channel human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) at clinically relevant concentrations of 0.1 to 1.5 microM. In ventricular myocytes, As(2)O(3) increases action potential duration measured at 30 and 90% of repolarization. As(2)O(3) interferes with hERG trafficking by inhibition of hERG-chaperone complexes and increases calcium currents by a faster cellular process. We propose that an increase in cardiac calcium current and reduced trafficking of hERG channels to the cell surface cause QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in patients treated with As(2)O(3). Our results suggest that calcium-channel antagonists will be useful in normalizing QT prolongation during As(2)O(3) therapy. As(2)O(3) is the first example of a drug that produces hERG liability by inhibition of ion-channel trafficking. Other drugs that interfere with proteins in the processing pathway of cardiac ion channels may be proarrhythmic for similar reasons.","['Ficker, Eckhard', 'Kuryshev, Yuri A', 'Dennis, Adrienne T', 'Obejero-Paz, Carlos', 'Wang, Lu', 'Hawryluk, Peter', 'Wible, Barbara A', 'Brown, Arthur M']","['Ficker E', 'Kuryshev YA', 'Dennis AT', 'Obejero-Paz C', 'Wang L', 'Hawryluk P', 'Wible BA', 'Brown AM']","['Rammelkamp Center, MetroHealth Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, 2500 MetroHealth Drive, Cleveland, OH 44109, USA. eficker@metrohealth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Heart Ventricles/cytology', 'Humans', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.66.1.33 [doi]', '66/1/33 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Jul;66(1):33-44. doi: 10.1124/mol.66.1.33.,,,,,"['HL36930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55404/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL61642/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No in vivo studies show whether the altered adhesion properties affect BCR/ABL leukemogenesis. Using mice with homozygous inactivation of genes encoding the 2 adhesion molecules P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), we show that the mutant mice develop BCR/ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like leukemia at a significantly faster rate than do wild-type (WT) mice. Lack of P-selectin and ICAM1 did not have a significant effect on the development of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL) induced by BCR/ABL. Using mice deficient for P-selectin or ICAM1 alone, we show that P-selectin plays a major role in the acceleration of CML-like leukemia. Lack of P-selectin resulted in early release of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors from bone marrow, appearing to alter the biologic properties of leukemic cells rather than their growth rate by increasing their homing to the lungs, causing fatal lung hemorrhages. These results indicate that adhesion of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors to marrow stroma through P-selectin and ICAM1 play an inhibitory role in the development of CML-like disease, suggesting that improvement of adhesion between BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitor cells and bone marrow stroma may be of therapeutic value for human CML.","['Pelletier, Shawn D', 'Hong, Daniel S', 'Hu, Yiguo', 'Liu, Yuhua', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Pelletier SD', 'Hong DS', 'Hu Y', 'Liu Y', 'Li S']","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Homozygote', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'P-Selectin/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-09-3033 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43377-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 1;104(7):2163-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-09-3033.

Extensive studies have elucidated molecular components that mediate the activation of JNKs. However, it remains unclear whether activation of JNKs by various stress signals involves different pathways. Here we show that K(+) channel activity is involved in mediating apoptosis induced by UV but not by H(2)O(2) in myelocytic leukemic ML-1 cells. Specifically, JNKs were rapidly phosphorylated upon treatment of ML-1 cells with UV and H(2)O(2). UV-induced, but not H(2)O(2)-induced, JNK-1 phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreatment with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a K(+) channel blocker. 4-AP also blocked UV-induced increase in JNK activity as well as p38 phosphorylation. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that phosphorylated JNKs were concentrated at centrosomes in ML-1 cells and that these proteins underwent rapid subcellular translocation upon UV treatment. Consistently, the subcellular translocation of JNKs induced by UV was largely blocked by 4-AP. Furthermore, UV-induced JNK activation was blocked by NEM, a sulfhydryl alkylating agent also affecting K(+) current. Both UV- and H(2)O(2)-induced JNK activities were inhibited by glutathione, suggesting that the redox status does play an important role in the activation of JNKs. Taken together, our findings suggest that JNK activation by UV and H(2)O(2) is mediated by distinct yet overlapping pathways and that K(+) channel activity and redox status are differentially required for UV- and H(2)O(2)-induced activation of JNKs.","['Gao, Jie', 'Wu, Dan', 'Guo, Taylor B', 'Ruan, Qin', 'Li, Tie', 'Lu, Zhenyu', 'Xu, Ming', 'Dai, Wei', 'Lu, Luo']","['Gao J', 'Wu D', 'Guo TB', 'Ruan Q', 'Li T', 'Lu Z', 'Xu M', 'Dai W', 'Lu L']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Shanghai Second Medical University, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Potassium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphorylation', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.047 [doi]', 'S0014482704001867 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Jul 15;297(2):461-71. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.047.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As reported in the majority of studies, an increase in maximal oxygen consumption and a lowering of the respiratory quotient indicate that dietary carnitine has the potential to stimulate lipid metabolism. Treatment with L-carnitine also has been shown to induce a significant postexercise decrease in plasma lactate, which is formed and used continuously under fully aerobic conditions. Data from preliminary studies have indicated that L-carnitine supplementation can attenuate the deleterious effects of hypoxic training and speed up recovery from exercise stress. Recent data have indicated that L-carnitine plays a decisive role in the prevention of cellular damage and favorably affects recovery from exercise stress. Uptake of L-carnitine by blood cells may induce at least three mechanisms: 1) stimulation of hematopoiesis, 2) a dose-dependent inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and 3) the prevention of programmed cell death in immune cells. As recently shown, carnitine has direct effects in regulation of gene expression (i.e., carnitine-acyltransferases) and may also exert effects via modulating intracellular fatty acid concentration. Thus there is evidence for a beneficial effect of L-carnitine supplementation in training, competition, and recovery from strenuous exercise and in regenerative athletics.","['Karlic, Heidrun', 'Lohninger, Alfred']","['Karlic H', 'Lohninger A']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Vienna, Austria. heidrun.karlic@chello.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,"['33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)', 'SAA04E81UX (Coenzyme A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carnitine/*administration & dosage', 'Coenzyme A/metabolism', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Exercise/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Lactic Acid/blood', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Sports/*physiology', 'Weight Loss']",93,2004/06/24 05:00,2005/03/11 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.nut.2004.04.003 [doi]', 'S0899900704000942 [pii]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 2004 Jul-Aug;20(7-8):709-15. doi: 10.1016/j.nut.2004.04.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we demonstrated that the Grp78 promoter is able to eradicate tumors using murine cells in immunocompetent models by driving expression of the HSV-tk suicide gene. Here, through the use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we provide direct evidence of spontaneous in vivo activation of the HSV-tk suicide gene driven by the Grp78 promoter in growing tumors and its activation by photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a controlled manner. In this report, we evaluated whether this promoter can be applied to human cancer therapy. We observed that the Grp78 promoter, in the context of a retroviral vector, was highly activated by stress and PDT in three different types of human breast carcinomas independent of estrogen receptor and p53. Complete regression of sizable human tumors was observed after prodrug ganciclovir treatment of the xenografts in immunodeficient mice. In addition, the Grp78 promoter-driven suicide gene is strongly expressed in a variety of human tumors, including human osteosarcoma. In contrast, the activity of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter varied greatly in different human breast carcinoma cell lines, and in some cases, stress resulted in partial suppression of the LTR promoter activity. In transgenic mouse models, the Grp78 promoter-driven transgene is largely quiescent in major adult organs but highly active in cancer cells and cancer-associated macrophages, which can diffuse to tumor necrotic sites devoid of vascular supply and facilitate cell-based therapy. Thus, transcriptional control through the use of the Grp78 promoter offers multiple novel approaches for human cancer gene therapy.","['Dong, Dezheng', 'Dubeau, Louis', 'Bading, James', 'Nguyen, Khoi', 'Luna, Marian', 'Yu, Hong', 'Gazit-Bornstein, Gadi', 'Gordon, Erlinda M', 'Gomer, Charles', 'Hall, Frederick L', 'Gambhir, Sanjiv S', 'Lee, Amy S']","['Dong D', 'Dubeau L', 'Bading J', 'Nguyen K', 'Luna M', 'Yu H', 'Gazit-Bornstein G', 'Gordon EM', 'Gomer C', 'Hall FL', 'Gambhir SS', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, 1441 Eastlake Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Chaperones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/12/17 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303404323142006 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2004 Jun;15(6):553-61. doi: 10.1089/104303404323142006.,,,,,"['CA 27607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Procedures described so far to obtain specific T-cells transduced with a suicide gene have led to the recovery of heterogeneous polyclonal T-cells with a limited level of purity. We have therefore developed an approach to select specific T-cell clones in which the suicide transgene is inserted at a unique site of the genome, and used it to produce CD(+)-cytotoxic HLA-DP-specific T-cell clones. Immunization was performed by a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture and responder T lymphocytes were transduced at day 16, 6 days after the second stimulation. Transductions were carried out using gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped retroviral particles harboring a bicistronic Thy-1/TK vector produced by TEFLY GA16-pKM4 clone 34 packaging cells. Three to 5 days later, CD90 immunomagnetic selection and cloning were performed on the transduced T cells. Our results demonstrate that this procedure led to the recovery of T-cell clones, the majority of which had the expected specificity and a single site of transgene insertion.

At concentrations of either agent below those that inhibited topo II the cells responded normally to interleukin-3, which promoted proliferation, and to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which promoted differentiation and maturation. In dose ranges in which topo II was inhibited by either hydroquinone or etoposide, the cells became progressively less viable and cell counts decreased during the incubation period. Progressive inability to detect topo II protein by Western blot analysis as hydroquinone concentrations were increased suggested that either association of the probe with the enzyme was inhibited by hydroquinone or there was degradation of the protein as a function of hydroquinone-induced apoptosis.","['Fung, Jacqueline', 'Hoffmann, Matthew J', 'Kim, David D', 'Snyder, Robert']","['Fung J', 'Hoffmann MJ', 'Kim DD', 'Snyder R']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Myoblasts/drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jat.960 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2004 May-Jun;24(3):183-8. doi: 10.1002/jat.960.,,"['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, proliferative indices (PIs) provide valuable prognostic information in this setting. Nonetheless, one shortcoming of PI measurements is that they depend not only on the proliferative activity of the neoplastic cells in a given lesion, but also on the activity of any admixed reactive cells. The current report describes an approach to identifying neoplastic and reactive subpopulations in cytologic preparations and to comparatively characterizing the morphologic features of neoplastic cells and assessing their proliferative activity. METHODS: Reactive and malignant lymph node samples were obtained from 37 patients during surgical biopsy. Giemsa stained touch imprints were used for morphometric and high-resolution videomicroscopic analyses. Immunofluorescence-based detection of pKi-67-positive cells was used in conjunction with morphometric analysis to assess the proliferative activity of tumor cells. RESULTS: Morphometric analysis allowed the selective identification of neoplastic cells in large cell lymphomas (LCLs). The morphologic characteristics of neoplastic cells in primary and secondary LCLs were found to be similar. The PI was highly dependent on the proportion of tumor cells present in the tissue sample analyzed, and in some samples with large proportions of reactive cells, the overall percentage of pKi-67-positive cells was low, but the majority of neoplastic cells nonetheless were positive for pKi-67. Most primary LCLs had very high tumor cell PIs (80-100%), whereas all secondary LCLs had moderate tumor cell PIs. CONCLUSIONS: Neoplastic cell subpopulations in LCLs can be identified on morphometric analysis, which can be performed using touch imprints; this technique allows evaluation of the proliferative activity of tumor cells. The authors propose that the use of tumor cell PIs rather than PIs for overall cell populations will result in more accurate assessment of disease prognosis.","['Sheval, Eugene V', 'Churakova, Janna V', 'Dudnik, Oksana A', 'Vorobjev, Ivan A']","['Sheval EV', 'Churakova JV', 'Dudnik OA', 'Vorobjev IA']","['Hematology Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia. sheval_e@genebee.msu.su']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/pathology', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/*pathology']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20341 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Jun 25;102(3):174-85. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20341.,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to identify potential CaG receptor(s), we found that CaG-induced phagocyte migration was specifically attenuated by the bacterial chemotactic peptide fMLP, suggesting these two chemoattractants might share a receptor. In fact, CaG chemoattracts rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL cells) expressing the high affinity human fMLP receptor FPR, but not parental RBL cells or cells transfected with other chemoattractant receptors. In addition, a specific FPR Ab and a defined FPR antagonist, cyclosporin H, abolished the chemotactic response of phagocytes and FPR-transfected cells to CaG. Furthermore, CaG down-regulated the cell surface expression of FPR in association with receptor internalization. Unlike fMLP, CaG did not induce potent Ca(2+) flux and was a relatively weaker activator of MAPKs through FPR. Yet CaG activated an atypical protein kinase C isozyme, protein kinase Czeta, which was essential for FPR to mediate the chemotactic activity of CaG. Thus, our studies identify CaG as a novel, host-derived chemotactic agonist for FPR and expand the functional scope of this receptor in inflammatory and immune responses.","['Sun, Ronghua', 'Iribarren, Pablo', 'Zhang, Ning', 'Zhou, Ye', 'Gong, Wanghua', 'Cho, Edward H', 'Lockett, Stephen', 'Chertov, Oleg', 'Bednar, Filip', 'Rogers, Thomas J', 'Oppenheim, Joost J', 'Wang, Ji Ming']","['Sun R', 'Iribarren P', 'Zhang N', 'Zhou Y', 'Gong W', 'Cho EH', 'Lockett S', 'Chertov O', 'Bednar F', 'Rogers TJ', 'Oppenheim JJ', 'Wang JM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, rat)']",IM,"['Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemotactic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Phagocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/*physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.173.1.428 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Jul 1;173(1):428-36. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.1.428.,,,,,"['DA 06650/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 11130/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 14230/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CO 12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ROS was presumed to affect the activity of the caspase cascade on the basis of findings that antioxidants inhibited the activation of caspases and that the stimulation of ROS by itself activated caspases, the mechanism by which these cellular events are integrated in Fas signaling is presently unclear. In this study, using human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells as well as an in vitro reconstitution system, we demonstrate that ROS are required for the formation of apoptosome. We first showed that ROS derived from mitochondrial permeability transition positively regulated the apoptotic events downstream of mitochondrial permeability transition. Then, we revealed that apoptosome formation in Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells was clearly inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine and manganese superoxide dismutase by using both the immunoprecipitation and size-exclusion chromatography methods. To confirm these in vivo findings, we next used an in vitro reconstitution system in which in vitro-translated apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), procaspase-9, and cytochrome c purified from human placenta were activated by dATP to form apoptosome; the formation of apoptosome was markedly inhibited by reducing reagents such as DTT or reduced glutathione (GSH), whereas hydrogen peroxide prevented this inhibition. We also found that apoptosome formation was substantially impaired by GSH-pretreated Apaf-1, but not GSH-pretreated procaspase-9 or GSH-pretreated cytochrome c. Collectively, these results suggest that ROS plays an essential role in apoptosome formation by oxidizing Apaf-1 and the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and -3.","['Sato, Tsutomu', 'Machida, Takuro', 'Takahashi, Sho', 'Iyama, Satoshi', 'Sato, Yasushi', 'Kuribayashi, Kageaki', 'Takada, Kohichi', 'Oku, Takatomi', 'Kawano, Yutaka', 'Okamoto, Tetsuro', 'Takimoto, Rishu', 'Matsunaga, Takuya', 'Takayama, Tetsuji', 'Takahashi, Minoru', 'Kato, Junji', 'Niitsu, Yoshiro']","['Sato T', 'Machida T', 'Takahashi S', 'Iyama S', 'Sato Y', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Takada K', 'Oku T', 'Kawano Y', 'Okamoto T', 'Takimoto R', 'Matsunaga T', 'Takayama T', 'Takahashi M', 'Kato J', 'Niitsu Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Section 4), Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, South-1 West-16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.173.1.285 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Jul 1;173(1):285-96. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.1.285.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other markers for differentiation into eosinophils such as changes in intracellular structure, and expressions of integrin beta7 and major basic protein, and the inhibition of cell proliferation were also induced by apicidin and n-butyrate but not by TSA. 5 Continuous acetylation of histone H4 achieved by repeated treatment with TSA (30 nm) at an interval of 12 h for more than three times induced such changes when examined on day 6. In addition, the induction was impaired by shortening the period of incubation with apicidin (100 nm) or n-butyrate (500 microm). 6 CCAAT/enhancer binding protein was continuously activated by apicidin (100 nm) and n-butyrate (500 microm), but was transiently activated by TSA (30 nm). 7 These findings suggest that the continuous acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is necessary for the differentiation of HL-60 clone 15 cells into eosinophils.","['Ishihara, Kenji', 'Hong, JangJa', 'Zee, OkPyo', 'Ohuchi, Kazuo']","['Ishihara K', 'Hong J', 'Zee O', 'Ohuchi K']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiological Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (apicidin)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2004/06/24 05:00,2005/01/29 09:00,['2004/06/24 05:00'],"['2004/06/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjp.0705869 [doi]', 'sj.bjp.0705869 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2004 Jul;142(6):1020-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0705869.

Radiosensitivity of HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells was determined by test of clonogenity. Decrease of dose-rate had no effect on radiosensitivity of MOLT-4 cells (D(0) for HDR 0.87 Gy, for LDR 0.78 Gy and for SLDR 0.70 Gy). In contrast, a significant increase of radioresistance after LDR irradiation was observed for p53 negative HL-60 cells (D(0) for HDR 2.20 Gy and for LDR 3.74 Gy). After an additional decrease of dose-rate (SLDR) D(0) value (2.92 Gy) was not significantly different from HDR irradiation. Considering the fact that during HDR the cells are irradiated in all phases of the cell cycle and during LDR mainly in the G2 phase, we have been unable to prove that the G2 phase is the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle of HL-60 cells. On the contrary, irradiation of cells in this phase induced damage reparation and increased radioresistance. When the dose-rate was lowered, approximately to 1.8 mGy/min, an opposite effect was detected, i.e. D(0) value decreased to 2.9 Gy. We have proved that during SLDR at first (dose up to 2.5 Gy) the cells accumulated in G2 phase, but then they entered mitosis or, if the cell damage was not sufficiently repaired, the cells entered apoptosis. The entry into mitosis has a radiosensibilizing effect.","['Vavrova, J', 'Rezacova, M', 'Vokurkova, D', 'Psutka, J']","['Vavrova J', 'Rezacova M', 'Vokurkova D', 'Psutka J']","['Institute of Radiobiology and Imunology, Purkyne Military Medical Academy, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

In addition, BCE inhibited the IL-4, IL-5 and TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA and A23187 in human leukemia mast cells, HMC-1.

The steps involved in this complex differentiation process are numerous and involve first the differentiation to early erythoid progenitors (burst-forming units-erythroid, BFU-E), then to late erythroid progenitors (colony-forming units-erythroid) and finally to morphologically recognizable erythroid precursors. A key event of late stages of erythropoiesis is nuclear condensation, followed by extrusion of the nucleus to produce enucleated reticulocytes and finally mature erythrocytes. During the differentiation process, the cells became progressively sensitive to erythropoietin that controls both the survival and proliferation of erythroid cells. A normal homeostasis of the erythropoietic system requires an appropriate balance between the rate of erythroid cell production and red blood cell destruction. Growing evidences outlined in the present review indicate that apoptotic mechanism play a relevant role in the control of erythropoiesis under physiologic and pathologic conditions. Withdrawal of erythropoietin or stimulation of death receptors such as Fas or TRAIL-Rs leads to activation of a subset of caspase-3, -7 and -8, which then cleave the transcription factors GATA-1 and TAL-1 and trigger apoptosis. In addition, there is evidence that a number of caspases are physiologically activated during erythroid differentiation and are functionally required for erythroid maturation. Several caspase substrates are cleaved in differentiating cells, including the protein acinus whose activation by cleavage is required for chromatin condensation. The studies on normal erythropoiesis have clearly indicated that immature erythroid precursors are sensitive to apoptotic triggering mediated by activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. These apoptotic mechanisms are frequently exacerbated in some pathologic conditions, associated with the development of anemia (ie, thalassemias, multiple myeloma, myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia). The considerable progress in our understanding of the apoptotic mechanisms underlying normal and pathologic erythropoiesis may offer the way to improve the treatment of several pathologic conditions associated with the development of anemia.","['Testa, U']",['Testa U'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. u.testa@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Anemia/etiology/pathology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/pathology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",207,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/24 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403383 [doi]', '2403383 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jul;18(7):1176-99. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403383.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to 1997. METHODS AND RESULTS: The new cohort included 51 367 employees, of whom 10 249 were dead. Mortality rates for all workers were low compared to national rates, as were rates in radiation workers and for workers monitored for internal contamination. For radiation workers all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for non-radiation workers. There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation dose. There was little evidence of raised mortality from leukaemia. The association of prostatic cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous reports. However, the relatively high mortality from uterine cancers among radiation workers remained, though the numbers were very small. The association was with endometrial rather than cervical cancer. Mortality from cancer of the pleura was high among radiation workers, but was not correlated with dose. CONCLUSION: Overall, radiation workers at UKAEA showed no excess mortality. The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical artefact or a risk associated with discontinued activities. Endometrial cancer occurred at higher rates in female radiation workers, but, because there was no correlation with dose, may well be due to something other than their radiation exposure. Cancer of the pleura in radiation workers was almost certainly related to past asbestos exposure.","['Atkinson, W D', 'Law, D V', 'Bromley, K J', 'Inskip, H M']","['Atkinson WD', 'Law DV', 'Bromley KJ', 'Inskip HM']","['Radiation Dosimetry, Health Physics Division, Health Effects, RWE NUKEM, 351.28 Harwell, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0RA, UK. will.atkinson@rwenukem.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Ischemia/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Nuclear Energy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pleural Neoplasms/mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/mortality', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/mortality']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.2003.012443 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2004 Jul;61(7):577-85. doi: 10.1136/oem.2003.012443.,,,,,,,,,PMC1740809,,,,,,,,,

Such an understanding of cancer biology could have a substantial impact on how we detect, diagnose, and manage cancer cases in the clinical setting. One of the biggest challenges facing clinical oncologists is how to extract clinically useful knowledge from the overwhelming amount of raw molecular data that are currently available. In this paper, we discuss how the exploratory data analysis techniques of machine learning and high-dimensional visualization can be applied to extract clinically useful knowledge from a heterogeneous assortment of molecular data. After an introductory overview of machine learning and visualization techniques, we describe two proprietary algorithms (PURS and RadViz) that we have found to be useful in the exploratory analysis of large biological data sets. We next illustrate, by way of three examples, the applicability of these techniques to cancer detection, diagnosis, and management using three very different types of molecular data. We first discuss the use of our exploratory analysis techniques on proteomic mass spectroscopy data for the detection of ovarian cancer. Next, we discuss the diagnostic use of these techniques on gene expression data to differentiate between squamous and adenocarcinoma of the lung. Finally, we illustrate the use of such techniques in selecting from a database of chemical compounds those most effective in managing patients with melanoma versus leukemia.","['McCarthy, John F', 'Marx, Kenneth A', 'Hoffman, Patrick E', 'Gee, Alexander G', ""O'Neil, Philip"", 'Ujwal, M L', 'Hotchkiss, John']","['McCarthy JF', 'Marx KA', 'Hoffman PE', 'Gee AG', ""O'Neil P"", 'Ujwal ML', 'Hotchkiss J']","['AnVil Incorporated, Burlington, MA 01803, USA. jmccarthy@verizon.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['*Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",43,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/13 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1196/annals.1310.020 [doi]', '1020/1/239 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2004 May;1020:239-62. doi: 10.1196/annals.1310.020.,,,,,"['R43 CA096179-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 CA94429-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases enhanced signaling of the receptor is the hallmark. In some cases, like chronic monomyelocytic leukemia (CMML), the persistent PDGFR signaling is essential for the survival of the cancer cell. These findings induced the research community as well as the pharmaceutical industry to develop agents that block PDGFR signaling.

SRF is particularly important in T cell activation, and we now report that SRF activates basal transcription from the human T-cell leukemia virus-I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat (LTR). A DNA element, with similarity to the consensus cellular CArG box found in the c-fos promoter centered approximately 120 base pairs upstream from the viral transcription start site, has been identified and named the vCArG box. SRF activation of gene expression from the LTR was localized to the vCArG box, and mutation of this site abolished SRF responsiveness. An oligonucleotide probe containing the vCArG box bound purified SRF, and a complex formed on this probe with nuclear extract was supershifted by anti-SRF antibody. Moreover, a biotinylated probe containing the vCArG box bound SRF in avidin-biotin pull-down assays. Quantitative binding analysis yielded nanomolar affinities for both the viral and cellular CArG boxes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that SRF is resident on the HTLV-I LTR in vivo. These data identify a functional serum response element in the HTLV-I LTR and suggest that SRF may play an important role in regulating basal HTLV-I gene expression in early infection and reactivation from latency.","['Wycuff, Diane R', 'Yanites, Heather L', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Wycuff DR', 'Yanites HL', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, fos/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serum Response Element/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Latency']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/31 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2004.04.008 [doi]', 'S0042682204002533 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jul 1;324(2):540-53. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.04.008.,,,,,"['CA 55684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI 07471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA 09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further study the specificity of primer selection, we have utilized a defective MuLV in which the primer-binding site (PBS) has been altered to be complementary to a nonmammalian tRNA, yeast tRNA(Phe). Infectivity of the defective MuLV is dependent upon co-expression of yeast tRNA(Phe) in the cell. Defective MuLV genomes have been constructed in which the PBS was altered to be complementary to tRNA(Phe) that also encoded the cDNA for tRNA(Phe). Transfection of these defective proviral genomes into cells resulted in the production of infectious MuLV as determined by a single-round assay. The amount of infectious virus produced using this complementation system, though, was approximately 6-fold lower than that produced following transfection of defective proviral genomes with a wild-type PBS complementary to tRNA(Pro). The lower infectivity was not due to reduced expression of tRNA(Phe) in the transfected cells as compared to endogenous tRNA(Pro) or tRNA(Lys,3). Serial passage of the MuLV genome with a PBS complementary to tRNA(Phe) that encoded tRNA(Phe) resulted in amplification of the virus. Using this rescue system, we have passaged the virus for four serial passages, after which time a revertant genome in which the PBS was altered to be complementary to tRNA(Gln) was detected that grew to high titers following subsequent serial passage. The results of these studies suggest that MuLV has preferences for the tRNA primer used in reverse transcription and are discussed with respect to the mechanism of primer selection.","['Palmer, Matthew T', 'Morrow, Casey D']","['Palmer MT', 'Morrow CD']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 720 20th Street South, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Fungal)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Phe)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'RNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Fungal', 'RNA, Transfer, Phe/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', 'Reassortant Viruses', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/31 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2004.03.013 [doi]', 'S0042682204001953 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jul 1;324(2):430-8. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.03.013.,,,,,['AI 34749/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a new, quantitative cell fusion assay based on the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA)-induced expression of a luciferase reporter gene. The assay is objective, sensitive, linear over 2-3 orders of magnitude, amenable to microtiter-plate format, and generalizable to study fusion mediated by a variety of genes. Applied to HIV and MLV, cell fusion paralleled virus entry in terms of co-receptor requirements, need for post-translational processing of envelope, and complementation of SU mutations by soluble receptor-binding domain. However, biochemically measured fusion did not correlate with syncytia detected by standard light microscopy. When the assay indicated cell fusion occurred but overt syncytia were not observed, confocal microscopy using fluorescent protein markers showed that fusion was limited mainly to pairs of cells. Such nonprogressive cell fusion suggests that post-translational processing of envelope may be altered in heterokaryons co-expressing envelope and receptor.","['Ou, Wu', 'Xiong, Ying', 'Silver, Jonathan']","['Ou W', 'Xiong Y', 'Silver J']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Building 4 Room 336, 4 Center Drive, MSC 4060, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA. wou@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Giant Cells/cytology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Luciferases/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tetracycline/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/31 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2003/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.032 [doi]', 'S0042682204002132 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jul 1;324(2):263-72. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.032.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aloe-emodin inhibited cell proliferation and induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Investigation of the levels of cyclins B1, E and A by immunoblot analysis showed that cyclin E level was unaffected, whereas cyclin B1 and A levels increased with aloe-emodin in HL-60 cells. Investigation of the levels of cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk1 and 2, showed increased levels of Cdk1 but the levels of Cdk2 were not effected with aloe-emodin in HL-60 cells. The levels of p27 were increased after HL-60 cells were cotreated with various concentrations of aloe-emodin. The increase of the levels of p27 may be the major factor for aloe-emodin to cause G2/M arrest in these examined cells. Flow cytometric assays and DNA fragmentation gel electrophoresis also confirmed aloe-emodin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The levels of caspase-3 were increased after HL-60 cells were cotreated with 10 microM aloe-emodin for 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours.

Studies on the fine structure of dorsal root ganglia in AIDP are lacking. Our aim was to investigate the cytology and nuclear organization of primary sensory neurons in AIDP with axonal injury using ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analysis. The light cytology of the L5 dorsal ganglion showed the characteristic findings of neuronal axonal reaction. The organization of chromatin, nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and nuclear pores corresponded to transcriptionally active neurons. However, the hallmark of the nuclear response to axonal injury was the formation of numerous nuclear bodies (NBs; 6.37 +/- 0.6, in the AIDP, vs. 2.53 +/- 0.2, in the control, mean +/- SDM), identified as promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies by the presence of the protein PML. In addition to PML protein, nuclear bodies contained SUMO-1 and the transcriptional regulators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The presence of proteasome 19S was also detected in some nuclear bodies. We suggest that neuronal PML bodies could regulate the nuclear concentration of active proteins, a process mediated by protein interactions with PML and SUMO-1 proteins. In the AIDP case, the proliferation of PML bodies may result from the overexpression of some nuclear proteins due to changes in gene expression associated with axonal injury.","['Villagra, Nuria T', 'Berciano, Jose', 'Altable, Marcos', 'Navascues, Joaquin', 'Casafont, Inigo', 'Lafarga, Miguel', 'Berciano, Maria T']","['Villagra NT', 'Berciano J', 'Altable M', 'Navascues J', 'Casafont I', 'Lafarga M', 'Berciano MT']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Ganglia, Sensory/chemistry/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Guillain-Barre Syndrome/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/chemistry/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/08/19 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2003/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.nbd.2004.02.005 [doi]', 'S0969996104000397 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Dis. 2004 Jun;16(1):158-68. doi: 10.1016/j.nbd.2004.02.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1829); Editoral Archiv fuer pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und fuer klinische Medizin 8 (1855) 23]. The concept that adult tissues contain embryonic remnants that generally lie dormant, but that could be activated to become cancer was later formalized by Cohnheim [Path. Anat. Physiol. Klin. Med. 40 (1867) 1-79; Virchows Arch. 65 (1875) 64] and Durante [Arch. Memori ed Osservazioni di Chirugia Practica 11 (1874) 217-226], as the ""embryonal rest"" theory of cancer. An updated version of the embryonal rest theory of cancer is that cancers arise from tissue stem cells in adults. Analysis of the cellular origin of carcinomas of different organs indicates that there is, in each instance, a determined stem cell required for normal tissue renewal that is the most likely cell of origin of carcinomas [Lab. Investig. 70 (1994) 6-22]. In the present review, the nature of normal stem cells (embryonal, germinal and somatic) is presented and their relationships to cancer are further expanded. Cell signaling pathways shared by embryonic cells and cancer cells suggest a possible link between embryonic cells and cancer cells. Wilm's tumors (nephroblastomas) and neuroblastomas are presented as possible tumors of embryonic rests in children. Teratocarcinoma is used as the classic example of the totipotent cancer stem cell which can be influenced by its environment to differentiate into a mature adult cell. The observation that ""promotion"" of an epidermal cancer may be accomplished months or even years after the initial exposure to carcinogen (""initiation""), implies that the original carcinogenic event occurs in a long-lived epithelial stem cell population. The cellular events during hepatocarcinogenesis illustrate that cancers may arise from cells at various stages of differentiation in the hepatocyte lineage. Examples of genetic mutations in epithelial and hematopoietic cancers show how specific alterations in gene expression may be manifested as maturation arrest of a cell lineage at a specific stage of differentiation. Understanding the signals that control normal development may eventually lead us to insights in treating cancer by inducing its differentiation (differentiation therapy). Retinoid acid (RA) induced differentiation therapy has acquired a therapeutic niche in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and the ability of RA to prevent cancer is currently under examination.","['Sell, Stewart']",['Sell S'],"['Center and Ordway Research Institute, New York State Health Department, Wadsworth Center, P.O.

The monocyte migration induced by the conditioned media of cultured HUGECs was assayed by a modified Boyden Chamber micropore filtration membrane method. Effects of anti-MCP-1 antibody on monocyte migration was detected as well. RESULTS: The MCP-1 mRNA was only weakly expressed in HUGECs cultured under the condition of low concentration of glucose. Following a stimulation of high concentration of glucose (25 mmol/L), MCP-1 mRNA expression was upregulated from the 8th hour and reached the maximum at the 16th hour. Conditioned medium of cultured HUGECs stimulated with high concentration of glucose had marked chemotaxis for monocytes, which was inhibited by anti-MCP-1 antibody. CONCLUSION: HUGEC stimulated by high glucose may highly express MCP-1, and produce chemotatic factors for monocytes.","['Ding, Han-lu', 'Zhang, Jian-guo', 'Zhu, Miao-zhen', 'Luo, Xiang-dong', 'Liang, Guang-ping']","['Ding HL', 'Zhang JG', 'Zhu MZ', 'Luo XD', 'Liang GP']","['Department of Nephrology, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400042, China. dhanlu@eyou.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Glucose/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Glomerulus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2005/02/08 09:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Jul;20(4):450-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mitoxantrone-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60/MX2 was also compared to the parental cell line HL60 in terms of adduct formation in cellular DNA, RNA, and protein. DNA adduct formation detected using [14C]mitoxantrone as a single agent occurred at very low levels but addition of the formaldehyde-releasing prodrug AN-9 (pivaloyloxymethyl butyrate) increased adduct formation considerably in all cell lines tested. Adduct formation increased when increasing ratios of AN-9 were used, and were observed at maximal levels when AN-9 addition was 4 h after the addition of mitoxantrone. However, low levels of adducts were observed when AN-9 addition was 16 h prior to mitoxantrone. The ability of [14C]mitoxantrone to form adducts with DNA, RNA, and protein was assessed in HL60 cells, and DNA was found to be the major substrate for adduct formation. RNA was also shown to be a good substrate while protein adduct levels were consistently very low. In mitoxantrone-resistant HL60/MX2 cells, DNA adduct levels were approximately fourfold lower. To establish the influence of DNA methylation on the ability of mitoxantrone to form adducts in cells, decitabine was used to reduce DNA methylation levels in cells prior to mitoxantrone treatment. This was clearly shown to influence adduct formation, with increasing decitabine levels leading to a decrease in the level of adducts observed in both IMR-32 and MCF-7 cell lines. Collectively, these results suggest that two major factors that influence the extent of mitoxantrone adduct formation in cells are the availability of formaldehyde and the extent of genomic DNA methylation.","['Parker, Belinda S', 'Rephaeli, Ada', 'Nudelman, Abraham', 'Phillips, Don R', 'Cutts, Suzanne M']","['Parker BS', 'Rephaeli A', 'Nudelman A', 'Phillips DR', 'Cutts SM']","['Department of Biochemistry, La Trobe University, Victoria, 3086, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Proteins)', '122110-53-6 (pivalyloxymethyl butyrate)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Mitoxantrone/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2004/06/23 05:00,2005/04/02 09:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504003773994815 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2004;14(6):279-90. doi: 10.3727/096504003773994815.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has the unique property of inhibiting tumor growth as a simple cation, mainly because of its close resemblance to ferric iron. Even though its inability to shift between the trivalent and a divalent oxidation state precludes that gallium behaves as an iron analogue in every respect, it strongly interferes with cellular acquisition of iron from blood by competitive interaction with transferrin and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, gallium also seems to affect intracellular availability of iron already taken up via this pathway, probably due to its inhibitory activity on vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases. Apart from the consequences of iron deprivation, gallium exerts cytotoxic effects by direct interaction with the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in reduced dNTP pools and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Both the abundance of transferrin receptors and upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase render tumors susceptible to gallium-induced cytotoxicity. However, some experimental findings raise the question whether these effects resulting from the iron-mimicking properties of gallium are solely responsible for its antineoplastic activity or whether additional mechanisms are involved, such as antimitotic effects which result from its capability of inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The limitations experienced with gallium nitrate and gallium chloride, which call for a prolonged exposure to low steady-state gallium levels in blood in order to adequately exploit the affinity of gallium to tumor tissues and to avoid severe toxic effects, may be overcome by oral gallium complexes such as tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-onato)gallium(III) (gallium maltolate) or tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46), which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and show promise to initiate a revival of gallium in the clinical setting. These two investigational drugs, albeit differing in their complex stability, have both been developed with the intention of providing gallium in a form which allows sufficient intestinal absorption, but without altering its pharmacodynamic effects. Gallium complexes based on other rationales are scarce and, with regard to the well-known antineoplastic potential of this metal, noticeably under-explored. With the recent approval of arsenic trioxide for the second-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the clinical revival of arsenic compounds, which have been the mainstay of antileukemic therapy before the age of modern cancer chemotherapy, has already begun. Currently, strong efforts are being made to explore the activity spectrum in other (less rare) malignancies and to gain a deeper insight into the mode of action. Although this development is currently focusing on arsenic trioxide, it should be suited to stimulate investigations into the therapeutic potential of other arsenic compounds as well.","['Jakupec, Michael A', 'Keppler, Bernhard K']","['Jakupec MA', 'Keppler BK']","['Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Vienna, Wahringer Strasse 42, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Met Ions Biol Syst,Metal ions in biological systems,0406332,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Inorganic Chemicals)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'VRA0C6810N (gallium nitrate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Gallium/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Inorganic Chemicals/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/toxicity']",187,2004/06/23 05:00,2004/07/13 05:00,['2004/06/23 05:00'],"['2004/06/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Met Ions Biol Syst. 2004;42:425-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphate ion is known to be involved in cell metabolism, including the apoptotic cell death process. As phosphate accumulation decreases during apoptosis, we investigated the influence of type III NaPi co-transporter activity on (V)DMSA uptake during this type of cell death. METHODS: Uptake of (V)DMSA and phosphate was compared in a leukaemic cell line (U937) in vitro model after induction of apoptosis by a chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide (VP16). (V)DMSA biodistribution in nude mice during apoptosis was also investigated in a U937 xenograft in vivo model. The percentage of apoptosis in vitro and ex vivo was determined with annexin V fluorescein by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The in vitro results showed that, in parallel with the decrease in phosphate uptake during apoptosis, (V)DMSA accumulation is negatively correlated with the percentage of apoptosis. Biodistribution studies showed decreased accumulation of (V)DMSA in tumours after treatment with VP16. Animal studies also confirmed an inverse correlation between percentage of apoptosis in tumours and (V)DMSA uptake. CONCLUSION: The activity of type III NaPi co-transporter is inhibited during the early stages of apoptosis, leading to differential incorporation of (V)DMSA in viable cells and apoptotic cells both in vitro and in vivo.","['Denoyer, Delphine', 'Perek, Nathalie', 'Jeune, Nathalie Le', 'Frere, Delphine', 'Sabido, Odile', 'Clotagatide, Anthony', 'Dubois, Francis']","['Denoyer D', 'Perek N', 'Jeune NL', 'Frere D', 'Sabido O', 'Clotagatide A', 'Dubois F']","['Department of Biophysics and Radiopharmaceuticals, Cell Survival and Adhesion Research Group, University of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France. delphine.denoyer@univ-st-etienne.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Symporters)', '494JNQ8L28 (Technetium Tc 99m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Organ Specificity', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Symporters/*metabolism', 'Technetium Tc 99m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00259-004-1605-y [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2004 Oct;31(10):1421-7. doi: 10.1007/s00259-004-1605-y.

METHODS: In this pilot study, 58 patients, 33 with high-risk or advanced leukemia, were transplanted with cells from an HLA-haploidentical family donor with at least 1 of 6 loci mismatched. After conditioning, patients received non ex vivo, T cell-depleted grafts of G-CSF-primed bone marrow plus G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, as well as graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. RESULTS: All patients achieved sustained, full donor type engraftment. The incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD was 37.9% (22 of 58), and grades III and IV aGVHD developed in only 2 and 1 patients, respectively. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant association between the extents of HLA mismatching and the degree of aGVHD. Twenty six of 42 (61.9%) evaluable patients had developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) with limited cGVHD in 15. Nine patients relapsed, all but one with advanced or refractory leukemia. Fourteen patients died (24.1%), of whom 7 died of recurrent diseases and 7 of transplant-related complications (TRM): main causes of TRM were infection(2), intestinal pneumonia(2), CMV encephalitis(1), hepatitis(1) and aGVHD (1). Forty-four of the 58 patients (75.9%) survived and 42 (72.4%) were disease free with a median follow-up of 10 months (range, 2 to 37.5 months). The 2-year probabilities of disease-free survival for patients with standard and high risks were 77.6% and 63.2% respectively, which showed that high-risk disease status at transplantation was associated with worse disease-free survival (P=0.04). The degree of HLA mismatching between the donor and the recipient was not related to event-free survival (P=0.57), nor was cell number infused and aGVHD (P=0.78, 0.94 respectively). CONCLUSION: (1)HLA mismatched transplantation can be per formed without ex vivo T cell depletion. (2)Using G CSF mobilized PBSCs as a source of stem cells may be possible and safe even in HLA mismatched transplantation.","['Huang, Xiao-jun', 'Han, Wei', 'Xu, Lan-ping', 'Chen, Huan', 'Liu, Dai-hong', 'Chen, Yu-hong', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Lu, Jin', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Ren, Han-yun', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Huang XJ', 'Han W', 'Xu LP', 'Chen H', 'Liu DH', 'Chen YH', 'Jiang Q', 'Lu J', 'Liu KY', 'Ren HY', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. xjhrm@medmail.com.cn""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

We report here that BA may also have an effect on HL-60 cell differentiation. BA was cytotoxic to HL-60 cells with an IC50 of 5.7 microM after a 72-h treatment. Flow cytometry analysis showed that after exposure to 1-12 microM of BA for 72 h, approximately 10% of viable cells were in the sub-G1, presumably apoptotic, phase. At the same time differentiation was induced in approximately 10% (at 1 microM BA) to a maximum of 20% (at 6 microM BA) of cells as judged by the NBT-reduction test, and the expression of membrane markers CD11b and CD14. On the other hand, at 1 and 5 nM, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (DHD3) induced differentiation in approximately 10 and 70% of cells, respectively. At 1 nM DHD3, the addition of 1 microM BA increased differentiated cells from 10 to 43% and with 3 microM BA the increase was to 80%. BA also enhanced the effects of DHD3 in the expansion of the G1 cell population with a concomitant decrease of S phase cells. The effects of DHD3 and BA on CD11b and CD14 expression were inhibited by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. Our results suggest that BA may enhance the effect of DHD3 in inducing mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Poon, Ka-Hung', 'Zhang, Jinxia', 'Wang, Cheng', 'Tse, Anfernee Kai-Wing', 'Wan, Chi-Keung', 'Fong, Wang-Fun']","['Poon KH', 'Zhang J', 'Wang C', 'Tse AK', 'Wan CK', 'Fong WF']","['Bioactive Products Research Group, Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Triterpenes/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/08/19 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200407000-00013 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cad.0000132237.15427.23 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2004 Jul;15(6):619-24. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000132237.15427.23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed an efficient labeling system that uses T4 RNA ligase to attach a 3'-biotinylated donor molecule to target RNA. Microarray analyses indicate that directly labeled RNA is uniformly labeled, has higher signal intensity than comparable labeling methods and achieves high transcript detection sensitivity. The labeled donor molecule we have developed allows the attachment of multiple biotins, which increases target signal intensity up to 30%. We have used this direct-labeling method to detect previously discovered class predictor genes for two types of cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In order to test the sensitivity of direct RNA labeling, we analyzed the AML and ALL expression profiles for predictor genes that were previously found to show elevated expression in the disease state. Direct labeling of AML poly(A) RNA detects 90% of the class predictor genes that are detected by the IVT-based target amplification method used to discover the genes. These results indicate that the detection sensitivity, simplicity (single tube reaction) and speed (2 h) of this direct labeling protocol may be ideal for diagnostic applications that do not require target amplification.","['Cole, Kyle', 'Truong, Vivi', 'Barone, Dale', 'McGall, Glenn']","['Cole K', 'Truong V', 'Barone D', 'McGall G']","['Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051, USA. kyle_cole@affymetrix.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Biotinylation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Oligoribonucleotides/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Complementary/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/metabolism']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/nar/gnh085 [doi]', '32/11/e86 [pii]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jun 17;32(11):e86. doi: 10.1093/nar/gnh085.

Twenty of 24 deletions overlapped to define a 4.8-Mb region of minimal deletion between markers D6S1510 and D6S1692 within chromosome 6 band q16. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we found evidence of expression in hematopoietic cells for 3 of 15 genes in the region (GRIK2, C6orf111, and CCNC). Comparison between our own and published deletion data singled out GRIK2 as the gene most frequently affected by deletions of 6q in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Sequence analysis of GRIK2 in 14 ALL cases carrying heterozygous 6q deletions revealed a constitutional and paternally inherited C to G substitution in exon 6 encoding for an amino acid change in one patient. The substitution was absent among 232 normal alleles tested, leaving open the possibility that heterozygous carriers of such mutations may be susceptible to ALL. Although low in all normal hematopoietic tissues, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed higher baseline GRIK2 expression in thymus and T cells than other lineages. Among T-cell ALL patients, 6q deletion was associated with a statistically significant reduction in GRIK2 expression (P = 0.0001). By contrast, elevated GRIK2 expression was measured in the myelomonocytic line THP-1 and in one patient with common ALL. Finally, we detected significant levels of GRIK2 expression in prostate, kidney, trachea, and lung, raising the possibility that this gene may be protective against multiple tumor types.","['Sinclair, Paul B', 'Sorour, Amani', 'Martineau, Mary', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Mitchell, Wayne A', ""O'Neill, Elena"", 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Sinclair PB', 'Sorour A', 'Martineau M', 'Harrison CJ', 'Mitchell WA', ""O'Neill E"", 'Foroni L']","['Haematology Department, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Gluk2 kainate receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Kainic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic System/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Kainic Acid/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-1871 [doi]', '64/12/4089 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 15;64(12):4089-98. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-1871.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group included 153 cases (23 new and 130 from the literature). According to the World Health Organization classification, the group included 15 nasal and 38 nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas, 63 blastic NK-cell lymphomas, 14 cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferations, 10 cases of myeloid leukemia, six cases of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SCPLTCL) and seven peripheral T-cell lymphomas, unspecified. RESULTS: In general, these CD56+ hematological neoplasms had a poor prognosis, with only 27% of patients alive after a median follow-up of 12 months. The median survival was 13 months. Nasal and nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphomas and CD56+ SCPLTCL had the worst prognosis, with a median survival of 5, 6 and 5 months, respectively. Only nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphomas presenting with only skin lesions had a somewhat better prognosis (median survival 27 months). In blastic NK-cell lymphomas (median survival 14 months), age </=40 years, aggressive treatment with acute leukemia protocols and high TdT expression were associated with a more favorable prognosis. Striking similarities in histology, immunophenotype, clinical presentation and clinical behavior were found between blastic NK-cell lymphomas and CD56+ myeloid leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: CD56+ hematological neoplasms presenting in the skin have a poor prognosis, except for primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferations. The striking similarities between blastic NK-cell lymphomas and CD56+ myeloid leukemias presenting in the skin provide a rationale to treat these patients with more aggressive regimens, rather than with CHOP(-like) regimens and radiotherapy, which have proven to be inadequate therapies for this neoplasm.","['Bekkenk, M W', 'Jansen, P M', 'Meijer, C J L M', 'Willemze, R']","['Bekkenk MW', 'Jansen PM', 'Meijer CJ', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden. m.w.bekkenk@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdh268 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)48026-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2004 Jul;15(7):1097-108. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdh268.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred and ninety-four patients included in five trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B evaluating CMT in stage III NSCLC were included in this analysis. The primary objective was to identify factors that were predictors of survival and selected radiation-related toxicities using Cox regression models and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The Cox model shows that performance status (PS) 1 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.45; P=0.009] and thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) only (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.22-2.05; P=0.001) predicted for poorer survival, while baseline hemoglobin >/=12 g/dl predicted for improved survival (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.55-0.81; P </=0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Baseline hemoglobin and PS, as well as the use of CMT, have the greatest effect on survival in unresectable stage III NSCLC. The use of concurrent chemoradiation increases the risk of esophagitis, which remains the primary radiation-related toxicity.","['Socinski, M A', 'Zhang, C', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Dillman, R O', 'Clamon, G', 'Vokes, E', 'Akerley, W', 'Crawford, J', 'Perry, M C', 'Seagren, S L', 'Green, M R']","['Socinski MA', 'Zhang C', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Dillman RO', 'Clamon G', 'Vokes E', 'Akerley W', 'Crawford J', 'Perry MC', 'Seagren SL', 'Green MR']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Chicago, IL, USA. socinski@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Esophagitis/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdh282 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)48039-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2004 Jul;15(7):1033-41. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdh282.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the authors detected the percentages of apoptotic lymphoblasts and the expressions of apoptotic Fas protein and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein with flow cytometry in vitro after the incubation of lymphoblasts with heparin. Eleven newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children were included in the study. Lymphoblasts were incubated in all different levels of heparin concentrations (0, 10, and 20 U/mL) and the percentages of apoptotic lymphoblasts and the percentages of Fas protein and Bcl-2 proteins were simultaneously measured by flow cytometry at 0, 1, and 2 h.

In ts1-infected C1 cells, an unfolded protein response was identified by activation of the ER-resident transmembrane protein kinase PERK, an event that leads to hyperphosphorylation of eIF2 alpha, up-regulation of GRP78, increased amounts of GADD153/CHOP, and cleavage of procaspase-12. Up-regulation of GRP78 and cleavage of procaspase-12 were also detected in primary cultured astrocytes infected with ts1. In ts1-infected C1 cells, ER stress was followed by mitochondrial stress, detected as mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation, cleavage of procaspase-9, and induction of activated caspase-3. In the brainstems of ts1-infected mice, activated caspase-3 and damaged mitochondria were identified in astrocytes within areas showing spongiform degeneration.

In spite of the substantial incidence of childhood leukemia in the United States and other countries, neither epidemiology studies conducted in human populations nor hazard identification studies conducted using traditional animal models have identified environmental or other factors that are directly linked to increased risk of disease. Molecular biology data and mathematical modeling of incidence patterns suggest that pediatric leukemogenesis may occur through a multistage or ""multihit"" mechanism that involves both in utero and postnatal events. The authors propose that pediatric leukemias can be modeled experimentally using a ""multihit"" paradigm analogous to the ""initiation-promotion"" and ""complete carcinogenesis"" models developed for tumor induction in mouse skin and rat liver. In this model for childhood leukemia, an initial genetic alteration occurs during in utero or early postnatal development, but clinical disease develops only upon additional genetic or nongenetic events that occur during the postnatal period. Application of this multistage or ""multihit"" model to hazard assessment studies conducted in transgenic or knockout mice carrying relevant molecular lesions may provide a sensitive approach to the identification of environmental agents that are important risk factors for childhood leukemia.","['McCormick, David L', 'Kavet, Robert']","['McCormick DL', 'Kavet R']","['IIT Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois 60616, USA. dmccormick@iitri.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Toxicol,International journal of toxicology,9708436,,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Risk Factors']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10915810490471325 [doi]', 'LYDCK73JC4GEGFV0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Toxicol. 2004 May-Jun;23(3):149-61. doi: 10.1080/10915810490471325.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were treated with H2O2 with or without exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic fields. Viable cells, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined by annexin V flow cytometry assay. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3, caspase-7, Bcl-2 and Bax) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were detected using Western blotting. RESULTS: Simultaneous treatment with exposure to the magnetic field and H2O2 (85 or 100 microM) for 24 h increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells significantly, and significantly decreased the number of viable cells compared with cells treated with H2O2 alone. The protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 showed no differences between H2O2-treated cells and those treated with both H2O2 and an extremely low frequency magnetic field. Exposure to the magnetic field also had no effect on H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation. However, the protein levels of active caspase-7 in cells simultaneously exposed to an extremely low frequency magnetic field and H2O2 for 2 and 8 h was higher than that of H2O2 treatment alone. In addition, simultaneous exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic field and H2O2 caused poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and induced early inactivation at 2 h, while H2O2 treatment alone did not produce this effect until 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that although the magnetic field itself cannot induce apoptosis and necrosis, it exerts a promoting effect on H2O2-induced cell death, and it demonstrates that caspase-7 as well as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase might be involved in this process.","['Ding, G-R', 'Nakahara, T', 'Hirose, H', 'Koyama, S', 'Takashima, Y', 'Miyakoshi, J']","['Ding GR', 'Nakahara T', 'Hirose H', 'Koyama S', 'Takashima Y', 'Miyakoshi J']","['Department of Radiological Technology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Hirosaki University, 66-1 Hon-cho, Hirosaki 036-8564, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/radiation effects', 'Electricity', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Necrosis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/09553000410001679802 [doi]', 'ARK28A480U2PJQ5F [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2004 Apr;80(4):317-24. doi: 10.1080/09553000410001679802.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azole antifungal agents are increasingly used in this context. In vitro assays were performed to assess whether cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes were affected by combinations of cytarabine or idarubicin with itraconazole or caspofungin. METHODS: The high throughput microtiter assay was used to determine whether cytarabine, idarubicin and itraconazole or caspofungin were CYP450 isoenzyme substrates, inhibitors of CYP450 isoenzymes, and to determine potential CYP450 metabolism interactions between these agents. RESULTS: Idarubicin is a substrate for CYP450 2D6 and 2C9. Cytarabine is a substrate of CYP450 3A4. Idarubicin inhibits CYP450 2D6, and cytarabine, itraconazole, and caspofungin inhibit CYP450 3A4. Cytarabine metabolism was significantly decreased when combined with caspofungin or itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of cytarabine metabolism may have important clinical implications.

Long-term impairment of immunity against various common infectious stimuli leads to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases; in contrast, an immune response against the recipient may cause the devastating graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Recovery of the immune system (both qualitative and quantitative) after SCT is perhaps the most important factor in determining the clinical outcome. Consequently, immune reconstitution has been extensively studied using different approaches, including quantitative analysis of immune cells as well as their phenotypic characterization. Analysis of diversity and clonality is an important tool in determining competence of the immune system, assuming that a broad diversity assures efficient response to different stimuli and clonal dominance reflects ongoing, potentially relevant immune responses. Detailed analysis of the immune repertoire through the flow cytometric and molecular study of the T cell receptor repertoire has been applied to gain quantitative and qualitative insights about the T cell immune competence and responsiveness. After SCT, a contraction of the T cell pool and a reduction in T cell receptor diversity is clearly associated with clinical immunodeficiency. Reconstitution of the immune system is often characterized by dominance of oligoclonal T cell populations, reflecting specific antigen-driven immune responses. Detailed characterization of T lymphocytes by T cell receptor analysis is possible, and may lead to the identification of individual clones involved in specific immune reactions, such as alloresponses in GvHD, the closely related graft-versus-leukemia effect and opportunistic viral agents such as CMV or EBV.","[""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Risitano, Antonio M', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","[""O'Keefe CL"", 'Risitano AM', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology']",108,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330410001701530 [doi]', 'QHC88JME0FF7KBWE [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2004 Jun;9(3):189-98. doi: 10.1080/10245330410001701530.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two syndromes can be distinguished, one of which has a long latency (5-7 years or more) and is seen following alkylating agents, frequently with an antecedent dysplastic phase. The other has a short latency period (1-3 years), no antecedent dysplastic phase, and is characteristically seen following topoisomerase II inhibitors. Chromosomal abnormalities can confirm t-leuk/MDS and are predictive of poor prognosis, particularly those involving gains and losses of chromosome 7. There is no standard therapy for t-AML/MDS. This review concentrates on the various treatment approaches for t-AML/MDS. Treatment can be aggressive, with curative intent, particularly for patients who are young with no end-organ damage from the prior malignancy or chemotherapy. Various chemotherapy regimens have been designed to overcome the chemoresistance which is generally characteristic of these syndromes. Bone marrow transplantation offers the best chance for cure, and both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative protocols have been designed. Low dose chemotherapy is an option for patients not able to withstand traditional curative regimens and supportive care is a legitimate option for elderly or infirm patients.

Using immunophenotyping, molecular genetics and cytogenetics the low hanging fruits of biomedical research have been successfully incorporated in routine diagnosis of leukemia subclasses. Future improvements in the classification and understanding of leukemia biology will very likely be more slow and laborious. Recently, gene expression profiling has provided a framework for the global molecular analysis of hematological cancers, and high throughput proteomic analysis of leukemia samples is on the way. Here we consider classification of acute leukemia samples by flow cytometry using the marker proteins of immunophenotyping as a component of the proteome. Marker protein expressions are converted into quantitative expression values and subjected to computational analysis. Quantitative multivariate analysis from panels of marker proteins has demonstrated that marker protein expression profiles can distinguish MLLre from non-MLLre ALL cases and also allow to specifically distinguish MLL/AF4 cases. Potentially, these quantitative expression analyses can be used in clinical diagnosis. Immunophenotypic data collection using flow cytometry is a fast and relatively easily accessible technology that has already been implemented in most centers for leukemia diagnosis and the translation into quantitative expression data sets is a matter of flow cytometer settings and output calibration. However, before application in clinical diagnostics can occur it is crucial that quantitative immunophenotypic data set analysis is validated in independent experiments and in large data sets.","['Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Te Kronnie G', 'Bicciato S', 'Basso G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Italy. truustekronnie@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/blood/*classification/genetics/immunology', 'Proteomics']",25,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330410001701558 [doi]', 'TGNL78V100NP4Q8B [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2004 Jun;9(3):165-70. doi: 10.1080/10245330410001701558.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The myeloablative conditioning was radiation based. The source of stem cells was BM in 62, and cytokine-mobilized PBPC in 68 patients. GvHD prophylaxis was by ex vivo incubation of the stem-cell concentrates with Campath-1G (anti-CD52; n=76) or Campath-1H (n=54). RESULTS: Patients receiving PBPC grafts were older (median 38.5) than those undergoing BMT (median 31; P=0.002). More patients in the PBPC group developed chronic GvHD (p<0.01). While no post-transplant GvHD prophylaxis was given to BMT recipients, prednisone 30 mg daily was prescribed to 12 and CYA for 90 days to a further 32 patients who had received PBPC grafts. Median follow-up was 1055 (range 28-4867) days. Although there was no difference in the survival between patients who received BMT or PBPC, death was from disease recurrence in 16 and nine (p=0.03; chi(2) test) subjects, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that outcome was particularly favorable in those who were given<20 mg Campath-1 (survival: 28/39 versus 12/29; P=0.01), and in the subgroup of 30 patients who received Campath-1H and post-transplantation CYA. DISCUSSION: In patients receiving BMT, Campath-1 Abs effectively prevent GvHD.

Thirty one patients were males (72%). At 1st BMT (BMT1), median age was 11.5 years (range, 0.16-45 years). BMT1 was carried out for the diagnosis of AML in 13 patients (30%), SAA in nine (21%), ALL in six (14%), CML in six (14%), immunodeficiency in three (7%), NHL in two, beta-thal in two, HD in one, Red cell aplasia in one. HLA matching status for allogeneic BMT1 was full match in 33, one antigen mismatch in two and haplo identical in two patients. Median age at the 2nd BMT (BMT2) was 14 years (range, 0.41-46.7 years). Indications for BMT2 were recurrent hematologic neoplasm in 23 patients (53%), primary graft failure in 12 (28%) and late graft failure in 8 (19%). Median time from BMT1 to recurrence of hematologic neoplasm or late graft failure was 10 months (range, 2.5- 88 months). Median BMT1 to BMT2 interval was 13 months (range, 1-107 months). For BMT2, the same donor was used in 29 patients, while 14 patients had alternate related donor (12 full match, 1-one Ag mismatch, 1 haplo identical). A different conditioning regimen was used in the majority of the patients (39, 91%). Radiation containing conditioning regimen were used mostly for patients previously conditioned with chemotherapy only for BMT1 and chemotherapy conditioning +/- ATG for those who received radiation containing conditioning at BMT1. Bone marrow was the stem cell source for all patients at BMT2 and all except three autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation patient at BMT1. Significant organ toxicity leading to procedure related death in 13 patients (30%) was observed after BMT2. At a median follow up of 36 months after BMT2, 22 patients (51%) are alive (20 free of disease, 2 with recurrent disease) with overall median survival of 47.5 (SD +/- 9) months. Univariate analysis of relevant clinical factors identified the following variables as the only statistically significant favorable prognostic factors for overall survival: BMT1-BMT2 interval of > or = 6 months (P=0.0007) and age at BMT2 < or = 10 years (P=0.041). The nature of underlying disease (neoplastic or non-neoplastic) was not statistically significant (P=0.23). There was no statistically significant difference in survival outcome of BMT2 using same donor vs. alternate related donor (P=0.51). Due to the relatively limited sample size, multivariate analysis was not attempted. This single institution study suggests that second allogeneic BMT after myeloblative conditioning has an acceptable treatment related morbidity/mortality and favorable outcome if performed at age < or = 10 years and with an interval of > or = 6 months after the first BMT. Additionally same donor can successfully be used for the second transplant with similar survival outcome to alternate donor.","['Al-Qurashi, F', 'Ayas, M', 'Al Sharif, F', 'Ibrahim, E', 'Sahovic, E', 'Al Mahr, M', 'Chaudhri, N', 'Al Mohareb, F', 'Al Zahrani, H', 'Al Jefri, A', 'Al Omar, H', 'Al Shanqeeti, A', 'Seth, P', 'Aslam, M', 'El Solh, H', 'Aljurf, M']","['Al-Qurashi F', 'Ayas M', 'Al Sharif F', 'Ibrahim E', 'Sahovic E', 'Al Mahr M', 'Chaudhri N', 'Al Mohareb F', 'Al Zahrani H', 'Al Jefri A', 'Al Omar H', 'Al Shanqeeti A', 'Seth P', 'Aslam M', 'El Solh H', 'Aljurf M']","['Section of Adult Hematology/BMT Department of Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, P.O.

The balance in the expression of pro (Fas/CD95) and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) may control the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy and subsequently affect the patient's prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of Bcl-2 and Fas expression on blast cells from patients with acute leukemia and to correlate the degree of expression to the clinical and laboratory prognostic factors and the patient's outcome. Forty newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia (16 ALL, 24 AML) were included in the study. Ten normal subjects of matched age and sex were studied as a reference control group. The degree of Bcl-2 and Fas expression on acute leukemia blast cells were assessed before the start of therapy and on mononuclear cells after 1 year of follow up, using flow cytometry. The degree of Bcl-2 and Fas expression were significantly higher in AML (P<0.01,<0.05, respectively) and ALL (P<0.01, <0.05, respectively) as compared to controls. The expression of Fas and Bcl-2 was related to FAB type with the highest Bcl-2 and lowest Fas expression in M5 and T-ALL (P<0.01, for all). In ALL, patients responding to induction chemotherapy revealed lower Bcl-2 and higher Fas expression when compared to non-responders (P<0.05). In contrast, in AML the difference between responders and non-responders to induction chemotherapy regarding Bcl-2 and Fas expressions was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Bcl-2 and Fas expression were significantly elevated in the relapsed acute leukemia group (in both AML and ALL) when compared to those in remission (P<0.01, <0.05, respectively). Bcl-2 and Fas expression at diagnosis was not significantly different when those surviving were compared to the group who had died, either in the ALL or AML groups (P>0.05). Bcl-2 expression was significantly correlated to bone marrow blast cell counts (R=0.6, P<0.01), blast cell distribution ratio (R=0.4, P<0.05) and lymphadenopathy (R=0.33, P<0.05). Whereas Fas expression was significantly correlated to bone marrow blast cell counts (R=0.52, P<0.01). In conclusion, assessment of Bcl-2 and Fas expression at diagnosis in acute leukemia (1) could predict responsiveness to induction chemotherapy in ALL but not in AML group but (2) could not predict patients out come both in ALL and AML groups.","['Aref, S', 'Salama, O', 'Al-Tonbary, Y', 'Mansour, A']","['Aref S', 'Salama O', 'Al-Tonbary Y', 'Mansour A']","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine Mansoura University Mansoura Egypt. salaharef@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*immunology']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1024533042000205496 [doi]', 'J0LN4XF8YPFPM8QH [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2004 Apr;9(2):113-21. doi: 10.1080/1024533042000205496.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This critical effect has received little attention with respect to its potential therapeutic application in myeloid malignancies. We describe the clinical course of a 62-year-old patient with atypical AML1/ETO-positive AML-M2 who repeatedly displayed a marked, dose-dependent response to G-CSF. He was originally investigated for neutropenia, but declined chemotherapy at diagnosis of AML (40% bone marrow blasts) and commenced G-CSF therapy when a life-threatening chest infection occurred. The bone marrow infiltration regressed and his blood counts normalized after 20 days. A slow relapse occurred over the next 3 months but a second hematological remission was achieved upon reintroduction of G-CSF. He remained well and free of transfusions for 2.5 years, receiving only maintenance G-CSF. Despite the presence of the AML1/ETO transcript, his leukemic blasts always failed to demonstrate the typical morphological, immunological and cytogenetic characteristics of AML1/ETO-AML of M2 subtype. He eventually developed resistance to G-CSF and died from sepsis after cytotoxic therapy. In selected AML cases differentiation therapy with growth factors may emerge as a useful antileukemic strategy, either alone or as an adjunct to established treatment modalities.","['Zomas, A', 'Stefanoudaki-Sofianatou, K', 'Fisfis, M', 'Anagnostopoulos, N I']","['Zomas A', 'Stefanoudaki-Sofianatou K', 'Fisfis M', 'Anagnostopoulos NI']","['Department of Clinical Haematology ""G.Gennimatas"" Regional General Hospital of Athens 154 Mesogeion Avenue 115 27 Athens Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*blood/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*blood/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factors/*blood/*genetics']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330310001652491 [doi]', 'V9HCJ99CGC8NDLTA [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2004 Apr;9(2):107-11. doi: 10.1080/10245330310001652491.,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now becoming clear that truncations of AMLl are more common in leukemia than previously thought. To analyze the effect of truncated AML1 species on myeloid differentiation and proliferation, AML1-AMPl9 was retrovirally transduced into the IL-3-dependent 32D cells. 32D cells over-expressing AML1-AMPl9 failed to differentiate normally when stimulated with G-CSF, but continued to proliferate and maintained a primitive phenotype.

In this study we have seen the association of HLA genes with different types of bcr-abl transcripts. The association could predict the bcr-abl peptide presentation by particular HLA molecules. METHODS: The study included a total of 189 patients of mixed ethnicity with chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia who were being considered for bone marrow transplantation. Typing of bcr-abl transcripts was done by reverse transcriptase PCR method. HLA typing was performed by molecular methods. The bcr-abl and HLA association was studied by calculating the relative risks and chi-square test. RESULTS: Significant negative associations (p < 0.05) were observed with HLA-A*02 (b2a2, e1a2), -A*68 (b2a2, b3a2, e1a2), -B*14 (b2a2, b3a2, e1a2), -B*15 (b2a2, b3a2), -B*40 (b2a2), -DQB1*0303 (b2a2, b3a2), -DQB1*0603 (b2a2), -DRB1*0401 (e1a2), -DRB1*0701 (b3a2), and -DRB1*1101 (b2a2). CONCLUSIONS: The negative associations of a particular bcr-abl transcript with specific HLA alleles suggests that these alleles play a critical role in presenting peptides derived from the chimeric proteins and eliciting a successful T-cell cytotoxic response.

One way of improving the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies is to use them to deliver cytotoxic agents, such as radionuclides, to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies armed with radionuclides provide a means of targeting radiation therapy specifically to tumor cells that express the antigen to which the antibody was originally raised. Subsequently, in 2002, the first radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular or transformed B-cell NHL, including patients with follicular lymphoma refractory to rituximab. Attempts to optimize the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy are ongoing, however, and there are three factors that need to be considered: choice of antibody/antigen, choice of delivery of system to be used, and choice of radionuclide. CD25 (IL-2R alpha) is an ideal choice for a target antigen as it is over-expressed by a number of tumor cells, including adult T-cell leukemia (ATL); 9 of 16 patients with ATL responded to treatment with anti-Tac (which targets the interleukin-2 receptor-alpha [IL-2R alpha]), conjugated to 90Y. The dose of radionuclide that can be delivered to a tumor can be increased dramatically by using a three-step process in which the antibody and radioactivity are delivered separately to the antigen in order to improve tumor-to-normal tissue ratios. The most commonly used radionuclides in radioimmunotherapy to date are beta-emitters. However, the pretargeting process makes the use of short-lived alpha-emitters more feasible. The results of experiments involving this pretargeting process and alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides in leukemia and lymphoma models suggest that alpha-emitters may be more effective in the treatment of small tumors, micrometastases and isolated cells, and that beta-emitters may be more suitable for use in large tumor masses, such as lymphomas.","['Waldmann, Thomas']",['Waldmann T'],"['National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Bldg 10, Room 4N115, 10 Center Drive 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA. tawald@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Alpha Particles', 'Beta Particles', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use']",49,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/10/23 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001623685 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003;44 Suppl 3:S107-13. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001623685.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors contributing to this lower risk of relapse include an absence of the use of ablative conditioning, with a tumor-free graft, and the generation of a graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) immune response. Allogeneic transplantation, however, has the possibility of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). The use of autologous and conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in follicular lymphoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma is discussed. Due to a 1-year transplant-related mortality of 30-40% and complications caused by GVHD, conventional, myeloablative, allogeneic transplantation is a high-risk option for low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. Novel applications of allogeneic HSCT are described that take advantage of a GVT effect while reducing the risk of GVHD. Minimally myelotoxic pretransplant conditioning regimens allow host antigen-presenting cells to persist, enabling presentation of host minor histocompatibility antigens to donor T cells, causing a GVT response. Although complications may arise due to GVHD, non-myeloablative HSCT can be offered to patients previously ineligible for conventional high-dose treatment. A protocol developed in Seattle using a low-dose total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen with immunosuppression using mycophenolate mofetil in combination with cyclosporin has been used in a multicenter trial. To overcome the problem of graft rejection fludarabine was later added to the protocol. A second protocol from a smaller trial used a preparative, conventional-dose regimen of fludarabine, given with cyclophosphamide. Rituximab was also given to provide synergistic action with the chemotherapy to enhance tumor control in the early post-transplant period to allow time for the establishment of the GVT effect. Following transplantation, GVHD prophylaxis was given using tacrolimus with methotrexate. A trial of a further variation of allogeneic HSCT, tandem auto/allo transplants, is described. First, high-dose therapy with autologous PBSC rescue was used to cytoreduce the disease. This was followed by a reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative allogeneic graft. This procedure was devised to take advantage of high-dose therapy and allogeneic HSCT. Results for non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT are particularly promising in low-grade NHL and the GVT effect may augment response and delay or prevent relapse. However, for aggressive disease, non-myeloablative regimens are only indicated for patients with minimal disease, as the non-myeloablative regimens are unable to control the tumor before the generation of a GVT effect, and/or lack the ability to control rapidly proliferating disease. Patients with relapsed disease may require a higher-dose regimen or tandem transplant approach.","['Maloney, David G']",['Maloney DG'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview Avenue, North Seattle, D1-100, WA 98109-1024, USA. dmaloney@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",25,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/10/23 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001623694 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003;44 Suppl 3:S99-105. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001623694.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies that target cell-surface determinants have been used as single agents in B-cell malignancies, in combination with chemotherapy, and coupled to other agents to create radioimmunoconjugates and immunotoxins. Another approach is to take advantage of the graft-vs.-lymphoma effect seen following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. To exploit this effect without inducing the complication of graft-vs.-host disease, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms whereby lymphoma cells escape T-cell-mediated responses. CD40 activation may offer a means of increasing the immunogenicity of lymphoma cells and of stimulating allogeneic T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Vaccination using tumor-specific antigens shows promise as a therapeutic strategy. Pre-clinical studies with immunoglobulin idiotype peptides have shown that humoral and cellular immune responses can be stimulated by antibodies to these peptides, but better tumor antigens need to be identified that can reliably generate cytotoxic T-cell responses. Candidate antigens include heteroclitic peptides from the immunoglobulin V region and newly identified antigens including the cytochrome P450 1B1.

However, little is known about its molecular mechanisms. Here we show that induction of K562 or HEL cells with 1.5 mg/ml of Huangqi (Hex) (Components extracted from Huangqi) for 3-5 d results in the expression of beta-globin gene in both cell lines and leads to terminal differentiation. Moreover, the apoptosis in HEL cells can be induced by increasing concentration of Huangqi (Hex) to 4.5 mg/ml for 3-5 d. Upregulation of Apaf-1, caspase-3 and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in HEL cells may play a crucial role in the process of apoptosis. The prospect of inducing expression of adult (beta) globin gene and apoptosis selectively in cancer cells is obviously attractive from a therapeutic point of view.","['Cheng, Xiao-Dong', 'Hou, Chun-Hui', 'Zhang, Xue-Jun', 'Xie, Heng-Yue', 'Zhou, Wei-Ying', 'Yang, Lei', 'Zhang, Shu-Bing', 'Qian, Ruo-Lan']","['Cheng XD', 'Hou CH', 'Zhang XJ', 'Xie HY', 'Zhou WY', 'Yang L', 'Zhang SB', 'Qian RL']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '922OP8YUPF (Huang Qi)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Astragalus Plant', 'Astragalus propinquus', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology/*physiopathology']",,2004/06/19 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/06/19 05:00'],"['2004/06/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/abbs/36.3.211 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2004 Mar;36(3):211-7. doi: 10.1093/abbs/36.3.211.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bryo-induced increase in dCK/5'-NT activity alone has not been a conclusive indication of final clinical outcome. Therefore, we used an ex vivo assay to investigate factors which may affect the bryo-induced enhancement of 2-CdA efficacy in B-CLL patient-derived samples. Bryo-induced increase in dCK/5'-NT was inversely associated with Rai stage CLL (r=-0.86). Increased dCK/5'-NT activity was not correlated with increased efficacy (cell death) or percentage of cellular [8-3H]-2-CdA converted to [8-3H]-2-CdATP ex vivo. Bryo pre-treatment increased the cellular uptake of [8-3H]-2-CdA and incorporation of [8-3H]-2-CdA metabolites into the DNA fraction. Cell death from 2-CdA was inversely correlated with bryo-induced activity of the DNA repair enzyme, DNA-PKcs, (r=-0.77). Thus, the ability of B-CLL to repair damaged DNA may be a more important predictor of the response to bryo/2-CdA and eventual clinical outcome than dCK/5'-NT activity. Additional CLL patients under bryo-2-CdA therapy are needed to verify these important observations.","['Beck, Frances W J', 'Eilender, Davi S', 'Dandashi, Mahmoud H', 'Siddiq, Fauzia', 'Snell, Diane C', 'Godmere, Michele A', 'Al-Katib, Ayad M', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M']","['Beck FW', 'Eilender DS', 'Dandashi MH', 'Siddiq F', 'Snell DC', 'Godmere MA', 'Al-Katib AM', 'Mohammad RM']","['Wayne State University School of Medicine, 22324 Louis M.

Antioxidants are known to act as powerful free-radical scavengers. Free radicals are able to induce DNA strand breaks and oxidative modifications of DNA bases and are not only produced naturally in the cell following a stress or respiration but also following ionizing radiation. The present study was undertaken in order to explore whether some antioxidants naturally present in the food or in the beverages could enhance apoptosis in cancerous cells submitted to X-irradiation. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a potent antioxidant present in tea was tested on three human cancerous cell lines: HeLa (derived from cervix carcinoma), K-562 (derived from chronic myelogenous leukaemia) and IM-9 (derived from multiple myeloma). The parameters investigated were cell proliferation, morphological changes, cell cycle effects and apoptosis. When given alone, irradiation induced a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis as well as the appearance of polyploid cells in the three cell lines. All these effects were dose-dependent. Taking into account the various parameters, IM-9 cells appeared as the most radiation sensitive and HeLa cells as the least radiation sensitive, while K-562 cells exhibited an intermediary radiation sensitivity. EGCG had no effect on cell proliferation, while it induced a dose-dependent increase of apoptosis in the three cell lines. IM-9 cells were again most sensitive to this effect, while HeLa and K-562 cells were slightly less sensitive. A combined treatment by X-irradiation and EGCG resulted in a significant enhancement of apoptosis correlated with a decrease of proliferation in IM-9 and K-562 cells and at a lesser extent, in HeLa cells, compared to treatments by either EGCG or ionising radiation alone. In conclusion, these preliminary results show that depending on the concentration and on the cell line, EGCG could act as a radiation enhancer on cancerous cell lines.","['Baatout, Sarah', 'Jacquet, Paul', 'Derradji, Hanane', 'Ooms, Daniella', 'Michaux, Arlette', 'Mergeay, Max']","['Baatout S', 'Jacquet P', 'Derradji H', 'Ooms D', 'Michaux A', 'Mergeay M']","['Laboratory of Radiobiology, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, SCK-CEN, Mol, Belgium. sbaatout@sckcen.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'X-Rays']",,2004/06/18 05:00,2005/05/17 09:00,['2004/06/18 05:00'],"['2004/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2004 Jul;12(1):159-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five (56%) of 9 cases showed methylation of at least one gene.

Diets tested were commercially available formulas enriched either with soybean and omega-3 fatty acids or with casein. The soybean-containing diet offered significant protection against MTX toxicity in rats compared with the casein-containing diet, completely alleviating MTX-induced anorexia, diarrhea, and weight loss, when ingested as the sole diet and fed 7 days prior to and 7 days following intraperitoneal MTX injection. As a result, 90% of rats were alive on soybean-containing diet while all rats were dead on casein-containing diet. Histologic examination of the small intestine of MTX-treated rats revealed that the soybean-containing diet significantly prevented loss of mucosal villus tips compared to the casein-containing diet. Pharmocokinetic examination indicated that plasma MTX concentrations were similar for rats in the two diet-defined groups. No significant differences were observed between diets in survival of mice injected with L1210 mouse leukemia cells and subsequently with MTX. Thus the soybean-containing diet appeared to be superior to the casein-containing diet in preventing gastrointestinal toxicity while preserving antitumor activity. A soybean diet enriched in omega-3 fatty acids may be a useful adjunct to MTX treatment of human cancers.","['Mitsugi, Kenji', 'Nakamura, Tsuyoshi', 'Kashiwabara, Norio', 'Ariyama, Hiroshi', 'Tanaka, Risa', 'Baba, Eishi', 'Nakamura, Minoru', 'Harada, Mine', 'Nakano, Shuji']","['Mitsugi K', 'Nakamura T', 'Kashiwabara N', 'Ariyama H', 'Tanaka R', 'Baba E', 'Nakamura M', 'Harada M', 'Nakano S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, and Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Appetite/*drug effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Caseins', '*Diet', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Microvilli/drug effects/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Soybean Proteins/*therapeutic use', '*Soybeans']",,2004/06/18 05:00,2005/05/17 09:00,['2004/06/18 05:00'],"['2004/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2004 Jul;12(1):41-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to imatinib can arise by multiple mechanisms including amplification or mutation of Bcr-Abl, and continuity of imatinib therapy is probably a poor option for either of these patient groups. Recently, however, a structurally distinct new class of drugs, the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines, has been described, and these compounds are predicted to make different molecular contacts in the Abl kinase domain. These drugs potently target both the Bcr-Abl and Src-family kinase activities, both of which are thought to be relevant to survival of the leukemic cell. We asked whether these drugs could selectively induce cell death in murine cell line models of CML cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib by different mechanisms. We show that whereas the pyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidines are indeed highly potent in suppressing proliferation of Bcr-Abl-overexpressing imatinib-resistant cells, they are almost completely ineffective against cells expressing the T315I mutant. This implies that despite structural differences from imatinib, these drugs are unlikely to be useful in patients expressing this mutant Bcr-Abl protein, but may be effective in cases where selection of cells overexpressing the oncoprotein leads to refractoriness to imatinib.","['Tipping, A J', 'Baluch, S', 'Barnes, D J', 'Veach, D R', 'Clarkson, B M', 'Bornmann, W G', 'Mahon, F X', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Tipping AJ', 'Baluch S', 'Barnes DJ', 'Veach DR', 'Clarkson BM', 'Bornmann WG', 'Mahon FX', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2004/06/18 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/18 05:00'],"['2004/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403416 [doi]', '2403416 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1352-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403416.,,,,,"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

When compared for in vitro efficiency with conventionally used cytotoxic drugs, BA was more potent than nine out of 10 standard therapeutics and especially efficient in tumor relapse. No crossresistances were found between BA and any cytotoxic drug. Intracellular apoptosis signaling in leukemia tumor cells paralleled the pathway found in neuroectodermal cells involving caspases, but not death receptors. In isolated mitochondria, BA induced release of both cytochrome c and Smac. Taken together, BA potently induces apoptosis in leukemia cells and should be further evaluated as a future drug to treat leukemia.","['Ehrhardt, H', 'Fulda, S', 'Fuhrer, M', 'Debatin, K M', 'Jeremias, I']","['Ehrhardt H', 'Fulda S', 'Fuhrer M', 'Debatin KM', 'Jeremias I']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, Dr von Haunersches Kinderspital, Lindwurmstr 4, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/18 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/18 05:00'],"['2004/06/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403406 [doi]', '2403406 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1406-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MRD% in BM after the first cycle (n=51), second cycle (n=52) and third cycle (n=30), as well as in PBSC products (n=39) strongly correlated with relapse-free survival. At a cutoff level of 1% after the first cycle and median cutoff levels of 0.14% after the second, 0.11% after the third cycle and 0.13% for PBSC products, the relative risk of relapse was a factor 6.1, 3.4, 7.2 and 5.7, respectively, higher for patients in the high MRD group.

METHODS: The clinical data of 7 patients with myeloid diseases, 6 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and one with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), 4 males and 3 females, aged 51 - 74, were analyzed. Chromosome specimens were prepared by direct method and/or short-time culture of bone marrow cells. Karyotyping was performed by R banding technique. Two kinds of probes (20q subtelomere probe and 20q12 unique sequence probe) were used in dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) assay. RESULTS: Of the seven patients, 4 died and 3 survived by the end of this study. The patients survived for 6 months (case 1), 7 months (case 2), 17 days (case 4), and 28 days (case 5) respectively. Karyotype analysis showed that one of the normal chromosomes 20 was lost and substituted by one or two small metacentric isochromosomes smaller than the normal chromosome 20 in all these seven cases. It was proved to be ider(20)(q10) del(20)(q11q13), i(20q-) in six cases by D-FISH assay.

Azathioprine treatment is associated with adverse effects such as leukopenia and aplasia. These adverse effects are related to a single nucleotide polymorphism, including the inability of cells to synthesize thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT).

METHODS: One hundred and fourteen patients were randomly divided into the treated group (n = 68) and the control group (n = 46). To the treated group, SQNYCH was applied as the basic treatment, with combined chemotherapeutic protocol, using DA, HA and IA, to induce remission, and to the M3 patients, all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide were given. As for patients in the control group, only western medicine was administered. RESULTS: In the treated group 49 patients (72.1%) were completely remitted, 9 (13.2%) partially remitted and the total remission rate being 85.3%, which was significantly different from that in the control group. After treatment, the blood and bone marrow picture were obviously improved in both groups, but the increase of hemoglobin and platelet were better in the treated group than in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Immune functions were enhanced in both groups, but the elevation of CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio and NK cells were higher in the treated group than in the control group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01).

They have been implicated in the signaling pathways coupled to immunoreceptors such as the antigen receptors and Fc receptors. Previous studies using gene-targeted mice and deficient cell lines showed that SLP-76 plays a central role in T-cell development and activation. Moreover, it is essential for normal mast cell and platelet activation. In contrast, Blnk is necessary for B-cell development and activation. While the precise function of Clnk is not known, it was reported that Clnk is selectively expressed in mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and previously activated T-cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of Clnk was shown to rescue T-cell receptor-mediated signal transduction in an SLP-76-deficient T-cell line, suggesting that, like its relatives, Clnk is involved in the positive regulation of immunoreceptor signaling. Stimulatory effects of Clnk on immunoreceptor signaling were also reported to occur in transfected B-cell and basophil leukemia cell lines. Herein, we attempted to address the physiological role of Clnk in immune cells by the generation of Clnk-deficient mice. The results of our studies demonstrated that Clnk is dispensable for normal differentiation and function of T cells, mast cells, and NK cells. Hence, unlike its relatives, Clnk is not essential for normal immune functions.","['Utting, Oliver', 'Sedgmen, Bradley J', 'Watts, Tania H', 'Shi, Xiaoshu', 'Rottapel, Robert', 'Iulianella, Angelo', 'Lohnes, David', 'Veillette, Andre']","['Utting O', 'Sedgmen BJ', 'Watts TH', 'Shi X', 'Rottapel R', 'Iulianella A', 'Lohnes D', 'Veillette A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H2W 1R7.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Clnk protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (SLP-76 signal Transducing adaptor proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immune System/*cytology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Mast Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",,2004/06/17 05:00,2004/08/05 05:00,['2004/06/17 05:00'],"['2004/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.13.6067-6075.2004 [doi]', '24/13/6067 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jul;24(13):6067-75. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.13.6067-6075.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC480883,,,,,,,,,

Its product, a homolog of Drosophila melanogaster trithorax, displays intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity and functions genetically to maintain embryonic Hox gene expression. Here we report the biochemical purification of MLL and demonstrate that it associates with a cohort of proteins shared with the yeast and human SET1 histone methyltransferase complexes, including a homolog of Ash2, another Trx-G group protein. Two other members of the novel MLL complex identified here are host cell factor 1 (HCF-1), a transcriptional coregulator, and the related HCF-2, both of which specifically interact with a conserved binding motif in the MLL(N) (p300) subunit of MLL and provide a potential mechanism for regulating its antagonistic transcriptional properties. Menin, a product of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, is also a component of the 1-MDa MLL complex. Abrogation of menin expression phenocopies loss of MLL and reveals a critical role for menin in the maintenance of Hox gene expression. Oncogenic mutant forms of MLL retain an ability to interact with menin but not other identified complex components.

As we know, few studies have dealt with the distribution of oligoclonal T cells in leukemia, so we investigated the distribution and clonality of TCR Vbeta repertoire of T cells in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. METHODS: The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of TCR Vbeta24 subfamily genes were amplified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 27 cases with CML using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In order to observe the distribution of TCR Vbeta repertoire, the PCR products were further analyzed by genescan technique to evaluate clonality of the detectable TCR Vbeta T cells. The PCR products of the oligoclonal T cells from three cases were analyzed by direct sequencing to define the sequence of CDR3. RESULTS: The expression pattern of TCR Vbeta repertoire in different individuals are different. Vbeta2-21 subfamilies could be detected in CML cases. The frequent usage Vbeta repertoire in CML was Vbeta1, Vbeta2 or Vbeta13. Most of the PCR products from 27 patients displayed polyclonality, while a part of the PCR products from 21 out of 27 samples displayed clonal expansion pattern. The clonal expanded T cells in CML could be found in Vbeta16 subfamilies. The frequent usage of Vbeta genes in clonal expansion was Vbeta3, Vbeta13 or Vbeta21. Multiple Vbeta clonal expansion was a general phenomenon in the same patient. The CDR3 sequence of Vbeta21 oligoclonal T cells from 3 cases showed some difference in splice regions and in the usage of J segments. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that clonal expanded T cells could be found in patients with CML and were tendentious in Vbeta3, Vbeta13 and Vbeta21 subfamilies that may be related to the specific immune response for leukemia cell associated antigen.","['Li, Yang-qiu', 'Yang, Li-jian', 'Chen, Shao-hua', 'Zhang, Yu-ping', 'Zhang, Xue-li', 'Luo, Geng-xin']","['Li YQ', 'Yang LJ', 'Chen SH', 'Zhang YP', 'Zhang XL', 'Luo GX']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",,2004/06/17 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/06/17 05:00'],"['2004/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 Jun;117(6):840-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, clonal haemopoiesis may develop following stem cell transplantation and precede the development of t-AML/MDS. Moreover, accelerated telomere shortening may be induced by replicative stress or oxidative damage, leading to genomic instability, and inactivating polymorphisms of the gene encoding NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) are more frequently observed in patients with t-AML. We studied clonal haemopoiesis, telomere length and NQO1 status in 146 patients receiving conventional chemotherapy for non-myeloid malignancies. Clonal haemopoiesis was demonstrated in eight of 98 (8%) patients. Telomere length was reduced in patients following chemotherapy (n = 52) compared with controls (n = 42) (P < 0.001), particularly in those with clonal haemopoiesis (P < 0.002). Whilst there was a trend towards telomere shortening in control subjects polymorphic for NQO1-187Ser (n = 12), chemotherapy-exposed patients polymorphic for the NQO1-187Ser allele (n = 29) had significantly shorter telomeres (P < 0.001). Furthermore, chemotherapy-treated patients with the NQO1-187Ser, polymorphism were more likely to develop clonal haemopoiesis than patients with wild type NQO1 (odds ratio = 7; 1.16-42.6). We conclude that a switch to clonal haemopoiesis may occur after conventional chemotherapy and lead to accelerated telomere shortening. Patients with the NQO1-187Ser polymorphism have an increased risk of developing both clonal haemopoiesis and telomere shortening, which may partly explain the predisposition to t-AML in NQO1-187Ser null individuals.","['Fern, Lorna', 'Pallis, Monica', 'Ian Carter, G', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Byrne, Jennifer']","['Fern L', 'Pallis M', 'Ian Carter G', 'Seedhouse C', 'Russell N', 'Byrne J']","['Division of Haematology, School of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Nottingham, and Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hodgkin Disease/surgery', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/surgery', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",,2004/06/17 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2004/06/17 05:00'],"['2004/06/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05006.x [doi]', 'BJH5006 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Jul;126(1):63-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05006.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the methylation of known and putative TSGs in monoclonal gammopathies. Thus, the authors investigated the methylation frequencies of 10 genes in patients with monoclonal gammopathies. METHODS: The methylation patterns of the genes p16(INK4a) (p16), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), p15(INK4b) (p15), E-cadherin (ECAD), death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), p73, RAS-association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), p14, O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and retinoid acid receptor beta2 (RARbeta) were determined in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS; n = 29), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM; n = 5), multiple myeloma (MM; n = 113), or plasma cell leukemia (PCL; n = 7) by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Methylation frequencies for p16, TIMP3, p15, ECAD, DAPK, p73, RASSF1A, p14, MGMT, and RARbeta were as follows: 28%, 35%, 10%, 0%, 17%, 21%, 14%, 14%, 7%, and 0%, respectively, in patients with MGUS and 36%, 29%, 27%, 27%, 22%, 15%, 15%, 9%, 4%, and 0%, respectively, in patients with MM. Methylation of at least 1 of these genes was detected in 79% of patients with MGUS and in 80% of patients with MM. Although methylation of ECAD was not detected in patients with MGUS, it was observed frequently in patients with MM and with even greater frequency in patients with PCL. It is noteworthy that an association was found between ECAD methylation and poor prognostic markers in patients with MM. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of certain genes can be detected frequently in patients with monoclonal gammopathies. The current data suggest that methylation of ECAD is a marker of disease progression in patients with MM and PCL.","['Seidl, Sonja', 'Ackermann, Jutta', 'Kaufmann, Hannes', 'Keck, Andrea', 'Nosslinger, Thomas', 'Zielinski, Christoph C', 'Drach, Johannes', 'Zochbauer-Muller, Sabine']","['Seidl S', 'Ackermann J', 'Kaufmann H', 'Keck A', 'Nosslinger T', 'Zielinski CC', 'Drach J', 'Zochbauer-Muller S']","['Clinical Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, University Hospital, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cadherins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cadherins/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20295 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Jun 15;100(12):2598-606. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20295.,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the safety profile of imatinib is favorable, Grade > or = 3 neutropenia (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) occurs in 35-45% of patients with CML in chronic phase who receive standard-dose imatinib. Myelosuppression results in treatment interruptions, which may compromise responses to imatinib. The authors investigated the ability of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) to reverse imatinib-associated neutropenia, thereby allowing for more continuous imatinib administration. METHODS: Thirteen patients with chronic-phase CML and Grade > or = 3, imatinib-induced neutropenia were treated with filgrastim. Treatment with filgrastim was initiated after a median of 22 months from the start of imatinib. Eleven patients received filgrastim 5 microg/kg 1-3 times weekly, and 2 patients received filgrastim 5 microg/kg daily; doses were titrated to maintain an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > or = 10(9)/L. RESULTS: Seven of 11 patients (64%) who began treatment with an ANC < 1.5 x 10(9)/L had responses (i.e., their ANC improved to > or = 2 x 10(9)/L within 21 days); the other 4 patients experienced slower recovery but were able to continue receiving imatinib uninterrupted. Before filgrastim administration was initiated, patients did not receive imatinib (due to neutropenia-related treatment interruptions) for an average of 21% of the total time since the start of imatinib. This figure decreased to 6% after the start of filgrastim treatment (P = 0.0008). Before filgrastim treatment was initiated, only one patient had achieved a major (partial) cytogenetic response. After the start of filgrastim treatment, five patients had major cytogenetic responses (including two complete responses). CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that filgrastim may overcome imatinib-associated neutropenia and allow improved delivery of imatinib. Some patients may experience improvements in their responses to therapy as a result.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Rios, Mary B', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Rios MB', 'Talpaz M', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: Eighty-eight patients were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 3 days and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2) on Day 1 (FN). Patients were divided into four groups based on expected response to single-agent fludarabine. These four groups included previously untreated patients, patients who previously were treated with alkylating agents, patients who were successfully treated with alkylating agents and fludarabine but who developed recurrent disease, and patients whose disease was refractory to fludarabine with or without alkylating agents. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 66%. The response rates were 83% in previously untreated patients, 87% in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, 50% in patients whose disease was not refractory to fludarabine at the start of therapy, and 25% in patients whose disease was refractory to fludarabine. The complete remission (CR) rate was 20% for previously untreated patients, which was not significantly different from the CR rate for a group of historical control patients who were treated with single-agent fludarabine. The median follow-up was 8 years for surviving patients. The median progression free survival was 24 months for all patients and 34 months for previously untreated patients. The median overall survival was 40 months, and the median survival of previously untreated patients was 88 months. The most common toxicities were myelosuppression and infection. Eleven patients (12.5%) developed a second malignancy after a median of 62 months.

Earlier results concerning cancers other than lung cancer are scarce and inconsistent, and exposure-response relations have seldom been reported. We followed up a cohort of all economically active Finns born between 1906 and 1945 for 30 million person-years during 1971-1995. Incident cases of esophageal cancer (n = 2,198), ovarian cancer (5,082), testicular cancer (387), kidney cancer (7,366), bladder cancer (8,110) and leukemia (4,562) were identified through a record linkage with the Finnish Cancer Registry. Occupations from the population census in 1970 were converted to exposures to diesel and gasoline engine exhausts with a job-exposure matrix (FINJEM). Cumulative exposure (CE) was calculated as product of prevalence, level and estimated duration of exposure. The relative risk (RR) of cancer for exposure categories in relation to the unexposed group was calculated using the Poisson regression model and adjusted for confounders. An increasing RR for ovarian cancer was observed with the increasing CE of diesel exhaust (p for trend = 0.006). The RR in the highest CE category was 3.69 (95% CI = 1.38-9.86). For gasoline engine exhaust, the RR was significantly increased only in the middle CE category (1.70; 95% CI = 1.11-2.62). Slight elevations of RR for bladder and kidney cancers were found at the lowest exposure level of engine exhausts, largely attributable to drivers. No effect of the exposures was observed for the other cancers. This study suggests an exposure-response relation between diesel exhaust and ovarian cancer.","['Guo, Johannes', 'Kauppinen, Timo', 'Kyyronen, Pentti', 'Heikkila, Pirjo', 'Lindbohm, Marja-Liisa', 'Pukkala, Eero']","['Guo J', 'Kauppinen T', 'Kyyronen P', 'Heikkila P', 'Lindbohm ML', 'Pukkala E']","['Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland. johannes.guo@medivire.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Gasoline)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Gasoline/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Vehicle Emissions/*adverse effects']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/08/06 05:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20263 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Aug 20;111(2):286-92. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20263.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blot analysis of patients (n = 30) showed that 3 ALL-specific 9-O-AcSGs (90, 120 and 135 kDa) were induced at presentation; all these bands disappeared after treatment in patients (n = 22) who had disease-free survival. The 90 kDa band persisted in 8 patients who subsequently relapsed with reexpression of the 120 kDa band. FACS analysis revealed that at presentation (n = 70) 90.1 +/- 5.0% cells expressed 9-O-AcSGs, which decreased progressively with chemotherapy, remained <5% during clinical remission and reappeared in relapse (80 +/- 10%, n = 18). Early clearance of 9-O-AcSG(+) cells, during 4-8 weeks of treatment showed a good correlation with low risk of relapse. Sensitivity of detection of 9-O-AcSG(+) cells was 0.1%. Numbers of both high- and low-affinity binding sites were maximum at presentation, decreased with treatment and increased again in clinical relapse. We propose that close monitoring of 90 and 120 kDa 9-O-AcSGs may serve as a reliable index for long-term management of childhood ALL and merits therapeutic consideration.","['Pal, Santanu', 'Ghosh, Shyamasree', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Mandal, Chhabinath', 'Bandhyopadhyay, Santu', 'Kumar Bhattacharya, Dilip', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Pal S', 'Ghosh S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Mandal C', 'Bandhyopadhyay S', 'Kumar Bhattacharya D', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycoconjugates/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acids/*biosynthesis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/08/06 05:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20246 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Aug 20;111(2):270-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20246.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of CHS 828 on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) because of its well-known role in the control of cell division and apoptosis. CHS 828 is able to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear localization as well as the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B in human THP-1 leukemia cells. Moreover, CHS 828 has also been shown to inhibit the LPS-induced degradation of the I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta in THP-1 cells, leading us to identify the I kappa B kinase complex as a molecular target of CHS 828. The IKK activity is inhibited by CHS 828 with an IC(50) of 8 nM. The inhibition of the IKK activity by different CHS 828 analogues correlates well with the inhibition of NYH small cell lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the inhibition of NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in different cancer cell lines by CHS 828 correlates to some extent with the reduction by CHS 828 of the size of the corresponding xenografts. Activation of NF-kappa B has been shown to induce expression of antiapoptotic proteins, and cancer cells have been shown to have high levels of constitutively active NF-kappa B. Therefore, we hypothesize that the anticancer activity of CHS 828 is due to inhibition of the IKK activity by which the antiapoptotic protection of NF-kappa B is removed, leading to the promotion of apoptosis.","['Olsen, Lone Stengelshoj', 'Hjarnaa, Pernille-Julia Vig', 'Latini, Scilla', 'Holm, Pernille Kaae', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Bramm, Erik', 'Binderup, Lise', 'Madsen, Mogens Winkel']","['Olsen LS', 'Hjarnaa PJ', 'Latini S', 'Holm PK', 'Larsson R', 'Bramm E', 'Binderup L', 'Madsen MW']","['LEO Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cyanides)', '0 (Guanidines)', ""0 (N-(6-chlorophenoxyhexyl)-N''-cyano-N''-4-pyridylguanidine)"", '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Chuk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (Ikbke protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyanides/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Guanidines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/08/06 05:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20255 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Aug 20;111(2):198-205. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20255.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase-3 activity in cell extracts and flow cytometry of annexin V-labeled cells. In parallel, necrosis was estimated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase. Minor effects on cell death were observed when Jurkat cells were incubated with either DHA alone (100-1,000 microM) or a single dose of 10 microM H(2)O(2). However, pre-incubation with DHA followed by exposure to H(2)O(2) clearly stimulated both apoptosis and necrosis. In complete contrast, pre-incubation of cells with DHA significantly inhibited apoptosis, but did not affect necrosis, induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. Our results indicate that intracellular ascorbate can modulate cell death in a manner which depends upon the nature of the apoptotic stimulus, which in turn has critical implications regarding the mechanism and potential application of ascorbate in cancer therapy.","['Sane, Alain-Theophile', 'Cantin, Andre M', 'Paquette, Benoit', 'Wagner, J Richard']","['Sane AT', 'Cantin AM', 'Paquette B', 'Wagner JR']","[""Centre de recherche sur le vieillissement, Institut Universitaire de Geriatrie de Sherbrooke, Pavillion d'Youville, 1036 rue Belvedere Sud, J1H 4C4, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'Y2Z3ZTP9UM (Dehydroascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/*metabolism', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Dehydroascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/10/20 09:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2003/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0828-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Oct;54(4):315-21. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0828-8.

In addition to causing DNA damage, irradiation initiates a plethora of signal transduction cascades responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting interactions with neighboring cells. Large-scale changes in gene expression have also been found after irradiation, and microarrays have helped discern these subsequent transcriptional alterations. While some studies have focused on low dose-rate experiments, others have analyzed the gene expression response of IR compared to other DNA damaging agents. Very few genes have been found to be consistently up-regulated by IR, but that set includes GADD45, CDKN1A, and genes associated with the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Overall, the immediate transcriptional responses to IR have implications for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, growth control, and cell signaling. Additionally, there is a substantial p53-independent component to the transcriptional profile that could be exploited to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Initial characterizations of the persistent responses to IR yielded a completely different profile than observed immediately after exposure. This profile is ephemeral, shifting even over the course of one set of experiments. Microarray analysis of radiation responses has also been applied to clinical response to radiotherapy, identifying genes linked to radio-sensitivity and resistance in B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia and cervical cancer. Overall, these large-scale gene expression studies have added to the understanding of the complicated biological responses to IR, and when combined with other data sets will yield a complete picture of the short and long-term consequences of radiation.","['Snyder, Andrew R', 'Morgan, William F']","['Snyder AR', 'Morgan WF']","['Molecular and Cell Biology Graduate Program, Radiation Oncology Research Laboratory, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA. asnyd002@umaryland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage/genetics/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/radiotherapy', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",50,2004/06/16 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/B:CANC.0000031765.17886.fa [doi]', '5273263 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004 Aug-Dec;23(3-4):259-68. doi: 10.1023/B:CANC.0000031765.17886.fa.,,,,,['CA73924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, three leukemic cell lines were investigated: Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 (two acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines carrying the (8;21)-chromosomal translocation, resulting in the expression of the leukemia-specific fusion protein AML1-eight-twenty-one) and REH, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line with the (12;21)-chromosomal translocation and expression of translocation ETS-like leukemia-AML1. These fusion proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of the leukemic state by recruiting corepressors and histone deacetylases (HDAC), which interfere with normal cell differentiation. In vitro generation of DC was achieved using a cytokine cocktail containing tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, c-kit ligand, and soluble CD40 ligand; yet, addition of the HDAC inhibitor (Hdi) trichostatin A enhanced DC differentiation with retention of the fusion transcripts. These leukemic DC showed high-level CD83 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression and had a high allostimulatory potential. Only DC generated from these cell lines after Hdi induced blast-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in HLA-A-matched T cells with a cytotoxicity of 42% in parental Kasumi-1 and 83% in parental REH cells, respectively.

Recently, Cheson et al suggested using cytogenetic remission (CRc) as part of the criteria for CR. To our knowledge, ours is the first relatively large study evaluating the usefulness of CRc attained immediately following induction chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included AML patients treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B front-line studies with cytogenetic samples obtained at diagnosis and at the first day of documented CR following induction. Patients with abnormal cytogenetics at diagnosis, and normal cytogenetics at CR (NCR; n = 103) were compared with those with abnormal cytogenetics both at diagnosis and at CR (ACR; n = 15) for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). Cox proportional hazards models determined the prognostic significance of cytogenetics at CR, adjusting for other covariates. RESULTS: Clinical features were similar for both groups, with the exception of favorable cytogenetics [t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), t(15;17)] at diagnosis, which was more frequent (P =.03) in the NCR group. Median follow-up was 3.1 years (range, 1.0 to 11.4 years). ACR patients had significantly shorter OS (P =.006) and DFS (P =.0001), and higher CIR (P =.0001). In multivariable models, the NCR and ACR groups were predictors for OS (P =.03), DFS (P =.02), and CIR (P =.05). The relative risk of relapse or death was 2.1 times higher for ACR patients than for NCR patients (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.9). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that converting to normal karyotype at the time of first CR is an important prognostic indicator and support the use of CRc as a criterion of CR in AML.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Archer, Kellie J', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Koduru, Prasad R K', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Sterling, Lisa J', 'Edwards, Colin G', 'Anastasi, John', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Mrozek K', 'Ruppert AS', 'Archer KJ', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Koduru PR', 'Kolitz JE', 'Sterling LJ', 'Edwards CG', 'Anastasi J', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. marcucci-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.03.023 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.03.023 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jun 15;22(12):2410-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.03.023.,,,,,"['CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA90469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, Ipaf may contribute to modulate the response of myeloid cells to genotoxic and pro-inflammatory stimuli.","['Gutierrez, Olga', 'Pipaon, Carlos', 'Fernandez-Luna, Jose L']","['Gutierrez O', 'Pipaon C', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Unidad de Genetica Molecular, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Edificio Escuela Universitaria de Enfermeria, Av.

Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a T cell activator, significantly enhanced the expression of EP4 receptor mRNA during the first 3-6 h of exposure, after which, expression gradually declined. Furthermore, PHA stimulation slightly but significantly up-regulated the expression of EP2 mRNA after 12 h and of EP3 mRNA after 6 h. By contrast, expression level of EP1 receptor mRNA was not affected by PHA. ONO-4819 (1 microM), which was added to cultures after 3 h of PHA stimulation, significantly increased cellular ACh content and release, and up-regulated ChAT mRNA expression and activity but inhibited MOLT-3 cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the activation of T lymphocytes up-regulates EP4 receptor mRNA expression and, to a lesser extent, EP2 and EP3 receptors and that PGE2 enhances nonneuronal lymphocytic cholinergic transmission in activated T cells, at least in part, via EP4 receptor-mediated pathways.","['Suenaga, Aya', 'Fujii, Takeshi', 'Ogawa, Hiroshi', 'Maruyama, Takayuki', 'Ohuchida, Shuichi', 'Katsube, Nobuo', 'Obata, Takaaki', 'Kawashima, Koichiro']","['Suenaga A', 'Fujii T', 'Ogawa H', 'Maruyama T', 'Ohuchida S', 'Katsube N', 'Obata T', 'Kawashima K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Vascul Pharmacol,Vascular pharmacology,101130615,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (ONO4819)', '0 (PTGER4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholine/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Heptanoates/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E/*agonists/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects/physiology']",,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.vph.2004.03.006 [doi]', 'S1537189104000606 [pii]']",ppublish,Vascul Pharmacol. 2004 Mar;41(2):51-8. doi: 10.1016/j.vph.2004.03.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia represents 22-30% of all leukaemia cases with a worldwide incidence projected to be between < 1 and 5.5 per 100,000 people. Australia, the USA, Ireland and Italy have the highest CLL incidence rates. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presents in adults, at higher rates in males than in females and in whites than in blacks. Median age at diagnosis is 64-70 years. Five-year survival rate in the USA is 83% for those < 65 years old and 68% for those 65 + years old. Hereditary and genetic links have been noted. Persons with close relatives who have CLL have an increased risk of developing it themselves. No single environmental risk factor has been found to be predictive for CLL. Patients are usually diagnosed at routine health care visits because of elevated lymphocyte counts. The most common presenting symptom of CLL is lymphadenopathy, while difficulty exercising and fatigue are common complaints. Most patients do not receive treatment after initial diagnosis unless presenting with clear pathologic conditions. Pharmacological therapy may consist of monotherapy or combination therapy involving glucocorticoids, alkylating agents, and purine analogs. Fludarabine may be the most effective single drug treatment currently available. Combination therapy protocols have not been shown to be more effective than fludarabine alone. As no cure is yet available, a strong unmet medical need exists for innovative new therapies. Experimental treatments under development include allogeneic stem cell transplant, mini-allogeneic transplants, and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. alemtuzumab against CD52; rituximab against CD20).","['Redaelli, A', 'Laskin, B L', 'Stephens, J M', 'Botteman, M F', 'Pashos, C L']","['Redaelli A', 'Laskin BL', 'Stephens JM', 'Botteman MF', 'Pashos CL']","['Global Outcomes Research-Oncology, Pharmacia Corporation, Milan, Italy. alberto.radaelli@nervianoms.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",29,2004/06/16 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/06/16 05:00'],"['2004/06/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2354.2004.00489.x [doi]', 'ECC489 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2004 Jul;13(3):279-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2354.2004.00489.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML was recently shown to interact with the p53 ubiquitin-ligase Mdm2 (refs 4-6); however, the mechanism by which PML regulates Mdm2 remains unclear. Here, we show that PML enhances p53 stability by sequestering Mdm2 to the nucleolus. We found that after DNA damage, PML and Mdm2 accumulate in the nucleolus in an Arf-independent manner. In addition, we found that the nucleolar localization of PML is dependent on ATR activation and phosphorylation of PML by ATR. Notably, in Pml(-/-) cells, sequestration of Mdm2 to the nucleolus was impaired, as well as p53 stabilization and the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PML physically associates with the nucleolar protein L11, and that L11 knockdown impairs the ability of PML to localize to nucleoli after DNA damage. These findings demonstrate an unexpected role of PML in the nucleolar network for tumour suppression.","['Bernardi, Rosa', 'Scaglioni, Pier Paolo', 'Bergmann, Stephan', 'Horn, Henning F', 'Vousden, Karen H', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Bernardi R', 'Scaglioni PP', 'Bergmann S', 'Horn HF', 'Vousden KH', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Department of Pathology and Medicine, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein L11)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Atr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Compartmentation/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleolus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA Stability/genetics', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ncb1147 [doi]', 'ncb1147 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2004 Jul;6(7):665-72. doi: 10.1038/ncb1147.

However, coexpression of a given glycoprotein with heterologous core proteins does not always give rise to highly infectious viral particles, and restrictions on pseudotype formation have been reported. To understand the mechanisms that control the recruitment of viral surface glycoproteins on lentiviral and retroviral cores, we exploited the fact that the feline endogenous retrovirus RD114 glycoprotein does not efficiently pseudotype lentiviral cores derived from simian immunodeficiency virus, whereas it is readily incorporated onto MLV particles. Our results indicate that recruitment of glycoproteins by the MLV and lentiviral core proteins occurs in intracellular compartments and not at the cell surface. We found that Env and core protein colocalization in intracytoplasmic vesicles is required for pseudotype formation. By investigating MLV/RD114 Env chimeras, we show that signals in the cytoplasmic tail of either glycoprotein differentially influenced their intracellular localization; that of MLV allows endosomal localization and hence recruitment by both lentiviral and MLV cores. Furthermore, we found that upon membrane binding, MLV core proteins could relocalize Env glycoproteins in late endosomes and allow their incorporation on viral particles. Thus, intracellular colocalization, as well as interactions between Env and core proteins, may influence the recruitment of the glycoprotein onto viral particles and generate infectious pseudotyped viruses.","['Sandrin, Virginie', 'Muriaux, Delphine', 'Darlix, Jean-Luc', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic']","['Sandrin V', 'Muriaux D', 'Darlix JL', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, INSERM U412, IFR128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, Ecole Normal Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.13.7153-7164.2004 [doi]', '78/13/7153 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jul;78(13):7153-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.13.7153-7164.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC421692,,,,,,,,,

Tax activates viral transcription through interaction with the cellular transcription factor CREB and the coactivators CBP/p300. In this study, we have analyzed the role of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) on HTLV-1 gene expression from an integrated template. First we show that trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, enhances Tax expression in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Second, using a cell line containing a single-copy HTLV-1 long terminal repeat, we demonstrate that overexpression of HDAC1 represses Tax transactivation. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay allowed us to analyze the interaction of transcription factors, coactivators, and HDACs with the basal and activated HTLV-1 promoter. We demonstrate that HDAC1 is associated with the inactive, but not the Tax-transactivated, HTLV-1 promoter. In vitro and in vivo glutathione S-transferase-Tax pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that there is a direct physical association between Tax and HDAC1. Importantly, biotinylated chromatin pull-down assays demonstrated that Tax inhibits and/or dissociates the binding of HDAC1 to the HTLV-1 promoter. Our results provide evidence that Tax interacts directly with HDAC1 and regulates binding of the repressor to the HTLV-1 promoter.","['Lu, Hanxin', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Linton, Rebecca', 'Park, Hyeon Ung', 'Schiltz, R Louis', 'Sartorelli, Vittorio', 'Brady, John N']","['Lu H', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Linton R', 'Park HU', 'Schiltz RL', 'Sartorelli V', 'Brady JN']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatin', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.13.6735-6743.2004 [doi]', '78/13/6735 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jul;78(13):6735-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.13.6735-6743.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC421680,,,,,,,,,

The name reflects its close relationship to gp130, the common receptor subunit of the interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines. Indeed, the recently proposed ligand for GPL, IL-31, is closely related to the IL-6-type cytokines oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, and cardiotrophin-1. The second signal transducing receptor for IL-31 seems to be the oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRbeta). The present study characterizes in depth the molecular mechanisms underlying GPL-mediated signal transduction. GPL is a strong activator of STAT3 and STAT5, whereas STAT1 is only marginally tyrosine-phosphorylated. We identify tyrosine residues 652 and 721 in the cytoplasmic region of the longest isoform of GPL (GPL(745)) as the major STAT5- and STAT3-activating sites, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate Jak1 binding to GPL and its activation in heteromeric complexes with the OSMRbeta but also in a homomeric receptor complex. Most interesting, unlike OSMRbeta and gp130, GPL is insufficient to mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We propose that this is due to a lack of recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 or the adaptor protein Shc to the cytoplasmic domain of GPL.","['Dreuw, Alexandra', 'Radtke, Simone', 'Pflanz, Stefan', 'Lippok, Barbara E', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Hermanns, Heike M']","['Dreuw A', 'Radtke S', 'Pflanz S', 'Lippok BE', 'Heinrich PC', 'Hermanns HM']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Universitatsklinikum der Rheinisch-Westfalischen Technischen Hochschule Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cytokine receptor, GLM-R)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M401122200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)73199-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 20;279(34):36112-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M401122200.

The 14q32 breakpoints are heterogeneous. Because the t(5;14)(q35;q32) is hard to detect using conventional karyotyping, it is easily missed in routine diagnostics. Here we describe the development and application of split signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays for both HOX11L2 and CSX, for detection of t(5;14) possibly present in T-ALL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed and validated two split signal FISH assays for metaphase and interphase detection of t(5;14) in T-ALL patients. We also investigated the involvement of IGH on 14q32. In addition, HOX11L2 and SIL-TAL1 expression was studied using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The FISH assays were validated on cell lines and T-ALL patients. We did not identify cases with a t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving CSX, but we did identify 5 cases of t(5;14) involving HOX11L2 out of 32 T-ALL cases studied; in each case the 14q32 breakpoint was found to be centromeric to the IGH region. All 5 positive cases showed HOX11L2 expression, as did 1 case without t(5;14)(q35;q32). Cases with t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving HOX11L2 did not show TAL1 abnormalities, whereas 5 HOX11L2 negative cases did. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Using the newly developed and validated FISH probe sets, we identified 5 new cases of t(5;14) involving HOX11L2 both on metaphases and interphases. The incidence of the t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving CSX is probably low. RT-PCR results suggest that TAL1 and HOX11L2 expression, or TAL1 aberrations and the t(5;14)(q35;q32) involving HOX11L2 are mutually exclusive.","['van Zutven, Laura J C M', 'Velthuizen, Sandra C J M', 'Wolvers-Tettero, Ingrid L M', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Poulsen, Tim S', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['van Zutven LJ', 'Velthuizen SC', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Poulsen TS', 'MacLeod RA', 'Beverloo HB', 'Langerak AW']","['Department of Genetics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (NKX2-5 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Female', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Jun;89(6):671-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Processing of pro-caspases 3, 8, and 9 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bid was determined by Western blotting. UV-C irradiation of Jurkat cells resulted in characteristic apoptosis within 6 h after treatment and pretreatment of cells with ZVAD blocked these features. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with the more selective caspase inhibitors under conditions that effectively blocked DNA degradation and inhibited caspase 3 and 8 processing as well as Bid cleavage had little protective effect on the other apoptotic characteristics examined. Thus, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are activated during UV-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells and this redundancy appears to assure cell death during selective caspase inhibition.","['Scoltock, Alyson B', 'Cidlowski, John A']","['Scoltock AB', 'Cidlowski JA']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology/*radiation effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Size/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/physiology/radiation effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology/radiation effects', 'Mitochondria/physiology/radiation effects', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Signal Transduction/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Sodium/metabolism', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2003/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.025 [doi]', 'S0014482704001156 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Jul 1;297(1):212-23. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being the product of a proto-oncogene, one would expect c-Myb function to be modulated by signal transduction pathways, but our knowledge on such regulation of c-Myb is rather limited. Recently, we and others showed that c-Myb is subjected to sumoylation and that this posttranslational modification has considerable effect on c-Myb's activity. Interestingly, many proteins subjected to SUMO-1 conjugation associate with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and localize to PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Although the precise molecular function of PML NBs still remains to be defined, they seem to play a role in regulation of gene expression and are linked to specific cellular signaling. We show here that c-Myb localizes to PML NBs and that c-Myb interacts with PML as judged by immunofluorescence microcopy and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Enforced expression of PML IV was shown to enhance c-Myb-dependent reporter activation. Our results imply a role for PML and possibly other components of PML NBs in regulating c-Myb's activity. This novel link between c-Myb and PML, two gene products being implicated in leukemic disorders, suggests that previously unknown mechanisms for regulating c-Myb's activity involving PML may exist.","['Dahle, Oyvind', 'Bakke, Oddmund', 'Gabrielsen, Odd Stokke']","['Dahle O', 'Bakke O', 'Gabrielsen OS']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Oslo, Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.014 [doi]', 'S001448270400120X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Jul 1;297(1):118-26. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.03.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood lymphocytes of LE-patients, and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry and direct immunofluorescence technique. Patients were treated with low-dose methotrexate (MTX). Before and during MTX treatment laboratory monitoring has been done. LE-patients had increased percentages of CD5+CD19+ as compared to controls (p < 0.0002), the absolute number of CD5+ B-cells was equal in controls and patients. Autoantibodies were positively correlated to the number of CD5+ B-cells in LE-patients. In a total of 140 LE-patients one male patient suffered from both LE and B-CLL (0.7%). He had increased absolute and relative CD5+ B-cells. MTX induced significant decrease of both total B-cell numbers, and CD5+ B-cells. The decrease of CD5+CD19+ cells was more pronounced than the decrease of total B-cells. Apoptosis rate increased in parallel to the drop-down of elevated CD5+CD19+ cells. Peripheral T-cell subsets remained stable under low-dose MTX. Both absolute and relative numbers of CD5+CD19+ cells should be taken into account in patients with LE. MTX seems to decrease B-cells, and preferentially to down-regulate B-cells expressing the CD5 molecule, which opens new therapeutic options and cell biological activities.

Though it was previously reported that LMB induces cell cycle arrest and p53-mediated apoptosis in certain cancer cells, however, the mechanism by which LMB induces apoptosis remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by LMB in U937 cells. Treatment with LMB concentration-dependently induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in U937 cells that correlated temporally with activation of caspases and down-regulation of Mcl-1 and XIAP. LMB did not change the expressions of Bcl-2 or Bax. A broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, blocked caspase-3 activation and elevated the survival in LMB-treated U937 cells, suggesting that caspase-3 activation is critical for LMB-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, Bcl-2 overexpression that blocked cytochrome c release by LMB effectively attenuated the apoptotic response to LMB, suggesting that LMB-induced apoptosis is mediated through the mitochondrial pathway. Antioxidants or antioxidant enzymes had no effects on LMB-induced apoptosis. Data of flow cytometry analysis using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate further revealed no reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by LMB, indicating that apoptosis induced by LMB is ROS-independent. However, the apoptotic response to LMB was not shown in U937 cells pretreated with the sulfhydryl group-containing antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further analysis suggested that NAC directly binds LMB and abolishes the apoptotic effects of LMB. Collectively, these findings suggest that LMB potently induces apoptosis in U937 cells, and LMB-induced apoptosis in U937 cells is related with cytochrome c release, activation of caspases, and selective down-regulation of Mcl-1 and XIAP.","['Jang, Byeong-Churl', 'Paik, Ji-Hye', 'Jeong, Hye-Yun', 'Oh, Hyun-Ji', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Song, Dae-Kyu', 'Park, Jong-Gu', 'Kim, Sang-Pyo', 'Bae, Jae-Hoon', 'Mun, Kyo-Chul', 'Suh, Min-Ho', 'Yoshida, Minoru', 'Suh, Seong-Il']","['Jang BC', 'Paik JH', 'Jeong HY', 'Oh HJ', 'Park JW', 'Kwon TK', 'Song DK', 'Park JG', 'Kim SP', 'Bae JH', 'Mun KC', 'Suh MH', 'Yoshida M', 'Suh SI']","['Chronic Disease Research Center and Institute for Medical Science, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Jung-gu, Daegu 700-712, South Korea. jangbc12@kmu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (immunosuppressive acidic protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2004/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.03.007 [doi]', 'S0006295204001832 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Jul 15;68(2):263-74. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.03.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The particles were compared with similarly produced wild-type virions, some of which had been exposed to a monoclonal antibody against the surface component of the envelope protein (SU protein). The env(-) particles generally exhibit a distinctly different external appearance suggesting only a low density of associated proteins that have an almost fluid, mechanically unstable character. The weakly associated proteins may be host cell membrane proteins that are incorporated into the viral membrane in place of or in addition to virus envelope protein. The amount of this non-viral protein on virion surfaces appears to vary from negligible in most cases to a substantial complement in others. It seems clear that the presence of the envelope protein, in a mechanical sense, significantly strengthens and stabilizes the virion envelope. Binding of monoclonal antibody to wild-type virions indicates that some particles expose a significant amount of antigen while adjacent virions may not. This suggests that the conformation of the envelope glycoprotein or the disposition of oligosaccharides may be different among particles, on some virions exposing the specific epitope, and others little or none.","['Kuznetsov, Y G', 'Low, A', 'Fan, H', 'McPherson, A']","['Kuznetsov YG', 'Low A', 'Fan H', 'McPherson A']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force/*methods', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity/*ultrastructure', '*Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells/virology', 'Virion/metabolism/*ultrastructure']",,2004/06/15 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/06/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.023 [doi]', 'S0042682204001515 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2004 Jun 1;323(2):189-96. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.023.,,,,,"['CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM58868/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate genetic changes that tend to be detected with FISH only, we compared the results of cytogenetic study and FISH analysis in 919 consecutive specimens from 304 patients with hematologic malignancies, covering most of the frequent genetic changes by using 18 types of FISH probes. The genetic changes with especially large discrepancy rates at diagnosis were del(7q) (20.0%), PML/RARA (17.6%), and trisomy 21 (12.5%) and, at follow-up, BCR/ABL (28.2%) and AML1/ETO (24.4%); the latter two showed only small discrepancies at diagnosis (4.7 and 4.8%, respectively). The overall discrepancy rate was 6.0% at diagnosis and 11.9% at follow-up, indicating generally greater discrepancy rates at follow-up. In all but one of the cases with discrepant results, G-banding missed the corresponding chromosomal abnormalities revealed with FISH. Considered by type of leukemia, the discrepancy rate at follow-up was higher in acute biphenoptypic leukemia (38%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24.5%) than in acute myelogenous leukemia (10.6%). Given these results, all patients with known genetic changes should have FISH analysis in follow-up, for an accurate assessment of the likelihood of complete remission or recurrence.

Study design Children with ALL (N=24) were treated with prednisolone (40 mg/m(2) per day) for 28 days during the induction phase followed by 1 week of oral dexamethasone every 4 weeks. A low-dose (1 microg) adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) test was performed 2 weeks after discontinuation of prednisolone; it was repeated 2 weeks later and then every 4 weeks in patients with adrenal suppression until normal response was achieved. RESULTS: Adrenal suppression was found in 46% of patients at 2 weeks after discontinuation of prednisolone; it persisted in 38%, 29%, and 13% of patients through 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 20 weeks, respectively. Adrenal suppression appeared to last significantly longer in children aged >or=5 years than in children aged <5 years. Four children developed febrile neutropenia; all belonged to the adrenal suppressed group and were unable to mount an adequate adrenal response to the stress. CONCLUSIONS: About 50% of children with ALL developed adrenal suppression 2 weeks after a 4-week induction therapy with prednisolone.

The gene encodes a number of alternative RNA splice variants with differing abilities to either enhance or suppress apoptosis, and it is likely that this ability to modulate apoptosis is central to the putative tumour suppressor activity of LUCA-15. This report demonstrates for the first time that expression from the LUCA-15 locus modulates apoptosis triggered by the death-inducing ligand TRAIL. Using Jurkat T lymphoblastic leukemia cells, LUCA-15 expression was shown to enhance not only TRAIL but TNF-alpha- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. LUCA-15, therefore, has the ability to lower the apoptotic threshold of multiple receptor-initiated death-inducing signals. Of note, sensitisation of the Jurkat cells to TRAIL was shown to depend on new protein synthesis, since no enhancement of apoptosis was observed when cells were exposed to both TRAIL and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. This result suggests that LUCA-15 does not act independently to regulate apoptosis, but modulates a process that requires additional, newly synthesized protein. These results may explain the putative role of LUCA-15 as a tumour suppressor, suggesting that lack of functional LUCA-15 could provide the means by which malignant T cells escape receptor-initiated apoptotic signals.","['Rintala-Maki, N D', 'Sutherland, L C']","['Rintala-Maki ND', 'Sutherland LC']","['Tumour Biology Group, Northeastern Ontario Regional Cancer Centre, Sudbury, P3E 5J1 ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RBM5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",,2004/06/12 05:00,2005/03/19 09:00,['2004/06/12 05:00'],"['2004/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/B:APPT.0000031455.79352.57 [doi]', '5273716 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2004 Jul;9(4):475-84. doi: 10.1023/B:APPT.0000031455.79352.57.,,['Copyright 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the key events of apoptosis at the mitochondrial level, we developed a flow cytometric method for simultaneous detection of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 processing using conformation sensitive monoclonal antibodies. This method proved to identify deficient mitochondrial apoptosis signaling in leukemia cells overexpressing Bcl-2 by a pattern of apoptosis resistance, deficient cytochrome c reduction and partial processing of caspase-3. In primary leukemia cells, reduction of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation was induced by treatment with anticancer drugs in vitro.

It is generally believed that chemotherapeutic drugs induce mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9, leading to apoptosis. Here, we found that an isoprenoid antibiotic, 4-O-methyl ascochlorin, significantly induces typical apoptotic events in Jurkat cells including the degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, -9 and -8, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Similar to Fas stimulation, 4-O-methyl ascochlorin but not staurosporine, cycloheximide and actinomycin D, induced apoptosis in SKW6.4 cells, in which apoptosis is strongly dependent on death-inducing signaling-complex. Bcl-2 overexpression in Jurkat cells completely suppressed the apoptosis, but procaspase-9 processing was partially induced. A caspase-8 inhibitor, IETD-fmk, effectively suppressed poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and cytochrome c release. However, 4-O-methyl ascochlorin induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells deficient of caspase-8 or Fas-associated death domain protein. These results suggest that 4-O-methyl ascochlorin induces apoptosis through the mechanism distinct from conventional apoptosis inducers.","['Tsuruga, M', 'Nakajima, H', 'Ozawa, S', 'Togashi, M', 'Chang, Y-C', 'Ando, K', 'Magae, J']","['Tsuruga M', 'Nakajima H', 'Ozawa S', 'Togashi M', 'Chang YC', 'Ando K', 'Magae J']","['Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Research and Innovation, 1201 Takada, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-0861, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '38561-40-9 (4-O-methylascochlorin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",,2004/06/12 05:00,2005/03/19 09:00,['2004/06/12 05:00'],"['2004/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/B:APPT.0000031456.09297.8f [doi]', '5273717 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2004 Jul;9(4):429-35. doi: 10.1023/B:APPT.0000031456.09297.8f.,,['Copyright 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) are of particular concern since in vitro experiments have demonstrated that human cells are susceptible to such microorganisms. To monitor the transmission of PERV, highly sensitive and specific immunoassays must be developed for clinical surveillance. This report describes the production, preliminary characterization and application of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a recombinant PERV envelope (Env) protein. The generated mAb was tested using recombinant PERV Env protein expressed in Escherichia coli, purified PERV virus particles and human 293 cell line infected with PERV. PERV-translated proteins of 15, 70 and 85 kD were recognized specifically using PERV-8E10 mAb and Western blotting. No cross-reactivity was demonstrated with exogenous viral protein (HIV, HTLV and MuLV). Moreover, PERV-8E10 mAb can be applied to localize PERV proteins using an immunoperoxidase assay. This work reveals that recombinant PERV Env protein and mAb may be effective in detecting antibodies against PERV in xenotransplanted patients, or for butchers who have extensive contact with pigs.","['Wang, Shih-Rong', 'Chang, Jen-Ting', 'Lin, Meng-Shiue', 'Chiang, Chen-Yi', 'Chang, Hwan-You']","['Wang SR', 'Chang JT', 'Lin MS', 'Chiang CY', 'Chang HY']","['Division of Biotechnology, Animal Technology Institute Taiwan, Taiwan, ROC. wsr@mail.atit.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Intervirology,Intervirology,0364265,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/growth & development/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Swine', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/adverse effects', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",,2004/06/12 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/06/12 05:00'],"['2003/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000077832 [doi]', '77832 [pii]']",ppublish,Intervirology. 2004;47(2):93-101. doi: 10.1159/000077832.,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

We evaluated outcomes in 57 children (11 with Down syndrome) and 69 adults with M7 AML after first complete remission (CR1) following autologous or HLA-identical allogeneic transplantation. Characteristics of the recipients of autologous transplants (38 children, 37 adults) were, respectively: median age, 1.7 and 46 years; non-total body irradiation (non-TBI) conditioning regimen, 97% and 70%; bone marrow as stem cell source, 74% and 43%.

Autologous transplantation benefited children more; the relapse rate was high in adults. Results for autologous transplantation were (children and adults, respectively): engraftment, 90% and 100%; 3-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate, 3% and 8%; relapse rate, 45% and 64%; leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate, 52% and 27%; overall survival (OS) rate, 61% and 30%.

Prior studies assessing the effects of mismatches at specific HLA loci have yielded conflicting results. The importance of high-resolution matching for all HLA loci has also not been established. We therefore examined the effects of HLA matching (low or high resolution or both) on engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and mortality in 1874 donor-recipient pairs retrospectively typed at high resolution for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQ, and -DP. Mismatches at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 each had similar adverse effects on mortality. Only HLA-A mismatches demonstrated significant adverse effects on GVHD. These adverse effects on outcome were more evident in transplants with low-resolution versus only high-resolution mismatches. Mismatches for HLA-DQ or -DP did not significantly affect outcome. When high-resolution mismatches at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 were considered together, adverse effects on survival and GVHD were observed. We therefore conclude that matching for HLA-C should be incorporated into algorithms for unrelated donor selection. High-resolution mismatches at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 adversely affect outcome, but less so than low-resolution mismatches. When clinical circumstances allow, high-resolution class I typing may help optimize donor selection and improve outcome.","['Flomenberg, Neal', 'Baxter-Lowe, Lee Ann', 'Confer, Dennis', 'Fernandez-Vina, Marcelo', 'Filipovich, Alexandra', 'Horowitz, Mary', 'Hurley, Carolyn', 'Kollman, Craig', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Noreen, Harriet', 'Begovich, Ann', 'Hildebrand, William', 'Petersdorf, Effie', 'Schmeckpeper, Barbara', 'Setterholm, Michelle', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth', 'Williams, Thomas', 'Yunis, Edmond', 'Weisdorf, Daniel']","['Flomenberg N', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Confer D', 'Fernandez-Vina M', 'Filipovich A', 'Horowitz M', 'Hurley C', 'Kollman C', 'Anasetti C', 'Noreen H', 'Begovich A', 'Hildebrand W', 'Petersdorf E', 'Schmeckpeper B', 'Setterholm M', 'Trachtenberg E', 'Williams T', 'Yunis E', 'Weisdorf D']","['Department of Medicine and Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA. neal.flomenberg@mail.tju.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*chemistry', 'HLA-A Antigens/chemistry', 'HLA-B Antigens/chemistry', 'HLA-C Antigens/*chemistry/immunology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/chemistry', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/chemistry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/chemistry', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/06/12 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/06/12 05:00'],"['2004/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-03-0803 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43344-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 1;104(7):1923-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0803.

We investigated in the DA1-3b mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia how leukemic cells could persist for months in spite of an effective antileukemic immune response. Mice were immunized with irradiated interleukin 12 (IL12)- or CD154-transduced DA1-3b cells, challenged with wild-type DA1-3b cells, and randomly killed during 1-year follow-up. Quantification of residual disease 1 year after challenge showed that persistent leukemic cells represented less than 0.02% of spleen cells in most animals. These residual cells were still able to kill naive hosts, even when isolated after 1 year of persistence. Persistent leukemic cells were more resistant to specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)-mediated killing and had enhanced B7-H1 and B7.1 expression proportional to the time they had persisted in the host. Blocking B7-H1 or B7.1/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) interaction enhanced CTL-mediated killing of the persistent cells, and blocking B7-H1, B7.1, or CTLA-4 in vivo prolonged survival of naive mice injected with persistent leukemic cells. Thus, escape of leukemic cells from tumor immunity via overexpression of B7-H1 or B7.1 might represent a new mechanism of tumor dormancy in acute leukemia.","['Saudemont, Aurore', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Saudemont A', 'Quesnel B']","['Unite INSERM 524, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/chemistry', 'B7-1 Antigen/chemistry/*immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'Blood Proteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Peptides/chemistry/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",,2004/06/12 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/06/12 05:00'],"['2004/06/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0064 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43372-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 1;104(7):2124-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0064.

This skin disorder is frequently observed in patients with leukaemia or connective tissue diseases, while it is very rare in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The present report deals with the case of a febrile diffuse skin eruption in a 53-year-old patient with moderately active ulcerative colitis after few days' treatment with steroids and azathioprine. At first, the dermatosis was addressed to an idiosyncrasy to azathioprine, which was, therefore, promptly discontinued.

METHODS: A case of RP associated with HCV infection is reported. The English language medical and scientific literature was reviewed for RP, hepatitis C, and its relation to other connective tissue diseases from February 1966 to January 2003 using MEDLINE. RESULTS: RP is an uncommon, multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilaginous and related tissues, being associated with other diseases in 30% to 35% of cases. HCV infection is a systemic illness with a propensity to trigger or exacerbate autoimmune disorders: eg, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and leukocytoclastic and systemic vasculitis. We could find no previous report of an association between RP with HCV and mixed cryoglobulinemia. Treatment with interferon gamma and ribavirin (IR) not only induced an undetectable viral load, but also resolved symptoms of RP. CONCLUSIONS: We report a patient with RP, HCV, and mixed cryoglobulinemia. It is unknown if there is a cause-effect or chance relationship. Treatment with IR improved the symptoms of RP. It is not known whether the effects of IR were directly on the RP or suppressed RP indirectly through the actions on the viral load or active hepatitis.","['Herrera, Ivonne', 'Concha, Ronald', 'Molina, Enrique G', 'Schiff, Eugene R', 'Altman, Roy D']","['Herrera I', 'Concha R', 'Molina EG', 'Schiff ER', 'Altman RD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cryoglobulinemia/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Polychondritis, Relapsing/complications/*diagnosis/*immunology/therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Ribavirin/therapeutic use']",141,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0049017203002130 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semarthrit.2003.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 2004 Jun;33(6):388-403. doi: 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2003.11.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CML, transformation to acute leukemia is a common occurrence, with the timeline measured in years rather than decades. With the other three disorders from this group, polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), transformation to acute leukemia is less frequently seen and, although variable, can take a longer period of time.

However, establishing the diagnosis of an MPD other than CML is problematic due to a lack of clinically applicable clonal markers. Furthermore, in some patients, in whom a classical MPD phenotype is present, the hematopoietic stem cells appear to be polyclonal, suggesting that the chronic MPD other than CML may actually be a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Furthermore, since the aberrant clone is believed to arise from a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell, the non-CML chronic MPD-ET, PV, and IMF-could be related. Additional unresolved issues regarding the MPD include: identification of the multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell involved, the molecular basis for the clinical heterogeneity amongst the individual MPD, the clinical significance of clonality in non-CML MPD, and reconciliation of therapy with the clonal and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders. Determination of clonality has largely been carried out using X chromosome-linked polymorphisms, but such studies are limited to women and with increasing patient age are compromised by skewing of allelic expression in both neutrophils and T lymphocytes, making the results difficult to interpret. X chromosome-linked polymorphism studies have indicated that in PV the target stem cell is one that gives rise to both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors. Recently, two epigenetic markers have been identified in the MPD: impaired expression of the thrombopoietin receptor, Mpl, in platelets and megakaryocytes, and overexpression in neutrophils of the mRNA of a gene designated polycythemia rubra vera-1 (PRV-1). The role of these epigenetic abnormalities in the diagnosis of the MPD remains to be established. Currently, given the unresolved issues with respect to the clinical and clonal heterogeneity of the MPD, treatment needs to be tailored individually in patients with an MPD.","['Spivak, Jerry L']",['Spivak JL'],"['Hematology Division, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD177 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",49,2004/06/11 05:00,2005/01/29 09:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0037196304000393 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.02.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2004 Apr;41(2 Suppl 3):1-5. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.02.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents that interact with newly defined biologic targets and that are under investigation include arsenic trioxide, DNA methylation inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, thalidomide, immunomodulating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors.","['Fenaux, Pierre']",['Fenaux P'],"[""Service d'Hematoilogie, Clinicique/ Paris XIII University, Avicenne Hospital, France. pierre.fenaux@avc-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",39,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0037196304000204 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.02.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2004 Apr;41(2 Suppl 4):6-12. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.02.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose that specific niches within the tumor microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of tumor cells to evade or circumvent drug-induced death and that this may represent a form of de novo drug resistance. We have found that elements of the bone marrow microenvironment, including extracellular matrices and normal stromal elements, protect malignant cells, including leukemia and myeloma cells, from drug-induced cell death. This extrinsic form of drug resistance may allow cells to survive initial drug treatment and thereby acquire a more complex, intrinsic drug-resistant phenotype. Focusing on this form of de novo drug resistance may ultimately prevent the emergence of acquired drug resistance and enhance drug therapy for hematologic malignancies.","['Dalton, William S', 'Hazlehurst, Lori', 'Shain, Kenneth', 'Landowski, Terry', 'Alsina, Melissa']","['Dalton WS', 'Hazlehurst L', 'Shain K', 'Landowski T', 'Alsina M']","['H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans']",21,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0037196304000198 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2004 Apr;41(2 Suppl 4):1-5. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2004.02.001.,,,,,"['CA 82533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were subclassified into two groups. Group I formed 13 patients with B-CLL at the time of diagnosis and group II 10 patients with B-CLL after the therapy but not in remission. For definition of B-CLL cells we used immunological marker analysis of surface markers characteristic for B-CLL pattern: CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23 and HLA DR and enumeration of fluorescence intensity of these markers given by molecular equivalent of soluble fluorochrome--MESF. In group II of B-CLL patients, who were already treated, in PB and BM somehow lower MESF values for CD19, CD20 and CD23 markers and higher MESF values for CD5 marker (in PB and BM) than in group I patients have been detected. The MESF level of HLA DR marker was little higher in group II than in group I B-CLL patients. However in PB and BM the percentage expression of HLA DR and CD19 markers in both patients groups was approximately the same. The values of HLA DR, CD19, CD20, CD23 and CD5 markers (% expression and MESF values) in both patients groups with B-CLL were significantly higher versus controls (p<0.001 resp. p<0.01) even in PB and BM. In conclusion, in our study we observed that the patients with B-CLL after therapy (group II) had similar or a little smaller (except CD5) but nonsignificantly decreased expression level of markers characteristic for B-CLL, but the MESF values of some of them (CD19, CD23) were significantly (p<0.05) decreased when compared with untreated B-CLL patients (group I). The determination of antigen density (MESF values) may be an important marker to characterize the leukemic cells. Our results showed that chemotherapy did not influence in a significant level the antigen modulation of B-CLL cells, however, could influence MESF values of some characteristic markers. Quantitative analysis of some markers in B-CLL cells seems to offer valuable information concerning possible influence of some chemotherapeutics on antigen equipment of leukemic cells.","['Kusenda, J', 'Babusikova, O']","['Kusenda J', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonkuda@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis']",,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2004;51(2):97-102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the expression and activity of COX-1 and -2 during granulocyte-oriented maturation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) of NB4 cells, originated from a human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and in blasts from APL patients. The expression of COX isoenzymes or prostaglandin synthases was also investigated in circulating granulocytes and human bone marrow. COX-1 was expressed and enzymatically active in NB4 cells and primary blasts. COX-1 mRNA and protein were induced by ATRA. COX-1 protein increased approximately 2-3.5-fold by culture day 3 in NB4 cells and primary blasts, while basal COX-2 expression was very low and unaffected by ATRA. COX-1-dependent PGE(2) biosynthesis increased during differentiation approx. 5-fold. Indomethacin and the selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560, but not selective COX-2 inhibition, impaired NB4 differentiation, reducing NADPH-oxidase activity, CD11b and CD11c expression. The immunohistochemistry of granulocytes and myeloid precursors in the bone marrow showed a large prevalence of COX-1 as compared to COX-2.

Since ABL-dependent intracellular signaling molecules are involved in T-cell activation, imatinib may affect T-cell responses in vivo, thus affecting T-cell function in CML patients, disrupting immune reconstitution after allogeneic SCT and/or impeding the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Here we demonstrate that imatinib inhibits PHA-induced proliferation of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells at in vitro concentrations (1-5 micromol/l) representative of the pharmacological doses used therapeutically in vivo. The effect is not dependent on antigen-presenting cells because CD3/CD28-induced T-cell stimulation was similarly inhibited by imatinib. Dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferative response of purified CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes to anti-CD3/CD28 was similarly observed and associated with reduction in IFN-gamma production. The inhibitory effect could not be ascribed to an increased rate of apoptosis but the expression of activation markers on CD3+ T cells was significantly reduced in the presence of imatinib (1-5 micromol/L). Inhibition of T-cell proliferation was reversible after removal of the drug from the cultures. Thus, imatinib inhibits T-cell proliferation in vitro, an effect that is APC-independent, reversible, and does not involve apoptosis induction.","['Cwynarski, K', 'Laylor, R', 'Macchiarulo, E', 'Goldman, J', 'Lombardi, G', 'Melo, J V', 'Dazzi, F']","['Cwynarski K', 'Laylor R', 'Macchiarulo E', 'Goldman J', 'Lombardi G', 'Melo JV', 'Dazzi F']","['Department of Immunology, Division of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College at Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Blood Cells', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403401 [doi]', '2403401 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1332-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403401.,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2005 Mar;19(3):456-7; author reply 457.

Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was reported in HTLV-I associated cells, and has been implicated in oncogenesis and resistance to anticancer agents and apoptosis. We studied the effect of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (formerly known as PS-341), on ATL cells in vitro and in vivo. Bortezomib could inhibit the degradation of IkappaBalpha in ATL cells, resulting in suppression of NF-kappaB and induction of cell death in ATL cells in vitro. Susceptibilities to bortezomib were well correlated with NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that suppression of the NF-kappaB pathway was implicated in the cell death induced by bortezomib. Although the majority of the cell death was apoptosis, necrotic cell death was observed in the presence of a caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. When bortezomib was administered into SCID mice bearing tumors, it suppressed tumor growth in vivo, showing that bortezomib was effective against ATL cells in vivo. These studies revealed that bortezomib is highly effective against ATL cells in vitro and in vivo by induction of apoptosis, and its clinical application might improve the prognosis of patients with this fatal disease.","['Satou, Y', 'Nosaka, K', 'Koya, Y', 'Yasunaga, J-I', 'Toyokuni, S', 'Matsuoka, M']","['Satou Y', 'Nosaka K', 'Koya Y', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Toyokuni S', 'Matsuoka M']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/drug effects', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403400 [doi]', '2403400 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1357-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cases of emergence of clonal chromosomal abnormalities after therapy with imatinib have been reported, but their incidence, etiology and prognosis remain to be clarified. We report here a large series of 34 CML patients treated with imatinib who developed Philadelphia (Ph)-negative clones. Among 1001 patients with Ph-positive CML treated with imatinib, 34 (3.4%) developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells. Three patients were treated with imatinib up-front. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities were trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 in twelve and seven patients, respectively. In 15 patients, fluorescent in situ hybridization with specific probes was performed in materials archived before the initiation of imatinib. The Ph-negative clone was related to previous therapy in three patients, and represented a minor pre-existing clone that expanded after the eradication of Ph-positive cells with imatinib in two others. However, in 11 patients, the new clonal chromosomal abnormalities were not detected and imatinib may have had a direct effect. No myelodysplasia was found in our cohort.

Exploiting the selective affinity of Achatinin-H toward N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid-alpha2-6-GalNAc, we have demonstrated the presence of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins (Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs) on lymphoblasts of 70 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and on leukemic cell lines by fluorimetric HPLC and flow cytometric analysis. This study aims to assess the structural aspect of the glycotope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) and to evaluate whether these disease-specific molecules can be used to monitor the clinical outcome of ALL. The Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) were affinity-purified, and three distinct leukemia-specific molecular determinants (135, 120, and 90 kDa) were demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and isoelectric focusing. The carbohydrate epitope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) was confirmed by using synthetic sialic acid analogs. The enhanced presence of anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GP(ALL) antibody in ALL patients prompted us to develop an antigen-ELISA using purified Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) as coating antigens. Purified antigen was able to detect leukemia-specific antibodies at presentation of disease, which gradually decreased with treatment. Longitudinal monitoring of 18 patients revealed that in the early phase of the treatment patients with lower anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs showed a better prognosis. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed in other hematological disorders (n = 50) like chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as normal healthy individuals (n = 21). This study demonstrated the potential of purified Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) as an alternate tool for detection of anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GP antibodies to be helpful for diagnosis and monitoring of childhood ALL patients.","['Pal, Santanu', 'Ghosh, Shyamasree', 'Mandal, Chhabinath', 'Kohla, Guido', 'Brossmer, Reinhard', 'Isecke, Rainer', 'Merling, Anette', 'Schauer, Roland', 'Schwartz-Albiez, Reinhard', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip K', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Pal S', 'Ghosh S', 'Mandal C', 'Kohla G', 'Brossmer R', 'Isecke R', 'Merling A', 'Schauer R', 'Schwartz-Albiez R', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.

While avermectins did not affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to hydrogen peroxide and cisplatin, they significantly enhanced the sensitivity of cells of both wild-type and resistant strains to taxol and vincristine. The coefficients of modification for resistant strains were substantially higher. Avermectins suppressed the efflux of rhodamine 123 from cells and increased the accumulation of calcein in cells. The relative inhibitory activity of avermectins depended on the cell type and on the substrate of multidrug resistance proteins whose transport they suppressed (vincristine, taxol, rhodamine 123, calcein acetoxymethyl ester).

PATIENTS: The present report covers only patients diagnosed when aged > or =65 years. SETTING: A well-defined area of Sweden, the so-called Western Swedish Health Care Region and Estonia. Population-wise, the western Swedish Region and Estonia are very similar; area-wise they are also well comparable. RESULTS: The number of acute de novo leukaemias was quite dissimilar in the two countries (Estonia, n = 137, Sweden, n = 354). The age standardized incidence rates regarding the total number of acute de novo leukaemias was 5.31 per 100,000 inhabitants/year for Estonia and 7.99 for Sweden, this difference being statistically significant. However, the difference was merely attributable to incidence rates as regards acute myeloblastic leukaemias (AML); on the contrary, differences as regards acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) and non-classifiable, undifferentiated or biphenotypic acute leukaemias (uAL) were negligible. The relative survival for the total material of patients was significantly higher for Swedish when compared with Estonian patients (P < 0.001). Thus, the relative survival for the total material of patients aged > or =65 years in Estonia at 1 year was 8.5% and at 3 years 3.5% respectively. The corresponding figures for the Swedish patients were considerably higher, 22.7 and 7.7% respectively. This difference, however, applied only for patients with AML (P < 0.001), whereas the results for patients with ALL and uAL were equally dismal. CONCLUSION: The results clearly reflect how political and socio-economic factors may influence the survival of acute leukemia patients in two neighbouring countries.","['Luik, E', 'Palk, K', 'Everaus, H', 'Varik, M', 'Aareleid, T', 'Wennstrom, L', 'Juntikka, E-L', 'Safai-Kutti, S', 'Stockelberg, D', 'Holmberg, E', 'Kutti, J']","['Luik E', 'Palk K', 'Everaus H', 'Varik M', 'Aareleid T', 'Wennstrom L', 'Juntikka EL', 'Safai-Kutti S', 'Stockelberg D', 'Holmberg E', 'Kutti J']","['Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Tartu University Clinics, Tartu, Estonia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,,IM,"['Aged', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Environment', 'Estonia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,2004/06/11 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/06/11 05:00'],"['2004/06/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2796.2004.01335.x [doi]', 'JIM1335 [pii]']",ppublish,J Intern Med. 2004 Jul;256(1):79-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2004.01335.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CBF is a critical regulator in the generation and differentiation of definitive hematopoietic stem cells and is frequently disrupted in leukemia through chromosome translocations. We cloned a novel AML1 partner gene, PRDX4, in an X;21 translocation in a 74-year-old male patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia-M2. Chromosome analysis detected a t(X;21)(p22;q22) as the sole abnormality in bone marrow samples. The involvement of AML1 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization studies. Using 3' RACE-PCR, we cloned a fusion between exon 5 of AML1 and exon 2 of PRDX4. RT-PCR confirmed the fusion and detected another fusion between exon 6 of AML1 and exon 2 of PRDX4, indicating alternative splicing of exon 6 of AML1 in the fusion transcripts. PRDX4 is one of six peroxiredoxin-family genes that are highly conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are ubiquitously expressed. Peroxiredoxin genes exhibit thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity and have been implicated in a number of other cellular functions such as cell proliferation and differentiation. PRDX4 plays a regulatory role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and is significantly down-regulated in acute promyelocytic leukemia. This is the first example of antioxidant enzyme involvement in a chromosome translocation in leukemia.","['Zhang, Yanming', 'Emmanuel, Neelmini', 'Kamboj, Ginny', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Shurafa, Muhammad', 'Van Dyke, Daniel L', 'Wiktor, Anne', 'Rowley, Janet D']","['Zhang Y', 'Emmanuel N', 'Kamboj G', 'Chen J', 'Shurafa M', 'Van Dyke DL', 'Wiktor A', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX4 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Peroxidases', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Reading Frames/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20050 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Aug;40(4):365-70. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20050.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA84405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerical centrosome abnormalities or mutations in genes associated with the mitotic spindle checkpoint (BUB1 and MAD2) are two important mechanisms that can induce abnormal mitosis resulting in aneuploid daughter cells. To assess the role of these mechanisms, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques to determine aneuploidy and centrosome copy number and PCR-SSCP to identify gene mutations of BUB1 and MAD2 in marrow cells of 25 patients. No mutations were found in BUB1 or MAD2 genes. However, we found that cells with more than two centrosomes exhibited aneuploidy for three or more chromosomes. We conclude that centrosome amplification may be associated with the development of a clonal population of potentially preleukemic aneuploid cells.","['Kearns, William G', 'Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Young, Neal S', 'Liu, Johnson M']","['Kearns WG', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Young NS', 'Liu JM']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Centrosome/*chemistry/*metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20043 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Aug;40(4):329-33. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20043.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: U937 monocytic leukemia cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were rendered necrotic by freeze-thawing or apoptotic by treatment with ultraviolet light. Cell culture supernatants from these cells and IgG from SLE patients (SLE IgG) were added to cultures of normal PBMCs or purified plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs). The importance of nucleic acids for IFN alpha induction was investigated by RNase and DNase treatment. The IFN alpha levels were measured by immunoassay. RESULTS: Both necrotic and apoptotic U937 cells released material that, combined with SLE IgG, induced IFN alpha production in PDCs. The release from apoptotic cells occurred with a 16-hour delay, in late apoptosis. Also, normal PBMCs released IFN alpha-inducing material, but only during necrosis. The interferogenic activity of the necrotic material required the presence of RNA, while both RNA and DNA were important in the apoptotic material. In both cases, the presence of SLE IgG was necessary, and its activity correlated with the presence of antibodies to RNA-binding proteins, but not anti-DNA antibodies. CONCLUSION: Necrotic and late apoptotic cells release material that, combined with SLE IgG, induces production of IFN alpha in PDCs. The IFN alpha inducers probably consist of immune complexes (ICs) containing RNA and possibly DNA as essential interferogenic components. The presence of such interferogenic ICs could explain the ongoing production of IFN alpha in SLE and could be of etiopathogenic importance.","['Lovgren, Tanja', 'Eloranta, Maija-Leena', 'Bave, Ullvi', 'Alm, Gunnar V', 'Ronnblom, Lars']","['Lovgren T', 'Eloranta ML', 'Bave U', 'Alm GV', 'Ronnblom L']","['Immunology V, Biomedical Center, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. tanja.lovgren@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Complex/*genetics/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/pharmacology', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Necrosis', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.20254 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2004 Jun;50(6):1861-72. doi: 10.1002/art.20254.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to analyze the relation of aberrant DNA methylation to clinical and biological risk factors, we have determined the cytosine methylation level of 81 patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The analysis was based on DNA hydrolysis followed by derivatization of the 2'-desoxyribonucleoside-3'-monophosphates with BODIPY FL EDA. Derivatives were separated by micellar electrokinetic chromatography, and laser-induced fluorescence was used for detection. We analyzed potential correlations between DNA methylation levels and numerous patient parameters, including clinical observations and biological data. As a result, we observed a significant correlation with the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (VH) mutation status. This factor has been repeatedly proposed as a reliable prognostic marker for CLL, which suggests that the methylation level might be a valuable factor in determining the prognostic outcome of CLL. We are now in the process of refining our method to broaden its application potential. In this context, we show here that the oxidation of the fluorescence marker in the samples and the evaporation of methanol in the electrolytes can be prevented by a film of paraffin oil. In summary, our results thus establish capillary electrophoresis as a valuable tool for analyzing the DNA methylation status of clinical samples.","['Lyko, Frank', 'Stach, Dirk', 'Brenner, Axel', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Wirtz, Michaela', 'Wiessler, Manfred', 'Schmitz, Oliver J']","['Lyko F', 'Stach D', 'Brenner A', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner H', 'Wirtz M', 'Wiessler M', 'Schmitz OJ']","['Research Group Epigenetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,"['0 (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)', '0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Boron Compounds/chemistry', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytosine/*chemistry', '*DNA Methylation', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/elps.200305830 [doi]'],ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2004 Jun;25(10-11):1530-5. doi: 10.1002/elps.200305830.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated whether 8-Cl-cAMP is useful for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), which is hallmarked by the expression of the p210(bcr/abl) oncogene. Autologous bone marrow transplantation is a feasible alternative for patients with no suitable donor, but hampered by the risk of relapse due to the persistence of leukaemia cells in the transplant. To study the effects of 8-Cl-cAMP on primary leukaemic cells, bone marrow cells (BMCs) from eight CML patients (one at diagnosis, three in chronic and four in accelerated phase) were treated. Ex vivo treatment of BMCs obtained in chronic phase of CML with 100 microM 8-Cl-cAMP for 24-48 h led to the selective purging of Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph1 chromosome) without toxic side effects on BMCs from healthy donors as measured by colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. BMCs from patients in accelerated phase showed selective, but incomplete elimination of Ph1 chromosome positive colony forming cells. The mechanism of 8-Cl-cAMP was investigated in FDCP-mix cells transformed by p210(bcr/abl), a cell culture model for CML. The results showed that 8-Cl-cAMP reduced DNA synthesis and viability independent of Raf inhibition as Raf inhibitors had no effect. MEK inhibitors interfered with DNA synthesis, but not with viability. In summary, our results indicate that 8-Cl-cAMP could be useful to purge malignant cells from the bone marrow of patients with CML and certain other forms of leukaemias.","['Weissinger, E M', 'Oettrich, K', 'Evans, C', 'Genieser, H-G', 'Schwede, F', 'Dangers, M', 'Dammann, E', 'Kolb, H-J', 'Mischak, H', 'Ganser, A', 'Kolch, W']","['Weissinger EM', 'Oettrich K', 'Evans C', 'Genieser HG', 'Schwede F', 'Dangers M', 'Dammann E', 'Kolb HJ', 'Mischak H', 'Ganser A', 'Kolch W']","['Medizinische Hochschule Hannover (MHH), Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6601909 [doi]', '6601909 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2004 Jul 5;91(1):186-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601909.,,,,,,,,,PMC2364761,,,,,,,,,

These new data will be reviewed in the context of previous trials and new observations of novel approaches involving HAC. RECENT FINDINGS: The large Medical Research Council (MRC)/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the smaller Cancer and Leukaemia Group B (CALGB) trials reported conflicting conclusions. Lack of difference in response rates and survival outcomes was noted by the European trial groups whereas the contrary was reported by the US investigators, with statistically significant difference in response rates of 48% and 25% and median survival of 22.7 months and 19.8 months, respectively, being observed, favoring HAC. Early studies testing incorporation of irinotecan or oxaliplatin into HAC, either as additional systemic chemotherapy or as integral components of the HAC infusional regimen, confirmed feasibility, safety, and efficacy, with response rates between 30% and 60% being reported in some series. Other studies showed that combination with internal irradiation with lipiodol I-131 and biologic agents, eg, replication-selective adenovirus and cytokines, could be achieved with tolerable toxicity. Molecular prognostic factors that may help tailor treatment for individual patients were being investigated and low expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) and p21 was shown to correlate with better outcome, whereas patients with positive TS seemed to derive more benefit from HAC plus systemic chemotherapy than systemic chemotherapy alone. SUMMARY: These studies confirmed that fluoropyrimidine-based HAC cannot be recommended routinely outside clinical trial as yet, but this treatment has its own merits and will continue to evolve with the availability of novel chemotherapeutic and biologic agents. Further studies into molecular prognostic factors will eventually define the role of HAC by selecting the right drug and the best route of administration for an individual patient.","['Chan, Ray', 'Kerr, David']","['Chan R', 'Kerr D']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Hepatic Artery/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",67,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/11/09 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['00001622-200407000-00013 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cco.0000126577.04727.e9 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2004 Jul;16(4):378-84. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000126577.04727.e9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both were treated with imatinib mesylate after failing to respond to or being unable to tolerate standard therapy. In one patient, treatment with imatinib mesylate 100 mg/day produced resolution of symptoms and peripheral blood cell counts within 6 days. The patient has successfully maintained normal blood cell counts and has been without symptoms for more than one year after starting imatinib mesylate. The other patient failed to respond to imatinib mesylate even at the maximum dose (up to 400 mg/day). DISCUSSION: Imatinib mesylate was considered an appropriate alternative for standard therapy of HES based on the evidence that other treatments used for chronic myelogenous leukemia have also been successful in treating HES. Three small studies have supported this hypothesis. However, not all patients with HES respond to imatinib mesylate therapy. The cases presented here illustrate the marked difference. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib mesylate has shown some promise in the treatment of HES. However, until the etiology of idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the role of imatinib mesylate in the resolution of this disease are determined, it will continue to be difficult to predict the responsiveness of a patient to imatinib mesylate therapy.","['Payne, Sonja M', 'Kovacs, Michael J']","['Payne SM', 'Kovacs MJ']","['University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/blood/*drug therapy', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1345/aph.1D505 [doi]', 'aph.1D505 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2004 Jul-Aug;38(7-8):1215-8. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D505.

We show that therapeutic concentrations of dexamethasone inhibit intermediate signaling events, in particular the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI)3-kinase and downstream signaling events that lead to degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells. This inhibitory action is mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor and is not apparent when cells are stimulated via Kit in a mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell line. The primary perturbation appears to be the failure of the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3-kinase to engage with the adaptor protein Grb2-associated binder 2 leading to suppression of phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma2, the calcium signal, and degranulation. Suppression of PI3-kinase activation by dexamethasone may also contribute to reduced cytokine production because the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, like dexamethasone, inhibits Ag-induced transcription of cytokine genes as well as degranulation.","['Andrade, Marcus V M', 'Hiragun, Takaaki', 'Beaven, Michael A']","['Andrade MV', 'Hiragun T', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Isoenzymes/physiology', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/pathology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Type C Phospholipases/physiology']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['172/12/7254 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.172.12.7254 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Jun 15;172(12):7254-62. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.172.12.7254.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein is regulated transcriptionally (eg, is a target for nuclear factor-kappaB [NF-kappaB]) and can be inhibited by mitochondrial proteins released in the cytoplasm upon apoptotic stimuli. The present study indicates that an additional level of regulation of c-IAP1 may be cell compartmentalization. The protein is present in the nucleus of undifferentiated U937 and THP1 monocytic cell lines. When these cells undergo differentiation under phorbol ester exposure, c-IAP1 translocates to the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi apparatus. This redistribution involves a nuclear export signal (NES)-mediated, leptomycin B-sensitive mechanism. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we localized the functional NES motif in the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of c-IAP1. A nucleocytoplasmic redistribution of the protein was also observed in human monocytes as well as in tumor cells from epithelial origin when undergoing differentiation. c-IAP1 does not translocate from the nucleus of cells whose differentiation is blocked (ie, in cell lines and monocytes from transgenic mice overexpressing B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2] and in monocytes from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Altogether, these observations associate c-IAP1 cellular location with cell differentiation, which opens new perspectives on the functions of the protein.","['Plenchette, Stephanie', 'Cathelin, Severine', 'Rebe, Cedric', 'Launay, Sophie', 'Ladoire, Sylvain', 'Sordet, Olivier', 'Ponnelle, Tibor', 'Debili, Najet', 'Phan, Thi-Hai', 'Padua, Rose-Ann', 'Dubrez-Daloz, Laurence', 'Solary, Eric']","['Plenchette S', 'Cathelin S', 'Rebe C', 'Launay S', 'Ladoire S', 'Sordet O', 'Ponnelle T', 'Debili N', 'Phan TH', 'Padua RA', 'Dubrez-Daloz L', 'Solary E']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U517, INSERM EPI 106, IFR100, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leucine/chemistry', 'Luminescent Proteins/chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0065 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43359-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 1;104(7):2035-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0065.

Functional involvement of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells in this process has been demonstrated. However, it remains controversial as to whether tumor endothelium itself is BM derived. Here we sought to address this issue with an endothelial-specific, inducible transgenic model. We generated Cretransgenic mice (endothelial-SCL-Cre-ER(T)) using the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T) recombinase driven by the 5' endothelial enhancer of the stem cell leukemia (SCL) locus. These mice were intercrossed with Cre reporter strains in which beta-galactosidase (LacZ) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) are expressed upon Cre-mediated recombination. After tamoxifen administration, endothelial LacZ staining was observed in embryonic and adult tissues. Cre-mediated recombination was also observed in newly generated tumor endothelium. In adult BM cells we could only detect trace amounts of recombination by flow cytometry. Subsequently, BM from endothelial-SCL-Cre-ER(T);R26R mice was transplanted into irradiated recipients. When tumors were grown in recipient mice, which received tamoxifen, no tumor LacZ staining was detected. However, when tumors were grown in endothelial-SCL-Cre-ER(T);R26R mice 3 weeks after the cessation of tamoxifen treatment, there was widespread endothelial LacZ staining present. Thus, this genetic model strongly suggests that BM cells do not contribute to tumor endothelium and demonstrates the lineage relation between pre-existing endothelium and newly generated tumor endothelial cells.","['Gothert, Joachim R', 'Gustin, Sonja E', 'van Eekelen, J Anke M', 'Schmidt, Uli', 'Hall, Mark A', 'Jane, Stephen M', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Izon, David J', 'Begley, C Glenn']","['Gothert JR', 'Gustin SE', 'van Eekelen JA', 'Schmidt U', 'Hall MA', 'Jane SM', 'Green AR', 'Gottgens B', 'Izon DJ', 'Begley CG']","['Division of Cancer Biology, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research and Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, University of Western Australia, West Perth, Australia. joachim.goethert@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)'],IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Endothelium/blood supply/embryology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-11-3952 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43423-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1769-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-11-3952.

To gain further insight to this process, we used transcript profiling in K562 cells expressing a dominant-negative Myb (MERT) protein. A total of 105 potential Myb gene targets were identified. Neuromedin U (NmU), a peptide affecting calcium transport, underwent the greatest expression change ( approximately 5-fold decrease). To verify a linkage between c-myb and NmU, their mRNA levels were quantitated using real-time polymerase chain reaction in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), as well as normal hematopoietic cells. We found that c-myb was elevated in AML and ALL samples, but NmU expression was increased only in AML cells. Significantly, only AML cells expressed the cognate receptor of NmU, NMU1R, suggesting the presence of a novel autocrine loop. We examined this possibility in detail. Exogenous NmU ""rescued"" growth suppression in K562-MERT cells and stimulated the growth of primary AML cells. Short interfering RNA ""knockdown"" of NmU in K562 cells arrested cell growth. Exposing Indo-1-labeled K562 cells to NmU induced an intracellular Ca(++) flux consistent with engagement of the NMU1R. Combined, these results suggest that NmU expression is related to Myb and that the NmU/NMU1R axis constitutes a previously unknown growth-promoting autocrine loop in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Shetzline, Susan E', 'Rallapalli, Ravikumar', 'Dowd, Kelley J', 'Zou, Shaomin', 'Nakata, Yuji', 'Swider, Cezary R', 'Kalota, Anna', 'Choi, John K', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Shetzline SE', 'Rallapalli R', 'Dowd KJ', 'Zou S', 'Nakata Y', 'Swider CR', 'Kalota A', 'Choi JK', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 18S)', '0 (Receptors, Neurotransmitter)', '0 (neuromedin U receptor)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '117505-80-3 (neuromedin U)', 'EC 1.2.1.12 (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating))', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Autocrine Communication', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myb/genetics', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating)/genetics', 'Growth Substances/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S/genetics', 'Receptors, Neurotransmitter/metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-10-3577 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43431-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1833-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-10-3577.

Among identified proteins, we focused on upstream stimulatory factor (USF1) and USF2 and investigated their effects on the PF4 promoter. USF1 and 2 bound to the E-box motif in the TME and strongly transactivated the PF4 promoter. Furthermore, physiologic bindings of USF1 and 2 to the TME in rat megakaryocytes were demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Interestingly, the E-box motif in the TME was conserved in TME-like sequences of both the human and mouse PF4 promoters. USF1 and 2 also bound to the human TME-like sequence and transactivated the human PF4 promoter.

Since the development of techniques to cultivate these cells from peripheral blood, there has been a great deal of interest in their use in immunotherapeutic strategies.

These DC, when pulsed with whole-tumor lysate, protein, or RNA from a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line, can induce anti-CML specific cytotoxicity in vitro by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). RNA and protein-pulsed DC were more effective than lysate-pulsed DC at inducing cytotoxicity at low effector:target (E:T) ratios.

CML cells were found to increase their level of MHC class I expression after exposure to CTL and pulsed DC thereby becoming better targets. These investigations lend support for the utilization of DC to generate anti-tumor responses in CML.","['Syme, Rachel', 'Bryan, Tracey', 'Duggan, Peter', 'Bajwa, Rubinder', 'Stewart, Doug', 'Gluck, Stefan']","['Syme R', 'Bryan T', 'Duggan P', 'Bajwa R', 'Stewart D', 'Gluck S']","['Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4N2.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/154732804323046828 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2004 Apr;13(2):211-21. doi: 10.1089/154732804323046828.,,"['Copyright Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, controversial results have been reported, and the role of the stroma in abnormal development of the hematopoietic system is not clear. In this study, CML hematopoietic and irradiated stromal cells were co-cultured in different combinations for 10 or 21 days. Maintenance of viable cells was dependent both on the sources of hematopoietic progenitors and stromal adherent layers, with normal cells performing better than their leukemic counterparts. The frequency of CD34(+) CD38(-) cells in the non-adherent fraction was more related to the source of hematopoietic cells than of stroma, and hematopoietic cells from normal subjects showed better performance. The simultaneous analysis of different combinations of normal and leukemic precursor cells and stromal layers, as done in the present work, suggests that the outcome of the interaction depends on characteristics of both compartments. This hematopoietic system development is influenced by intrinsic qualities of both hematopoietic stem cells and the supportive stroma.","['Cordero, Elvira Alicia Aparicio', 'Da Rocha Silla, Lucia Mariano', 'Canedo, Andres Delgado', 'Allebrandt, Waldir Francisco', 'Fogliatto, Laura', 'Nardi, Nance Beyer']","['Cordero EA', 'Da Rocha Silla LM', 'Canedo AD', 'Allebrandt WF', 'Fogliatto L', 'Nardi NB']","['Servico de Hematologia e Transplante de Medula Ossea, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*physiology']",,2004/06/10 05:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2004/06/10 05:00'],"['2004/06/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/154732804323099154 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2004 Jun;13(3):225-8. doi: 10.1089/154732804323099154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that p73 stability is directly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we show that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein modulates p73 half-life by inhibiting its degradation in a PML-nuclear body (NB)-dependent manner. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of p73 is required for p73 recruitment into the PML-NB and subsequent PML-dependent p73 stabilization. We find that p300-mediated acetylation of p73 protects it against ubiquitinylation and that PML regulates p73 stability by positively modulating its acetylation levels. As a result, PML potentiates p73 transcriptional and proapoptotic activities that are markedly impaired in Pml-/- primary cells. Our findings demonstrate that PML plays a crucial role in modulating p73 function, thus providing further insights on the molecular network for tumor suppression.","['Bernassola, Francesca', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Oberst, Andrew', 'Di Como, Charles J', 'Pagano, Michele', 'Melino, Gerry', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Bernassola F', 'Salomoni P', 'Oberst A', 'Di Como CJ', 'Pagano M', 'Melino G', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1084/jem.20031943 [doi]', 'jem.20031943 [pii]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2004 Jun 7;199(11):1545-57. doi: 10.1084/jem.20031943.,,,,,"['R01-GM57587/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM057587/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MC_U132670601/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01-CA76584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2211783,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We linked data from the Jerusalem Perinatal Study, a population-based research cohort (n = 88,829) of offspring born 1964 to 1976, with Israel's Cancer Registry. Risk factors for acute leukemia were assessed using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Leukemias developed in 65 individuals [24 acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and 41 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL)]. A positive linear relation was found between gender-adjusted birth weight and all leukemias [hazard ratio (HR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1-3.0] and AML (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.4). The association between birth weight and AML was especially notable among infants (HR 8.14, 95% CI 1.8-38.9 for age 0 to 1 year) but was also observed among subjects ages >14 years at diagnosis. The relation was particularly strong among females (P = 0.001). Other risk factors for AML risk on univariate analysis were maternal origin, socioeconomic status, birth weight of sibling > 3,500 g, and family size. On multivariate analysis, only birth weight retained borderline significance (adjusted HR 2.38 per kg, 95% CI 1.0-5.7).

This immunotoxin was produced extracellularly in toxin-sensitive Pichia pastoris JW102 (Mut(+)) under control of the AOX1 promoter. There were two major barriers to efficient immunotoxin production, the toxicity of the immunotoxin for P. pastoris and the limited capacity of P. pastoris to secrete the immunotoxin. The immunotoxin toxicity resulted in a decrease in the methanol consumption rate, cessation of cell growth, and low immunotoxin productivity after the first 22 h of methanol induction. Continuous cell growth and continuous immunotoxin secretion after the first 22 h of methanol induction were obtained by adding glycerol to the methanol feed by using a 4:1 methanol-glycerol mixed feed as an energy source and by continuously adding a yeast extract solution during methanol induction. The secretory capacity was increased from 22.5 to 37 mg/liter by lowering the induction temperature. A low temperature reduced the methanol consumption rate and protease activity in the supernatant but not cell growth. The effects of adding glycerol and yeast extract to the methanol feed were synergistic. Adding yeast extract primarily enhanced methanol utilization and cell growth, while adding glycerol primarily enhanced immunotoxin production. The synergy was further enhanced by decreasing the induction temperature from 23 to 15 degrees C, which resulted in a robust process with a yield of 37 mg/liter, which was sevenfold greater than the yield previously reported for a toxin-resistant CHO cell expression system. This methodology should be applicable to other toxin-related recombinant proteins in toxin-sensitive P. pastoris.","['Woo, Jung Hee', 'Liu, Yuan Yi', 'Stavrou, Scott', 'Neville, David M Jr']","['Woo JH', 'Liu YY', 'Stavrou S', 'Neville DM Jr']","['Biophysical Chemistry Section, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4034, USA. wooj@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Environ Microbiol,Applied and environmental microbiology,7605801,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['*Bioreactors', 'Biotechnology/methods', 'Culture Media', 'Fermentation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycerol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Pichia/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Temperature']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/AEM.70.6.3370-3376.2004 [doi]', '70/6/3370 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Environ Microbiol. 2004 Jun;70(6):3370-6. doi: 10.1128/AEM.70.6.3370-3376.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC427749,,,,,,,,,

Pit2 contains two copies of the protein homology domain PD001131, which defines the Pit family. These domains are presumably in opposite topology with respect to the plasma membrane plane. We have mutated a serine residue conserved in almost all of the 192 known PD001131 sequences to alanine in each PD001131 domain of human Pit2. Expression in CHO cells showed that phosphate uptake was affected severely in mutants, whereas susceptibility to virus infection was conserved. We reported previously that the inorganic phosphate concentration affects both phosphate transport mediated by Pit2 and the conformation of cell-surface Pit2 oligomers. Cross-linking experiments in transport-incompetent Pit2 mutants indicated that structural changes induced by phosphate starvation or supply occur independently of the whole transport cycle. These results suggest that the structural reorganisation of cell-surface Pit2 occurred as a consequence of ion binding, a model consistent with the possible involvement of cell-surface Pit2 oligomers in inorganic phosphate sensing.","['Salaun, Christine', 'Marechal, Valerie', 'Heard, Jean Michel']","['Salaun C', 'Marechal V', 'Heard JM']","['Unite Retrovirus et Transfert Genetique, INSERM U622, Institut Pasteur, 28 Rue du Dr Roux, 75724 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phosphates/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/13 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jmb.2004.04.050 [doi]', 'S002228360400498X [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2004 Jun 25;340(1):39-47. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2004.04.050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have updated our series of patients with ALL and report the results. Additionally, we reviewed the literature and try to embed our own experiences in the published results. We performed HLA-mismatched stem cell transplantations with megadoses of purified positively selected mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells (PBPC) from adult donors in 27 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first (CR1 n = 7), second (CR2 n = 10), or third (CR3 n = 4) complete remission, and in refractory state (NR n = 6). The patients received a mean number of 19.1+/-11.3 x 10(6)/kg purified CD34+ and a mean number of 15.5+/-24.2 x 10(3)/kg CD3+ T-cells. No additional graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was used, except as short-term CSA in the first 3 patients. The myeloablative treatment was based on busulfan in 12 and on TBI in 14 patients. One patient was grafted with a non-myeloablative approach. Engraftment was rapid in 26 patients, with two patients suffering from a rejection. These two and one patient with initial non-engraftment had been successfully regrafted. The probability of survival of the total group is 0.34+/-0.09; the 12 patients transplanted in remission showed a probability of survival of 0.44+/-0.11. None of the patients transplanted in non-remission survived. There was no statistical difference in survival for patients with a 1, 2 or 3 antigen mismatched donor (out of 6 HLA antigens) or for patients in 1st, 2nd or 3rd remission. Causes of death were relapses in 10 patients, veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in 1, multi-organ failure (MOF) in 2 and infections in 4 patients. 3/24 evaluable patients without any additional GVHD-prophylaxis developed grade 1 or 2 GVHD. Ten patients were treated with additional donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), from which 4 developed a maximum grade 3 GVHD. We conclude that the HLA barrier can be overcome by transplantation of megadoses of highly purified CD34+ PBPC and GVHD can effectively be prevented.

Since the first case reported in 1998, more than 3500 patients have received UCB transplants for a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases. The vast majority of recipients were children with an average weight of 20 kg; however, more than 500 UCB transplantations (UCBTs) have already been performed in adults. The ""naive"" nature of UCB lymphocytes also permits the use of HLA-mismatched grafts at 1-2 loci without higher risk for severe graft versus host disease (GvHD) relative to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a full matched unrelated donor. Furthermore, UCB is rich in primitive CD16(-)CD56++ NK cells, which possess impressive proliferative and cytotoxic capacities and can be induced to expand using IL-12 or IL-15, so as to mount a substantial graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect. The main disadvantage of UCB is the low stem cell yields, resulting in higher rates of graft failure as well as delayed time to engraftment compared to BMT. One rational approach to overcome this limitation involves ex vivo expansion of UCB derived hematopoietic precursors. In this review we tried to answer the question: UCBT how, when and for whom. This procedure is mostly applicable for children and especially those with indication for full allogeneic transplantation but who lack a matched sibling donor. Experimental approaches including ex vivo expansion of CB with cocktail of hematopoietic growth factors, with or without differentiation blocking agents, co-transplantation of haploidentical and CB cells or co-transfusion of CB and mesenchymal cells may enable successful UCBT in adults and probably will result in expanding the indication to solid tumors or autoimmune disorders.","['Cohen, Yossi', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Cohen Y', 'Nagler A']","['Institute of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cord Blood Bank, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat-Gan 52621, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",63,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S0268-960X(03)00064-X [doi]', 'S0268960X0300064X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2004 Sep;18(3):167-79. doi: 10.1016/S0268-960X(03)00064-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Randomized trials have demonstrated the equivalence of transfusion triggers of 10,000 and 20,000/microl for prophylactic transfusions. The former threshold is potentially safer for the patient, conservative of donor resources and leads to lower costs, with perhaps a slightly greater risk of minor hemorrhage. Randomized trials have demonstrated the equivalence of pheresis or whole blood-derived platelet transfusions. The former present a lower risk for infectious agents, and the latter are less expensive and a more efficient use of limited donor resources. Randomized trials prove that leukoreduced and ABO identical platelet transfusions reduce the risks of HLA alloimmunization and platelet transfusion refractoriness (both leukoreduction and ABO matching), transfusion reactions (leukoreduction) and CMV transmission (leukoreduction). Leukoreduction and ABO matching of platelet transfusions also have been associated in preliminary observational studies with reduced morbidity and mortality in surgical patients and reduced infections in patients with leukemia.

In vitro modified acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts acquire certain specific features of DC and are suggested as a potential source of anti-leukemia vaccines. AML-DC have been characterized in terms of costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production. In contrast, migratory capacity of AML-DC, which is a major attribute of DC required for their in vivo function, remains unknown. Here we present data on adhesion properties and profile of integrin expression of AML-DC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blasts from nine patients were used to generate AML-DC by calcium ionophore treatment. Adhesion of AML-DC to the major components of the extracellular matrix and the profile of integrin expression was studied using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Similar to their normal counterparts, calcium ionophore-induced AML-DC acquired the ability to bind to fibronectin and in 4 of 7 studied cases to bind to denatured collagen. Adhesion to native collagen remained unchanged during DC-type differentiation of AML blasts. AML-DC and DC obtained from monocytes of healthy donors expressed CD49d, CD49e, alphavbeta3, and alphavbeta5. However, AML-DC from 3 of 8 patients down-regulated CD49d, which plays an important role in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and normally is coexpressed with CD83. CONCLUSION: The results provide further evidence that AML blasts can be induced to display functional properties characteristic for DC and may prove useful for in vivo delivery and presentation of tumor antigens to the immune system. Abnormal CD49d expression and variability in AML-DC adhesion to denatured collagen indicate that motility of AML-DC from individual patients may vary, and a customized approach is essential for evaluating leukemic cell feasibility for vaccine design.","['Sadovnikova, Elena', 'Parovichnikova, Elena N', 'Semikina, Elena L', 'Kopiltsova, Elena A', 'Svinareva, Daria A', 'Belkin, Vladimir M', 'Torubarova, Nadezda A', 'Savchenko, Valeri G']","['Sadovnikova E', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Semikina EL', 'Kopiltsova EA', 'Svinareva DA', 'Belkin VM', 'Torubarova NA', 'Savchenko VG']","['Laboratory Physiology of Haemopoiesis, National Research Centre for Haematology, Moscow, Russia. sadovnikova@blood.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ionophores)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Blast Crisis/*blood/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-D Antigens/blood', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/blood', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*blood', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Reference Values']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/08/12 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.03.004 [doi]', 'S0301472X04000906 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jun;32(6):563-70. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.03.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have found sporadic alterations in the apoptotic apparatus in CLL cells, but a widespread defect has not been detected until now. A crucial checkpoint in the progression of apoptosis is the activity of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) that control the activity of caspases upon the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of IAP in the regulation of apoptosis in CLL cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lysates from CLL cells were prepared, and the regular function of components of the cytochrome c-dependent caspase-activating machinery (the apoptosome) was investigated. The effect of IAP in caspase-inhibition was tested using a peptide derived from the mitochondrial IAP antagonist Smac/DIABLO. Regulation of expression as well as inhibitory function of the X-linked IAP (XIAP) by cytokines was analyzed. RESULTS: The apoptosome was found to be structurally and functionally competent in CLL. XIAP expression was enhanced by culture in the presence of cytokines. Smac/DIABLO was easily detectable in CLL cells and was released into the cytosol during apoptosis. No inhibitory effect of IAP was detected in CLL, irrespective of XIAP levels and culture conditions. CONCLUSION: Although XIAP is present in CLL cells and is up-regulated in conditions where apoptosis is prevented, no caspase-inhibiting anti-apoptotic effect of IAP is detectable. This is likely due to the high expression of Smac/DIABLO in CLL cells that is sufficient to overcome the caspase-inhibiting effect of IAP.","['Schliep, Stefan', 'Decker, Thomas', 'Schneller, Folker', 'Wagner, Hermann', 'Hacker, Georg']","['Schliep S', 'Decker T', 'Schneller F', 'Wagner H', 'Hacker G']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/08/12 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.03.006 [doi]', 'S0301472X0400092X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jun;32(6):556-62. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.03.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells express VEGF and one or both VEGF-A receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2). To evaluate receptor-selective trophic response to VEGF-A in AML cells, we investigated receptor-specific ligand activation responsible for VEGF-initiated clonogenic response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using KG1 (VEGFR-1+/VEGFR-2+) and HL60 (VEGFR-1+) cells with differential VEGF receptor display, we investigated ligand-induced clonogenic response and receptor-initiated signaling after stimulation with VEGF-A, the VEGFR-1 selective ligand placental growth factor (PlGF), or receptor-specific antibody agonists. RESULTS: Recombinant human (rhu)-VEGF increased S-phase fraction and stimulated colony formation in both KG1 and HL60 cells. Ligation of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 with receptor-specific antibody agonists triggered equivalent and concentration-dependent stimulation of colony recovery in KG1 cells, whereas clonogenic response in HL60 cells was restricted to VEGFR-1 activation by antibody or PlGF. In serum-deprived KG1 and HL60 cells, rhu-VEGF stimulated rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Akt/PKB that was inhibited by the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Preincubation with wortmannin inhibited VEGF-induced colony formation in a concentration-dependent fashion. rhu-VEGF-induced clonogenic response and Akt phosphorylation was abolished by the VEGF-RTK inhibitor SU-5416 at concentrations greater than 10 microM, whereas MEK inhibition by PD98059 (1 and 10 microM) was ineffective. In vivo suppression of Akt phosphorylation was confirmed in myeloblast lysates from three patients with advanced myeloid malignancies treated with SU5416. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that VEGF interaction with either VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 initiates a clonogenic response in AML cells that is PI3-kinase dependent. RTK inhibitors with broad specificity for angiogenic receptors represent novel therapeutics that merit further clinical investigation in AML.","['List, Alan F', 'Glinsmann-Gibson, Betty', 'Stadheim, Chad', 'Meuillet, Emmanuelle J', 'Bellamy, William', 'Powis, Garth']","['List AF', 'Glinsmann-Gibson B', 'Stadheim C', 'Meuillet EJ', 'Bellamy W', 'Powis G']","['The H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Terminally differentiated megakaryocytes derived from circulating stem cells in serum-free medium supplemented with stem cell factor and thrombopoietin were processed for electron microscopic immunostaining using a monoclonal antibody against the gag protein of HERV-K10 and an electron dense gold-labeled secondary antibody. RESULTS: We found that HERV-K gag protein was detected as clusters in the cytoplasm as well as associated with viral particles budding from the cell membrane and into intracellular vacuoles in megakaryocytes from two patients with essential thrombocythemia. None of these structures was observed in megakaryocytes from a normal control or from a patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence of HERV-K protein synthesis (gene translation) in human tissue other than seminomas, placenta, or fetal tissue. Translation of the HERV-K gag gene with subsequent packaging of the protein product into viral particles adds a new and important dimension to future studies on the role of HERVs in the myeloproliferative diseases.","['Morgan, Doris', 'Brodsky, Isadore']","['Morgan D', 'Brodsky I']","['Drexel University College of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Philadelphia, Pa. 19102, USA. doris.morgan@drexel.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Stem Cells/pathology/ultrastructure/virology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*blood/pathology/*virology']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/08/12 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.exphem.2004.03.003 [doi]', 'S0301472X0400089X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2004 Jun;32(6):520-5. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2004.03.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absolute numbers of benzidine-positive cells induced with either DMSO or WEHI-3-conditioned medium were comparable. Terminal differentiation was not observed. An expression library from WEHI-3 RNA aided by PCR cloning revealed an open reading frame corresponding to a 209 amino acid protein. This was 100% identical to a sequence from human stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast to human RNA, mouse RNA exhibited multiple bands of pre-mRNA in Northern blots. The gene was provisionally termed erythroid differentiation regulator (edr). In mammalian cells EDR is mostly expressed as a 56 kDa dimer showing higher activity than the recombinant monomer. The activity profile is bell-shaped. Expression was observed in many normal mouse tissues, yet in haematopoiesis it was largely confined to CD34+ cells. It was enhanced by a series of stimuli such as phorbol ester, and transformed cells generally showed a higher level of EDR expression than normal ones. The protein is localized at the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane and is released in part via vesicles. In view of the broad range of EDR-expressing tissues the function obviously exceeds haemoglobin synthesis induction. Involvement in cell survival and growth control has been observed and will be dealt with in detail elsewhere.","['Dormer, Peter', 'Spitzer, Elisabeth', 'Frankenberger, Marion', 'Kremmer, Elisabeth']","['Dormer P', 'Spitzer E', 'Frankenberger M', 'Kremmer E']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, GSF--National Research Center for Environment and Health, Robert-Koch-Allee 29, D-82131 Gauting, Germany. doermer@gsf.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (erythroid differentiation regulator 1, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cyto.2004.02.005 [doi]', 'S1043466604000663 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2004 Jun 21;26(6):231-42. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2004.02.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed the data of 368 patients. Of these, 66 received mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) and 302 received doxorubicin (or epirubicin), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine [A(E)BVD]. Patients with complete remission or very good partial remission were scheduled for low-dose IFRT (< or =3200 cGy). RESULTS: The 10-year failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) rate was 85% and 86%, respectively. A(E)BVD-treated patients had superior 10-year FFS and OS rates compared with MOPP-treated patients (87% vs. 75%, p = 0.009; and 93% vs. 71%, p = 0.0004, respectively). Only 10 of 41 relapses had any infield (irradiated) component. Of the complete responders/very good partial responders treated with low-dose IFRT, those who received <2800 cGy had inferior FFS but similar OS as those who received 2800-3200 cGy. Adverse prognostic factors for FFS included age > or =45 years, leukocytosis > or =10 x 10(9)/L, and extranodal extension. Secondary acute leukemia developed after MOPP with or without salvage therapy (n = 6) or after ABVD plus salvage therapy (n = 2).

Recent studies indicate that dCK activity might be regulated through reversible phosphorylation. Here, we report the effects of a large panel of protein kinase inhibitors on dCK activity in the B-leukemia cell line EHEB, both in basal conditions and in the presence of the nucleoside analogue 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA) which induces activation of dCK. Except staurosporine and H-7 that significantly reduced the activation of dCK by CdA, no specific protein kinase inhibitor diminished basal dCK activity or its activation by CdA. In contrast, genistein, a general protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and AG-490, an inhibitor of JAK2 and JAK3, increased basal dCK activity more than two-fold. Two specific inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK pathway, PD-98059 and U-0126, also enhanced dCK activity. These data suggest that the JAK/MAPK pathway could be involved in the regulation of dCK. Moreover, we show that the activity of dCK, raised by CdA, can return to its initial level by treatment with protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A). Accordingly, dCK activity in intact cells increased upon incubation with okadaic acid (OA) at concentrations that should inhibit PP2A, but not protein phosphatase-1. Activation of dCK by protein kinase inhibitors and OA was also observed in CCRF-CEM cells and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-lymphocytes, suggesting a general mechanism of post-translational regulation of dCK, which could be exploited to enhance the activation of antileukemic nucleoside analogues.","['Smal, Caroline', 'Cardoen, Sabine', 'Bertrand, Luc', 'Delacauw, Anne', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Van den Berghe, Georges', 'Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Bontemps, Francoise']","['Smal C', 'Cardoen S', 'Bertrand L', 'Delacauw A', 'Ferrant A', 'Van den Berghe G', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Bontemps F']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology, Avenue Hippocrate 75, UCL-ICP 7539, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (protein kinase modulator)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Okadaic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.02.031 [doi]', 'S000629520400156X [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Jul 1;68(1):95-103. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.02.031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although recent studies have demonstrated its antitumour activities on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated. Hence, the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro cytotoxic activities of a standardized aqueous ethanol extract prepared from Coriolus versicolor on a B-cell lymphoma (Raji) and two human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60, NB-4) cell lines using a MTT cytotoxicity assay, and to test whether the mechanism involves induction of apoptosis. Cell death ELISA was employed to quantify the nucleosome production resulting from nuclear DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. The present results demonstrated that CV extract at 50 to 800 microg/ml dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of Raji, NB-4, and HL-60 cells by more than 90% (p < 0.01), with ascending order of IC50 values: HL-60 (147.3 +/- 15.2 microg/ml), Raji (253.8 +/- 60.7 microg/ml) and NB-4 (269.3 +/- 12.4 microg/ml). The extract however did not exert any significant cytotoxic effect on normal liver cell line WRL (IC50 > 800 microg/ml) when compared with a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug, mitomycin C (MMC), confirming the tumour-selective cytotoxicity. Nucleosome productions in HL-60, NB-4 and Raji cells were significantly increased by 3.6-, 3.6- and 5.6-fold respectively upon the treatment of CV extract, while no significant nucleosome production was detected in extract-treated WRL cells. The CV extract was found to selectively and dose-dependently inhibit the proliferation of lymphoma and leukemic cells possibly via an apoptosis-dependent pathway.","['Lau, C B S', 'Ho, C Y', 'Kim, C F', 'Leung, K N', 'Fung, K P', 'Tse, T F', 'Chan, H H L', 'Chow, M S S']","['Lau CB', 'Ho CY', 'Kim CF', 'Leung KN', 'Fung KP', 'Tse TF', 'Chan HH', 'Chow MS']","['School of Pharmacy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong. claralau@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.lfs.2004.04.001 [doi]', 'S0024320504003248 [pii]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2004 Jul 2;75(7):797-808. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2004.04.001.,,['Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, proviral DNA of the ecotropic Cas-Br-E strain of MuLV was modified by substitution or deletion of the critical tyrosine residue. Mutant viruses lost basolateral targeting in polarized MDCK epithelial cells while expression level of the glycoprotein at the cell surface was not affected.

This consideration makes it imperative to dissect further the biological mechanisms of disease, in order to selectively implement an hitherto unsatisfactory success rate. The recognition of discrete ALL subtypes (some of which deserve specific therapeutic approaches, like T-lineage ALL (T-ALL) and mature B-lineage ALL (B-ALL)) is possible through an accurate combination of cytomorphology, immunophenotytpe and cytogenetic assays and has been a major result of clinical research studies conducted over the past 20 years. Two-three major prognostic groups are now easily identifiable, with a survival probability ranging from <10 to 20% (Philadelphia-positive ALL) to about 50-60% (low-risk T-ALL and selected patients with B-lineage ALL). These issues are extensively reviewed and form the basis of current knowledge. The second major point relates to the emerging importance of studies that reveal a dysregulated gene activity and its clinical counterpart. It is now clear that prognostication is a complex matter ranging from patient-related issues to cytogenetics to molecular biology, including the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) and possibly gene array tests. On these bases, the role of a correct, highly personalised therapeutic choice will soon become fundamental.

This review conveys the many facets of this progress, focusing on diagnostic subsets, risk classes, newer biological issues and conventional as well as innovative therapeutic interventions with or without autologous/allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Smith, Matthew', 'Barnett, Michael', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Gatta, Gemma', 'Tondini, Carlo', 'Kern, Wolfgang']","['Smith M', 'Barnett M', 'Bassan R', 'Gatta G', 'Tondini C', 'Kern W']","[""St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",221,2004/06/09 05:00,2005/01/04 09:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.critrevonc.2003.11.002 [doi]', 'S1040842803002695 [pii]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2004 Jun;50(3):197-222. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2003.11.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Molecular cloning technology was used to construct NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic plasmid and NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice were generated. The genotype and phenotype of the NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice were analyzed by PCR, RT-PCR and colony-forming assay. The effect of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) stimulation on the transgenic mice was analyzed by peripheral blood count, bone marrow (BM) cells morphology pathological examination. RESULTS: The transgenic expression was detected in 5 independent lines of NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice, but no expected phenotypes was found in 2 year follow-up. Upon ENU stimulation, 2 of 10 transgenic mice developed myeloid leukemia, suggesting that NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice have increased susceptibility to ENU mutagenesis in leukemogenesis. CONCLUSION: The fusion gene expressed in BM cells of NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice. It seems that the expression of the fusion gene is insufficient to trigger leukemogenesis.

However, rare cases of childhood ALL and various other hematological diseases with t(1;19) lack the E2A-PBX1 fusion. Analyzing a cell line with pre-B-cell phenotype, TS-2, that carries t(1;19)(q23;p13) but lacks the E2A-PBX1 fusion, we successfully cloned the breakpoints, which fell within introns of MEF2D and DAZAP1. Both chimeric transcripts, MEF2D-DAZAP1 and DAZAP1-MEF2D, whose sequences indicated in-frame fusions between MEF2D and DAZAP1, were expressed in TS-2 cells and in bone-marrow cells of the patient from whom the TS-2 was established. MEF2D-DAZAP1 and DAZAP1-MEF2D proteins were both located in the nucleus, and MEF2D-DAZAP1 was able to form dimers with MEF2D and HDAC4. In addition, exogenous expression of MEF2D-DAZAP1 and DAZAP1-MEF2D promoted the growth of HeLa cells. Given the frequency of t(1;19) without the E2A-PBX1 fusion in hematological malignancies, we suggest that MEF2D / DAZAP1 rearrangements might be involved in the pathogenesis of those diseases.","['Yuki, Yasuhiro', 'Imoto, Issei', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Hibi, Shigeyoshi', 'Kaneko, Yasuhiko', 'Amagasa, Teruo', 'Inazawa, Johji']","['Yuki Y', 'Imoto I', 'Imaizumi M', 'Hibi S', 'Kaneko Y', 'Amagasa T', 'Inazawa J']","['Department of Molecular Cytogenetics, Medical Research Institute, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DAZAP1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MADS Domain Proteins)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2D protein, human)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MADS Domain Proteins', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03240.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2004 Jun;95(6):503-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03240.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, a proportion of T lymphomas/leukemias in strains that do not express TL in the thymus (TL(-) strains) feature TL as a tumor antigen. TL was originally defined serologically, but subsequently we have succeeded in generating T cell receptor (TCR) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognizing TL. By use of TL tetramers free from peptides and transfectants expressing various TL/H-2 chimeric molecules, we have been able to show that TL-specific CTL recognize the alpha1/alpha2 domain of TL without any additional antigen molecules. We previously reported that one of TL's functions in the thymus is positive selection of TCR CTL. Recent studies with TL tetramers revealed that they can bind to normal intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIEL) and thymocytes in a CD8-dependent, but TCR/CD3-independent manner, while their binding to TL-specific CTL is TCR/CD3- and CD8-dependent. The possible significance of these findings in relation to the roles of TL in the intestines is discussed. We have long been interested in TL as a model tumor antigen which shares characteristics with human differentiation tumor antigens, and we have demonstrated that growth of TL(+) lymphoma cells in vivo is suppressed by immunization with TL(+) skin or dendritic cells (DC) from TL transgenic mice. In addition, anti-tumor effects against TL(+) T lymphomas were obtained by adoptive transfer of TL tetramer strongly-positive TL-specific CTLs.","['Tsujimura, Kunio', 'Obata, Yuichi', 'Takahashi, Toshitada']","['Tsujimura K', 'Obata Y', 'Takahashi T']","['Division of Immunology and Director, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan. ktsujimu@aichi-cc.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', '*Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Vaccination']",36,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03234.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2004 Jun;95(6):469-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03234.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiology remains unclear, but an association with preceding blood transfusions or bacterial infections has been reported. Triggered immune responses are suggested to play a potential role in the development of spontaneous remission. Acute monocytic leukemia was diagnosed in a 61-yr-old male patient. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a sole translocation (9;11) (q22;q23) and RT-PCR the MLL/AF9 fusion gene. As a result of the patient's reduced performance status and septic condition, cytostatic therapy was withheld. No microorganisms could be detected. Hematologic and molecular remission occurred after initiating antibiotic therapy without any cytostatic treatment; 29 months after the initial diagnosis, he is in complete remission, and excellent physical condition. Our report includes a review of the literature since 1985, reporting cases of patients with AML and spontaneous remission together with informative cytogenetics. Balanced translocations such as in core binding factor (CBF) leukemias appear somewhat overrepresented.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The diagnoses were acute leukemia (7), myelodysplastic syndrome (1) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (1). All patients developed an invasive mycosis (proven, 3; probable, 6; and possible, 1) refractory to first-line antifungal treatment (liposomal amphotericin B in all patients except one who received fluconazole). RESULTS: Rescue therapy with a combination of caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B was well tolerated, hypokalemia, and thrombophlebitis being the most common side-effects. Combination therapy was administered for a median of 17 d, range 6-40. Among the nine patients with proven or probable mycosis, one was not evaluated because of early death caused by massive hemoptysis whilst in the remaining eight patients, the response was classified as complete, stable and failure in four, three, and one patients, respectively. Complete response was also observed in patient with possible mycosis. Eight of nine patients received voriconazole for a median of 75 d, range 42-194. Voriconazole was well tolerated although some drug interactions were observed during treatment with methotrexate and digoxin. After a median follow-up of 125 d, nine of 10 patients are alive. Overall, a favorable response to antifungal treatment (including the case of possible mycosis) was obtained in eight of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that medical antifungal treatment may be intensified in severely ill patients without significantly compromising patient safety. The combination of synergistic antifungal drugs as well as their sequential use warrants further investigation by a larger randomized controlled study.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Toffolutti, Tiziana', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Calore, Elisabetta', 'Alaggio, Rita', 'Cusinato, Riccardo', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Zanesco, Luigi']","['Cesaro S', 'Toffolutti T', 'Messina C', 'Calore E', 'Alaggio R', 'Cusinato R', 'Pillon M', 'Zanesco L']","['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Padova, Italy. simone.cesaro@unipd.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Caspofungin', 'Child', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Geotrichosis/drug therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lipopeptides', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Peptides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Voriconazole']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00254.x [doi]', 'EJH254 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jul;73(1):50-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00254.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an ELISA technique (Quantikine Human Angiogenin Immunoassay; R&D Systems), we measured serum angiogenin levels in 77 previously untreated Binet stage A B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. No difference in angiogenin serum levels could be found between patients (median: 295 ng/mL; range: 74-1700) and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (median: 264 ng/mL; range: 29-1835) (P = NS; Mann-Whitney test). Increased angiogenin serum level was associated with higher LDH (P = 0.03) and beta2-m (P = 0.007) concentrations. However, angiogenin did not reflect the extent of bone marrow (BM) angiogenesis as evaluated by microvessel area (P = 0.611), circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (P = 0.873) and basic fibroblastic growth factor (FGF-2) (P = 0.421). When the 25 patients with available data were stratified into the four major cytogenetic categories (normal karyotype, 13q as a sole aberration, 12q trisomy, 11q or 17p deletion) and aberrations were compared with angiogenin serum levels, no correlation was found (P = 0.651; Kruskall-Wallis test). A cut-off of angiogenin serum level corresponding to median (i.e. 330 ng/mL) or higher identified later upstaging and longer progression-free survival (PFS). The 5-yr PFS was 51.5% for patients with angiogenin levels lower than median and 85% for patients with higher values [P = 0.03; hazard ratio (HR) = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.08-6.72]. Although in multivariate analysis only Rai substages (P = 0.00001) and peripheral blood lymphocytosis (P = 0.009) retained their prognostic significance, angiogenin could be incorporated into the Rai substages thus leading to the identification of the following risk categories: (i) stage 0 (angionenin >330 ng/mL); (ii) stage 0 (angiogenin <330 ng/mL) + stage I-II (angiogenin >330 ng/mL); and (iii) stage I-II (angiogenin <330 ng/mL).

In conclusion, serum angiogenin levels although not increased in comparison with healthy controls, may predict clinical outcome of patients with early CLL and help to refine Rai's stratification.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Vitelli, Gaetano', 'Levato, Domenico', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Vacca, Angelo', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Ribatti, Domenico', 'Digiesi, Giovanna']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Levato D', 'Giannarelli D', 'Vacca A', 'Cuneo A', 'Ribatti D', 'Digiesi G']","[""Medical Oncology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera 'Pugliese-Ciaccio', Catanzaro, Rome, Italy. smolica@libero.it""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (angiogenin)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/blood', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/*blood', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00269.x [doi]', 'EJH269 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jul;73(1):36-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00269.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among different cytokines of question interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is indicated to prevent malignant cells from entering apoptosis. The aim of the study was to determine IFN-gamma production capacity of T-cell subsets and B lymphocytes in B-CLL patients in comparison with healthy individuals and during disease progression. Forty patients with newly diagnosed, untreated B-CLL and 20 healthy individuals were studied. The two- and three-colour flow cytometry techniques were used to detect intracellular cytokine expression. We detected statistically significantly higher percentage of both CD3+/CD4+/IFN-gamma+ and CD3+/CD8+/IFN-gamma+ in patients than in controls (P < 0.001 in both cases). Moreover the percentage of CD3+/CD8+/IFN-gamma+ cells correlated with stage of the disease (R = 0.39, P = 0.01) and parameters of disease progression like lymphocyte count and total tumour mass score (R = 0.33, P = 0.03 and R = 0.31, P = 0.04, respectively). By contrast, the percentage of CD19+/IFN-gamma+ cells in B-CLL group was lower than in controls (P < 0.01). These findings indicate that T-cell populations rather than malignant B cells are the source of IFN-gamma in B-CLL patients. The subset of CD3+/CD8+ cells expressing IFN-gamma seems to play a special role in the disease progression and more precise investigation should elucidate its role as a prognostic marker in B-CLL and a target for therapeutic strategies.","['Podhorecka, Monika', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Rolinski, Jacek']","['Podhorecka M', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Rolinski J']","['Department of Haematology, University School of Medicine in Lublin, Jaczewskiego, Lublin, Poland. mpodhor@asklepios.am.lublin.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*chemistry/immunology', 'Neoplasm Staging']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00258.x [doi]', 'EJH258 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jul;73(1):29-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00258.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cobble stone area forming cells (CAFC) were assayed in normal BM and BM after allogeneic BMT and PBSCT after stable engraftment. Groups were compared by two-tailed t-test. RESULTS: While BM from 11 normal controls contained an average of 778.8 CAFC-d35 per 10(6) low density bone marrow cells (LDBMC, range 453-1231 per 10(6) LDBMC), BM from patients after BMT contained an average of 123.7 CAFC-d35 per 10(6) LDBMC (range 38-257) per 10(6) LDBMC. BM from patients transplanted with PBSC after myeloablative conditioning contained 128.3 (range 46-305) CAFC-d35 per 10(6) LDBMC (P = 0.89 compared with BMT). Similar results were obtained when patients after PBSCT with non-myeloablative conditioning were included (P = 0.62 compared with BMT). CAFC numbers in patients transplanted in early stages of myeloid leukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia first remission, chronic myeloid leukaemia first chronic phase) were significantly higher than CAFC numbers in patients transplanted in more advanced stages (P = 0.008) or myelodysplastic syndrome (P = 0.023). The lowest CAFC numbers were found in two cases of retransplantation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the functional state of the BM microenvironment rather than stem cell dose or source is limiting for the homing and engraftment of immature haemopoietic cells in clinical transplantation.","['Novotny, J R', 'Rosenthal, C', 'Elmaagacli, A H', 'Durig, J', 'Beelen, D W', 'Duhrsen, U']","['Novotny JR', 'Rosenthal C', 'Elmaagacli AH', 'Durig J', 'Beelen DW', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Haematology, University of Essen, Essen, Germany. juergen.novotny@medizin.uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/etiology/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2004/06/09 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/09 05:00'],"['2004/06/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00255.x [doi]', 'EJH255 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jul;73(1):1-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00255.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and complications of IV busulfan in pediatric patients. METHODS: Three pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia were treated by intravenous busulfan combined with cyclophosphamide to compare retrospectively with the treatment with oral busulfan plus intravenous cyclophosphamide in another three pediatric cases having transplantation in the same institute. RESULTS: The results showed that the intravenous busulfan-based regimen had better compliance and less adverse effects including mucositis, hepatic toxicity, transplant-related hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and acute graft-versus-host disease than oral busulfan-based treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The conditioning regimen of intravenous busulfan combined with cyclophosphamide is an acceptable alternative for pediatric patients with hematological malignancies in Taiwan.

Its significance as a marker of disease activity in pediatric malignancies has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the pre-treatment serum levels of beta 2-M in children suffering from neoplastic disease. The study was conducted in 61 children (28 girls and 33 boys) aged from 2.0 to 16.9 years at the time of disease diagnosis. The study group consisted of 6 common types of childhood malignancies: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL--22 patients), acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL--3), Hodgkin's disease (HD--12), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL--6) and malignant solid tumors: Wilms' tumor (Tu Wilms--10) and soft tissue sarcomas (SA--8). The control group consisted of 30 healthy children. Different behavior of beta 2-Microglobulin levels depending on histological type of the neoplasm was observed. The pre-treatment levels of analyzed marker in children with lymphoproliferative disorders (acute leukemias and lymphomas) were significantly elevated as compared to the levels in the healthy controls (median: 2.90 vs. 2.05 mg/L, p < 0.001). On the contrary, in patients with malignant solid tumors (Wilms tumor and soft tissue sarcomas) the median levels of beta 2-M at diagnosis were within normal range. Elevated values of serum beta 2-M were stated in the majority (67%) of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and in 39% of patients with malignant solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: beta 2-Microglobulin may serve as an additional diagnostic marker in children with leukemias and lymphomas.

Generally, anthracycline-containing regimens are superior to non-anthracycline regimens, treatments longer than 6 months are not advantageous and high-dose chemotherapy regimens, which require autologous hematopoietic stem cell support, have not proved consistently superior. The development and evaluation of the taxanes was highly anticipated as they have shown high levels of efficacy while appearing to be non-cross-resistant with partially non-overlapping toxicities. A role for taxanes in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is now widely acknowledged, although they are not currently approved for treatment of early breast cancer in Europe. In patients with aggressive lymphoma who receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy, 40% to 70% of patients attain a complete remission, depending on risk factors such as age and extranodal involvement. Second- and third-generation regimens like m-BACOD (methotrexate, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide), Pro-MACE-CytaBOM (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate), and MACOP-B (methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin) have largely failed to improve treatment outcome. The use of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies or dose escalation have shown promising results in improving relapse-free and survival rates. In patients with breast cancer, the key Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9741 trial showed that dose-dense doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), repeated every 2 weeks, is superior to the same regimen administered at standard 3-weekly intervals. In lymphoma, dose-dense CHOP chemotherapy has shown superiority over standard CHOP regimens, particularly in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. G-CSF factor is essential to enable the administration of dose-dense chemotherapy and any reduction in its use leads to significant increases in infectious complications. Current evidence suggests that dose-dense chemotherapy, enabled by G-CSF, is an important breakthrough in the evolution of chemotherapy for breast cancer and lymphoma.","['Hudis, Clifford A', 'Schmitz, Norbert']","['Hudis CA', 'Schmitz N']","['Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",33,2004/06/08 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/06/08 05:00'],"['2004/06/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0093775404001988 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2004.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2004 Jun;31(3 Suppl 8):19-26. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2004.04.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the inhibition of the HPA axis by dexamethasone in children and adolescents with acute lymphoid leukemia. Thirty-five patients (median age of 6.9 yr) were evaluated. A stimulus test with ovine CRH (1 microg/kg) was performed before the introduction of dexamethasone (6 mg/m2.d for 28 d), in the 8th and 28th days of glucocorticoid therapy, and 48 h and 1 month after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Suppression of the basal secretion as well as the maximum concentration of ACTH occurred during glucocorticoid therapy (P < 0.01). The pituitary function before the introduction of dexamethasone was similar to the one seen 48 h and 1 month after withdrawing it. Suppression of the adrenal function was detected during glucocorticoid therapy, which persisted for 48 h after the steroid was removed from treatment (P < 0.01). One month after ceasing the administration of the glucocorticoid, the adrenal function was similar to that before glucocorticoid therapy. According to these results, a clinical and laboratory follow-up of the HPA axis in the month after the cessation of dexamethasone therapy is suggested to determine glucocorticoid replacement.","['Cunha, Cristiane de Freitas', 'Silva, Ivani Novato', 'Finch, Francisca Lee']","['Cunha Cde F', 'Silva IN', 'Finch FL']","['Dvision of Pediatric Endocrinology, University Hospital, Federal University of Minas Gerais, 30130-100 Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",,2004/06/08 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/06/08 05:00'],"['2004/06/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/jc.2003-031165 [doi]', '89/6/2797 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004 Jun;89(6):2797-802. doi: 10.1210/jc.2003-031165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However LIF is not required for post-implantation development of mouse embryo. The objective of this study was to examine the role of LIF system in post-implantation stage of human pregnancy. METHODS: Tissues from 25 patients with anembryonic pregnancy (AP; blighted ovum) and 25 matched patients with normal pregnancy (NP) were collected. LIF and its receptor beta (LIF-Rbeta) expression in the decidua and chorionic villi were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical study. RESULTS: LIF mRNA levels were not different either between different tissues (decidua vs chorionic villi) or between different patients (NP vs AP). LIF-Rbeta mRNA levels were significantly higher in chorionic villi than in decidua but were not different between NP and AP. Immunohistochemical staining supported these findings and showed a predominate expression of LIF-Rbeta in the trophoblast cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that at early human post-implantation stage, LIF is produced from both decidua and chorionic villi and may exert its major action on trophoblasts. A baseline expression of LIF and LIF-Rbeta is probably needed for early pregnancy, but AP cannot be accounted for by the defective expression of either LIF or LIF-Rbeta in most circumstances.","['Chen, Hsin-Fu', 'Chao, Kuang-Han', 'Shew, Jin-Yuh', 'Yang, Yu-Shih', 'Ho, Hong-Nerng']","['Chen HF', 'Chao KH', 'Shew JY', 'Yang YS', 'Ho HN']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine and the Hospital, National Taiwan University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chorionic Villi/*metabolism', 'Computer Systems', 'Decidua/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF']",,2004/06/08 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/06/08 05:00'],"['2004/06/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/humrep/deh193 [doi]', 'deh193 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2004 Jul;19(7):1647-54. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deh193.

Parametric tests, such as two-sample t-tests, may be used to identify differentially expressed genes, but they require some assumptions that are not realistic for many practical problems. Non-parametric tests, such as empirical Bayes methods and mixture normal approaches, have been proposed, but the inferences are complicated and the tests may not have as much power as parametric models. RESULTS: We propose a weakly parametric method to model the distributions of summary statistics that are used to detect differentially expressed genes. Standard maximum likelihood methods can be employed to make inferences. For illustration purposes the proposed method is applied to the leukemia data (training part) discussed elsewhere.

In 20-30% of cases, it reoccurs as progressive acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL) at 2-4 years of age. The TMD and AMKL blasts are morphologically and immuno-phenotypically identical, and have the same acquired mutations in GATA1. We performed transcript profiling of nine TMD patients comparing them with seven AMKL patients using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays. Similar overall transcript profiles were observed between the two conditions, which were only separable by supervised clustering. Taqman analysis on 10 TMD and 10 AMKL RNA samples verified the expression of selected differing genes, with statistical significance (P < 0.05) by Student's t-test. The Taqman differences were also reproduced on TMD and AMKL blasts sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Among the significant differences, CDKN2C, the effector of GATA1-mediated cell cycle arrest, was increased in AMKL but not TMD, despite the similar level of GATA1. In contrast, MYCN (neuroblastoma-derived oncogene) was expressed in TMD at a significantly greater level than in AMKL. MYCN has not previously been described in leukaemogenesis. Finally, the tumour antigen PRAME was identified as a specific marker for AMKL blasts, with no expression in TMD. This study provides markers discriminating TMD from AMKL-M7 in DS. These markers have the potential as predictive, diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) represents a potential good target for these approaches. The present study was designed to investigate the feasibility of generating in vitro fully functional DCs from peripheral blood (PB) monocytes of CLL patients at different phases of the disease. Although functional DCs could be obtained from CLL samples, in patients with active disease the expression of some co-stimulatory molecules appeared to be reduced. In contrast, DCs from CLL patients in remission showed no difference from those of normal controls. Moreover, patients with active disease produced DCs with reduced allostimulatory ability when compared with normal ones, whereas the functional capacities appeared to be restored in CLL DCs from remission patients. To more precisely assess the possible inhibitory effect of CLL cells on DC development, the influence of autologous leukaemic CD19(+) cells on the generation of monocyte-derived CLL DCs in vitro was investigated.

Point mutations of this gene have also recently been associated with leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). To further define the frequency and biological characteristics of AML1 mutations, we have examined 170 cases of such diseases. Mutations within the runt-domain were identified in five cases: one of de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and four of MDS. Where multiple time point samples were available, mutations were detected in the earliest samples, which persisted throughout the disease course. Of the five mutations, one was a silent mutation, two were apparent loss-of-function mutations caused by N-terminal truncation, and two were insertions, I150ins and K168ins, which preserved most of the AML1 DNA-binding domain. Both AML1 molecules with insertion mutations were non-functional in that they were unable to rescue haematological defects in AML1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells. In addition, activating mutations of N-ras, deletion of chromosome 12p, or inactivation of TP53 accompanied some of the AML1 mutations. Together, these observations strongly suggest that one-allele inactivation of AML1 serves as an initial or early event that plays an important role in the eventual development of overt diseases with additional genetic alterations.","['Nakao, Mitsushige', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Fukushima-Nakase, Yoko', 'Nishimura, Motohiro', 'Fujita, Yasuko', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Okuda, Tsukasa']","['Nakao M', 'Horiike S', 'Fukushima-Nakase Y', 'Nishimura M', 'Fujita Y', 'Taniwaki M', 'Okuda T']","['Molecular-Targeting Cancer Prevention, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kawaramach-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2004/06/08 05:00,2004/07/17 05:00,['2004/06/08 05:00'],"['2004/06/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04966.x [doi]', 'BJH4966 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Jun;125(6):709-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04966.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of Flt3 by different types of mutations plays an important role for proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and prevention of differentiation of leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At least one type of such mutations - an internal tandem duplication in the Flt3 juxtamembrane domain (Flt3-ITD) - has been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Signal transduction of Flt3 involves activation of several conserved pathways, including the RAS/MAP-Kinase and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt signaling cascades. Transforming versions of Flt3 exhibit altered signaling, for example a very pronounced activation of STAT5, ultimately resulting in alternate profiles of gene expression and cell transformation. Selective inhibitors of Flt3 tyrosine kinase activity have the potential to suppress aberrant Flt3 signaling. Although highly homologous to other class III RTKs, Flt3 is resistant to the phenylaminopyrimidine STI571 (Gleevec, Imatinib), a potent inhibitor of other RTKs in the family, such as the PDGFbeta-receptor or c-Kit. STI571 binding to Flt3 is prevented by the phenylalanine 691 side-chain in the ATP binding center and mutating this site to threonine renders the corresponding Flt3 mutant sensitive to STI571. Compounds of several other structural families, including the quinoxaline AG1296, the bis(1H-2-indolyl)-1-methanone D-65476, the indolinones SU5416 and SU11248, the indolocarbazoles PKC412 and CEP-701, and the piperazonyl quinazoline CT53518, are potent inhibitors of Flt3 kinase. They exhibit different selectivity profiles, both with respect to other kinases and among wildtype Flt3 and its activated versions. These compounds hold promise as novel drugs against AML and as probes for understanding activation mechanisms and signaling pathways in the class III RTK family.","['Schmidt-Arras, Dirk', 'Schwable, Joachim', 'Bohmer, Frank-D', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Schmidt-Arras D', 'Schwable J', 'Bohmer FD', 'Serve H']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Medical Faculty, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",162,2004/06/08 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/06/08 05:00'],"['2004/06/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612043384394 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2004;10(16):1867-83. doi: 10.2174/1381612043384394.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considerable variation exists in cancer mortality between the sexes and among different racial/ethnic populations and geographic locations. The description of mortality data by state, sex, and race/ethnicity is essential for cancer-control researchers to target areas of need and develop programs that reduce the burden of cancer. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 1990-2000. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Mortality data from CDC were used to calculate death rates and trends, categorized by state, sex, and race/ethnicity. Trend analyses for 1990-2000 are presented for all cancer sites combined and for the four leading cancers causing death (lung/bronchus, colorectal, prostate, and breast) categorized by state, sex, and race/ethnicity. Death rates per 100,000 population for the 10 primary cancer sites with the highest age-adjusted rates are also presented for each state and the District of Columbia by sex. For males, the 10 primary sites include lung/bronchus, prostate, colon/rectum, pancreas, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, esophagus, stomach, and urinary bladder. For females, the 10 primary sites include lung/bronchus, breast, colon/rectum, pancreas, ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain/other nervous system, uterine corpus, and myeloma. RESULTS: For 1990-2000, cancer mortality decreased among the majority of racial/ethnic populations and geographic locations in the United States. Statistically significant decreases in mortality among all races combined occurred with lung and bronchus cancer among men (--1.7%/year); colorectal cancer among men and women (--2.0%/year and--1.7%/year, respectively); prostate cancer (--2.6%/year); and female breast cancer (--2.3%/year). For 1990-2000, cancer mortality remained stable among American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Statistically significant increases in lung and bronchus cancer mortality occurred among women of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, except among Asian/Pacific Islanders. INTERPRETATION: Although cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, the overall declining trend in cancer mortality demonstrates considerable progress in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: More effective tobacco-cessation programs are necessary to reduce lung and bronchus cancer mortality among women and sustain the decrease in lung and bronchus cancer mortality among men. Additional programs that deter smoking initiation among adolescents are essential to ensure future decreases in lung and bronchus cancer mortality. Continued research in primary prevention, screening methods, and therapeutics is needed to further reduce disparities and improve quality of life and survival among all populations.","['Stewart, Sherri L', 'King, Jessica B', 'Thompson, Trevor D', 'Friedman, Carol', 'Wingo, Phyllis A']","['Stewart SL', 'King JB', 'Thompson TD', 'Friedman C', 'Wingo PA']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,MMWR Surveill Summ,"Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

JAK3, a member of JAK kinase family of four (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2), is abundantly expressed in lymphoid cells. JAK3 has been found to initiate signaling of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13 and IL-15. Indispensable role of JAK3 in lymphocyte development and function has been revealed recently. Because of the involvement of JAK3 in T cell activation and proliferation, and the documented genetic evidence for the role of JAK3 in autoimmune or transplant -induced inflammatory disorders, the selective targeting of JAK3 in T cells may potentially be clinically beneficial in T cell-derived pathologic disorders. In this review we discuss inhibitors of JAK3 as a new class of immunomodulatory agents with immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-leukemic properties.

One of the greatest obstacles to gene therapy in human hematopoietic stem cells is the lack of a defined protocol in humans and low transduction efficiency. Currently, murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is the most popular choice as a gene transfer vehicle but it cannot infect non-dividing cells. In our study, vesicular stomatitis G protein pseudotyped MuLV and HIV-1 were produced by a split gene transfection method. Mononuclear cells were separated from healthy human bone marrow and pre-stimulated with cytokines to form myeloid cell lineages. The cells were infected at different MOls with highly concentrated virus and infection rates were analyzed by flow cytometry and progenitor cell assays. eGFP expression was much higher when using HIV-1 system than when using MuLV. Progenitor cell assays agreed with the results obtained by FACS, but the difference was less great. We conclude that the lentiviral system is more suitable for gene transfer to hematopoietic progenitor cells probably because it stably infects both dividing and non-dividing cells.

The TEL/RUNX1 fusion protein creates a transcriptional repressor that interferes in dominant fashion with RUNX1-dependent transactivation. Here, we demonstrate that the repressor activity of TEL/ RUNX1 differs from that of TEL, even though both TEL and TEL/RUNX1 interact with the nuclear hormone co-repressor (N-CoR) and histone deacetylase (mSin3A) in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that TEL/RUNX1 forms homodimers in vivo, and heterodimerizes with the TEL when the two proteins are expressed together. These interactions require the HLH (helix-loop-helix) region of TEL. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis showed that p300 interacts with TEL/RUNX1 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm by it. These results suggest that the p300-TEL/RUNX1 complex and heterodimerization of TEL/RUNX1 with TEL may be responsible for the ability of TEL/RUNX1 to inhibit RUNX1-mediated transactivation. It appears that loss of TEL function activates a pathway that cooperates with TEL/RUNX1 and sequesters coactivator(s) into nonfunctional complex in the cytoplasm thus inhibiting transcription of target genes.","['Lee, Young Ju', 'Kim, Jae Hyun', 'Bae, Seonghwan', 'Rho, Seung-Keun', 'Choe, Soo Young']","['Lee YJ', 'Kim JH', 'Bae S', 'Rho SK', 'Choe SY']","['Department of Biology, School of Life Sciences, Research Center for Bioresource and Health, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 361-763, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-RUNX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['702 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2004 Apr 30;17(2):217-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many of these patients ultimately relapse, implying that achievement of a clinical CR is compatible with significant amounts of residual malignant cells. Cytogenetic, molecular and immunological techniques that are more sensitive than morphology are increasingly used to assess and quantify minimal residual disease (MRD). Immunological marker analysis allows the detection of aberrant or unusual immunophenotypes, PCR techniques target fusion regions of chromosome aberrations and clone-specific immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. The rationale underlying MRD studies is to improve measurement of treatment response, to provide independent prognostic information and to optimise therapeutic strategies. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the MRD based evaluation of initial response to front-line therapy emerged as a highly relevant diagnostic tool, particularly in childhood ALL, where MRD has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor allowing a precise risk group classification. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) the prognostic significance of MRD is still a matter of debate, as the majority of patients remain MRD positive after conventional treatment. This phenomenon has changed with the implementation of new treatment modalities, such as application of monoclonal antibodies, where a significant proportion of patients with NHL converts to MRD negativity and experiences prolonged remission. Whether this molecular remission will translate into a superior overall survival is currently the goal of ongoing prospective studies.","['Bruggemann, Monika', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'Kneba, Michael']","['Bruggemann M', 'Pott C', 'Ritgen M', 'Kneba M']","['II.

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is by far the most sensitive approach to assess residual disease in this group of patients. Qualitative PCR methods give only limited information about the residual leukemic mass. Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) assays enable to monitor the kinetics of residual BCR-ABL transcripts over time in patients with a good response to imatinib. Early Q-PCR results on imatinib treatment can help to identify individuals who are likely to have a good response. In chronic phase patients after CCR, Q-PCR may identify patients who are likely to continue with their CCR or to relapse and may help to optimize treatment for this group of patients.

Although PCR for immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangement represents the gold standard for MRD detection in most cases of ALL without any fusion gene transcripts as molecular markers available, the situation in AML is more complicated because, at present, more than 50% of them lack any sort of clonality markers suitable for MRD monitoring. Thus, a number of studies have been performed in an attempt to identify cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities associated with leukemic transformation. In this paper we describe the effectiveness of the quantitative assessment of the Wilms tumor gene (WT1) transcript as a molecular marker for the detection of the leukemic clone useful for monitoring the presence of MRD in all the patients affected by acute and chronic leukemias as well as myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Cilloni, Daniela', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Cilloni D', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'WT1 Proteins/*analysis/genetics']",36,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000077562 [doi]', '77562 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2004;112(1-2):79-84. doi: 10.1159/000077562.,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

FLT3-LM are highly correlated with AML with normal karyotype and other cytogenetic aberrations of the prognostically intermediate group. This group is supposed to be a mixed group of AML with differences in the underlying pathogenesis. For more individualized treatment options it would be helpful to better characterize this large AML group not only by molecular mutations but also use these markers for the definition of minimal residual disease (MRD). However, so far the cytogenetically intermediate AML has been lacking suitable markers for PCR-based MRD detection like the fusion genes in the prognostically favourable subgroups. The suitability of the FLT3-LM as a target for PCR-based MRD was discussed controversially as it seemed to be a rather unstable marker. Thus, we aimed at the evaluation of FLT3-LM as a marker for residual disease in a large cohort of AML. Paired samples of 97 patients with AML at diagnosis and at relapse were analyzed. It could be shown that in only four cases a loss of the length mutation was detected. This is in the range of other well-characterized AML relapsing with a different geno- and/or phenotype. In contrast, a change in the ratio of the mutated allele in comparison to the wild-type allele was frequently observed. In detail, the FLT3-LM showed a tendency to accumulate during disease progression and was found more frequently at relapse than at diagnosis. In addition, 45 patients were analyzed at different time points during and after therapy. Using conventional PCR it clearly could be shown that for most of the patients positive at presentation FLT3-LM is a reliable PCR marker for monitoring treatment response. Even an early detection of relapse was possible in some cases.","['Schnittger, Susanne', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schnittger S', 'Schoch C', 'Kern W', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T']","['Laboratory for Leukaemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, University Hospital Grosshadern, Munich, Germany. susanne.schnittger@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",51,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000077561 [doi]', '77561 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2004;112(1-2):68-78. doi: 10.1159/000077561.,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

Besides improved supportive care this has mainly been achieved through the introduction of novel targeted therapies in the form of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide that specifically address the underlying molecular lesion. APL is characterized by chromosomal rearrangements of 17q21 leading to the formation of fusion proteins involving retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). To date five different fusion partners of RARA have been identified, but the vast majority of cases are characterized by the presence of the t(15;17)(q22;q12-21), which involves the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene. The identification of different breakpoint microclusters within RARA intron 2 suggests that sequence-associated or structural factors play a role in the formation of the t(15;17). In addition, the comparison of forward and reverse genomic junctions has revealed microhomologies, deletions and/or duplications of either gene consistent with the hypothesis that the t(15;17) occurs by non-homologous recombination of DNA after processing of the double strand breaks by a dysfunctional DNA damage repair mechanism. The detection of the PML-RARA fusion gene by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used for diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). In PML-RARA-positive APL about 70% of patients are expected to be cured with a combination of ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. However, relapse remains a major problem. The identification of patients at high risk of relapse and the development of risk-adapted treatment schedules are therefore clearly the most challenging tasks in the treatment of APL. Recent studies have shown that pre-emptive chemotherapy at the time of molecular relapse improves survival compared to treatment at the point of haematological relapse. Quantitative RT-PCR technology is expected to further improve the predictive value of MRD monitoring and therefore to guide therapy in order to reduce the rate of relapses and to increase rates of cure in high-risk patients.","['Reiter, Andreas', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Grimwade, David']","['Reiter A', 'Lengfelder E', 'Grimwade D']","['III.

Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of patients relapse due to persisting leukemic blasts. The persistence of these cells, below the threshold of morphological detection, is termed minimal residual disease (MRD) and various methods are used for its detection. These methods include classical cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR and multiparametric flow cytometry. Currently, less than half of the AML patients have a specific marker detectable by RT-PCR techniques. The major specific molecular markers are involvement of the MLL gene with up to 50 different partners and partial tandem duplications, the core binding factor leukemias with AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11 rearrangements, PML/RARalpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia, internal tandem duplications and mutations of FLT3 and some other rare translocations. In addition, several other genes show abnormal expression levels in AML, including the Wilms tumor gene, the PRAME gene and Ig/TCR rearrangements. Most of these genetic abnormalities can be detected by qualitative but more importantly by quantitative RT-PCR. The kinetics of disappearance of molecular markers in AML differs between the various types of leukemias, although at least a 2 log reduction of transcript after induction chemotherapy is necessary for long-term remission in all types. Conversely, the change of PCR from negativity to positivity is highly predictive of relapse. Whereas in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiparametric flow cytometry is an established method for MRD detection, this is less so in AML. The reason is the absence of well-characterized leukemia-specific antigens and the existence of phenotypic changes at relapse. On the other hand, this method is convenient due to its simplicity and universal applicability. In conclusion, several methods can be used for MRD detection in AML patients; each has its pros and cons. Several issues still remain to be settled including the choice of the best method and the timing for MRD monitoring and above all the practical clinical implications of MRD in the various types of AML.","['Raanani, P', 'Ben-Bassat, I']","['Raanani P', 'Ben-Bassat I']","['Institute of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. praanani@012.net.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods/standards', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Translocation, Genetic']",116,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000077559 [doi]', '77559 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2004;112(1-2):40-54. doi: 10.1159/000077559.,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

Thus, the risk of obtaining 'false'-negative results is increased when both quality and quantity of RNA are suboptimal. Factors which affect the sensitivity and consequently the validity of MRD results are reviewed. RNA degradation in unstabilized peripheral blood (PB) samples does not play a major role in samples being processed on the day of blood collection. However, the simulation of sample shipping at room temperature with a delay of sample processing of up to 3 days causes a dramatic loss of intact RNA. RNA degradation can be prevented by the use of a bedside RNA stabilization system. Additionally, the stabilizing procedure is capable of keeping real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) results comparable whether the sample is processed immediately or with a delay of up to 3 days. Consistent quantitative data cannot be obtained with unstabilized blood samples. Furthermore, the optimum volume of PB required for MRD diagnostics in patients with BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in complete cytogenetic remission is revisited. Ten milliliters of PB is sufficient for processing on the day of blood collection whereas the use of only 5 ml PB may result in false-negative results. Standardization of preanalytical and analytical factors is necessary to provide a comparability of RQ-PCR results from different laboratories within multicenter studies. The definition of 'undetectable BCR-ABL' in an individual patient should take these preanalytical parameters into consideration.","['Muller, Martin C', 'Hordt, Tanja', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Merx, Kirsten', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Muller MC', 'Hordt T', 'Paschka P', 'Merx K', 'La Rosee P', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

Among the methods available for monitoring MRD, flow cytometry holds great promise for clinical application because of its simplicity and wide availability. Several studies have demonstrated strong correlations between MRD levels by flow cytometry during clinical remission and treatment outcome, lending support to the reliability of this approach. Flow-cytometric detection of MRD is based on the identification of immunophenotypic combinations expressed on leukemic cells but not on normal hematopoietic cells. Its sensitivity depends on the specificity of the immunophenotypes used to track leukemic cells and on the number of cells available for study. Immunophenotypes that allow detection of 1 leukemic cell in 10,000 normal cells can be identified in at least 90% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; immunophenotypes that allow detection of 1 leukemic cell in 1,000-10,000 normal cells can be identified in at least 85% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

In mice the luminal epithelium (LE) only becomes fully receptive to the attaching blastocyst in response to the nidatory estrogen surge on d 4 of pregnancy. The cytokine leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) is rapidly induced by nidatory estrogen and has been shown to be the primary mediator of its action. Implantation fails in the absence of LIF, and injection of LIF on d 4 of pregnancy can substitute for the nidatory estrogen. In this study, we sought to identify genes regulated by LIF in the uterine epithelium. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the transcript profiles of paired uterine horns from LIF-deficient MF1 mice after intraluminal injection of LIF or PBS on d 4 of pseudopregnancy. IGF-binding protein 3 was identified as a gene up-regulated by LIF; this was confirmed by RT-PCR. In situ hybridization showed that the primary site of IGF-binding protein 3 expression is the luminal epithelium (LE), the known site of LIF action in the uterus. We identified two other genes: amphiregulin and immune response gene-1, the expression of which were also up-regulated by LIF. Immune response gene 1 has recently been shown to be essential for implantation. Expression of all three of these genes in the LE is known to be regulated by P4. The expression of osteoblast-specific factor 2 and leukocyte 12/15 lipoxygenase, which are also expressed in LE under the control of P4, were not increased by LIF. This suggests that one of the actions of LIF on LE may be to enhance the expression of a subset of P4-regulated genes.","['Sherwin, J R A', 'Freeman, T C', 'Stephens, R J', 'Kimber, S', 'Smith, A G', 'Chambers, I', 'Smith, S K', 'Sharkey, A M']","['Sherwin JR', 'Freeman TC', 'Stephens RJ', 'Kimber S', 'Smith AG', 'Chambers I', 'Smith SK', 'Sharkey AM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1QP, UK. jras100@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Amphiregulin)', '0 (Areg protein, mouse)', '0 (EGF Family of Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 4.2.1.- (Hydro-Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.1.79 (Irg1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amphiregulin', 'Animals', 'EGF Family of Proteins', 'Embryo Implantation/*genetics', 'Endometrium/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Hydro-Lyases/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/me.2004-0110 [doi]', 'me.2004-0110 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2004 Sep;18(9):2185-95. doi: 10.1210/me.2004-0110.

For CD3 and CD5, expression was dependent on the apoptotic stimulus used. It is interesting that loss of antigen expression was independent of cell size. This phenomenon was also found in nonmanipulated, highly pure CD19 B lymphocytes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Loss of LAg expression appeared to be a common feature of apoptotic lymphocytes under all the conditions assayed. The different kinetic patterns of LAg loss suggest apoptotic cells might actively regulate this process.","['Diaz, D', 'Prieto, A', 'Barcenilla, H', 'Monserrat, J', 'Prieto, P', 'Sanchez, M A', 'Reyes, E', 'Hernandez-Fuentes, M P', 'de la Hera, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Alvarez-Mon, M']","['Diaz D', 'Prieto A', 'Barcenilla H', 'Monserrat J', 'Prieto P', 'Sanchez MA', 'Reyes E', 'Hernandez-Fuentes MP', 'de la Hera A', 'Orfao A', 'Alvarez-Mon M']","['Associated Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Alcala, Carretera Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.0304171 [doi]', 'jlb.0304171 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Sep;76(3):609-15. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0304171.

Topoisomerase I-DNA complexes can be trapped by anticancer drugs (camptothecins) as well as by endogenous and exogenous DNA lesions. We show here that arsenic trioxide (a potent inducer of apoptosis that induces the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species and targets mitochondria) induces cellular topoisomerase I cleavage complexes. Bcl-2 overexpression and quenching of reactive oxygen species, which prevent arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis, also prevent the formation of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes, whereas enhancement of reactive oxygen species accumulation promotes these complexes. The caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD partially prevents arsenic trioxide-induced topoisomerase I-DNA complexes and apoptosis, suggesting that activated caspases further maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species that induce the formation of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes. Down-regulation of topoisomerase I expression decreases arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Thus, we propose that arsenic trioxide induces topoisomerase I-DNA complexes that participate in chromatin fragmentation and programmed cell death during apoptosis.","['Sordet, Olivier', 'Liao, ZhiYong', 'Liu, Hong', 'Antony, Smitha', 'Stevens, Ellen V', 'Kohlhagen, Glenda', 'Fu, Haiqing', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Sordet O', 'Liao Z', 'Liu H', 'Antony S', 'Stevens EV', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Fu H', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M404620200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77464-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 6;279(32):33968-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M404620200.

In a systematic tyrosine kinase gene exon resequencing study, 21 of 24 FLT3 exons were sequenced in samples from 53 patients with AML, 9 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 3 patients with myelodysplasia samples. Three patients had novel point mutations at residue N841 that resulted in a change to isoleucine in 2 samples and to tyrosine in 1 sample. Introduction of FLT3-N841I cDNA into Ba/F3 cells led to interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent proliferation, receptor phosphorylation, and constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK), suggesting that the N841I mutation confers constitutive activity to the receptor. An FLT3 inhibitor (PKC412) inhibited the growth of Ba/F3-FLT3N841I cells (IC(50) 10 nM), but not of wild-type Ba/F3 cells cultured with IL-3. PKC412 also reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptor and inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation. Examination of the FLT3 autoinhibited structure showed that N841 is the key residue in a hydrogen-bonding network that likely stabilizes the activation loop. These results suggest that mutations at N841 represent a significant new activating mutation in patients with AML and that patients with such mutations may respond to small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412.","['Jiang, Jingrui', 'Paez, J Guillermo', 'Lee, Jeffrey C', 'Bo, Ronghai', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Wolpin, Brian M', 'Jonasova, Anna', 'Herman, Paula', 'Fox, Edward A', 'Boggon, Titus J', 'Eck, Michael J', 'Weisberg, Ellen', 'Griffin, James D', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Sellers, William R']","['Jiang J', 'Paez JG', 'Lee JC', 'Bo R', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Galinsky I', 'Wolpin BM', 'Jonasova A', 'Herman P', 'Fox EA', 'Boggon TJ', 'Eck MJ', 'Weisberg E', 'Griffin JD', 'Gilliland DG', 'Meyerson M', 'Sellers WR']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, D720C, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-02-0712 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43434-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1855-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-02-0712.

We treated 33 patients with LL with the intensive chemotherapy regimens hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone) or modified hyper-CVAD used for ALL at our institution. Induction consolidation was administered with 8 or 9 alternating cycles of chemotherapy over 5 to 6 months with intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis, followed by maintenance therapy. Consolidative radiation therapy was given to patients with mediastinal disease at presentation. No consolidation with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed. At diagnosis, 80% were T-cell immunophenotype, 70% were stages III to IV, 70% had mediastinal involvement, and 9% had central nervous system (CNS) disease. Of the patients, 30 (91%) achieved complete remission, and 3 (9%) achieved partial response. Within a median of 13 months, 10 patients (30%) relapsed or progressed. Estimates for 3-year progression-free and overall survival for the 33 patients were 66% and 70%, respectively. Estimates for the patients with known T-cell immunophenotype were 62% and 67%, respectively. No parameters (eg, age, stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], beta(2) microglobulin) appeared to influence outcome except for CNS disease at presentation.

Here, the effect of acetaminophen on the metabolism of daunorubicin and doxorubicin by isolated enzymes lactoperoxidase and myeloperoxidase, and by myeloperoxidase-containing human leukemia HL-60 cells was investigated using spectrophotometric and EPR techniques. We report that at pharmacological concentrations acetaminophen strongly stimulates oxidation of the anthracyclines by lactoperoxidase and myeloperoxidase systems, which results in irreversibly altered (colorless) products. The initial rate and efficacy of daunorubicin oxidation depends on pH. While at pH approximately 7 the oxidation is rapid and extensive, almost no oxidation occurs at pH approximately 5. In the absence of daunorubicin, oxidation of acetaminophen by lactoperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide is only weakly dependent on pH, however, at pH 7.4 it strongly depends on [daunorubicin]. Ascorbate and reduced glutathione strongly inhibited oxidation of anthracyclines by lactoperoxidase and HL-60 systems. Using EPR, a daunorubicin-derived radical was detected in a daunorubicin/acetaminophen/peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide system as a narrow single line (0.175 mT) with g = 2.0047. When daunorubicin was omitted, only an acetaminophen-melanin EPR signal was detected (g = 2.0043, line width approximately 0.5 mT). Similar results were obtained with doxorubicin. We suggest that the stimulation by acetaminophen is primarily due to its preferential oxidation by peroxidases to the corresponding phenoxyl radical, which subsequently reacts with daunorubicin (doxorubicin). Because biological properties of oxidatively transformed anthracyclines will certainly be different from those of their parent compounds, the possible acetaminophen-enhanced degradation of the anthracyclines in vivo is likely to interfere with anticancer and/or cardiotoxic activities of these agents.","['Reszka, Krzysztof J', 'Britigan, Laura H', 'Rasmussen, George T', 'Wagner, Brett A', 'Burns, C Patrick', 'Britigan, Bradley E']","['Reszka KJ', 'Britigan LH', 'Rasmussen GT', 'Wagner BA', 'Burns CP', 'Britigan BE']","['Research Service, VA Medical Center, Iowa City, IA 52246, USA. reszka@icva.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2004/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.abb.2004.04.012 [doi]', 'S0003986104002280 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2004 Jul 1;427(1):16-29. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2004.04.012.,,,,,"['P01-CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI43954/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fusion protein, termed G-CSF-PE40, showed potent cytotoxicity in the cell line in a dose-dependent manner. G-CSF-PE40 displaced binding of biotinylated G-CSF to its receptor, and the cytotoxicity of G-CSF-PE40 was neutralized by an excess of wild-type G-CSF, indicating the receptor-mediated effects of this chimeric toxin.

Available information on long-term survival will thus often appear outdated and irrelevant. A few years ago, period-survival analysis was proposed as a means to obtain more up-to-date information on long-term cancer survival. This article assesses period and conventional cohort-based survival analyses on their ability to predict future survival. Based on historical data from the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry 5-, 10- and 15-year relative survival actually observed for patients diagnosed at one particular point in time are compared to the most recent period and cohort-based survival estimates available at that point in time. The study shows that period analysis can, in most cases, be used to provide more up-to-date long-term estimates of cancer survival. Period analysis reduces the time lag of the survival estimates by some 5-10 years for all cancers combined and especially affects the survival estimates for small intestine carcinoids, meningioma and intracranial neurinoma of the brain, non-seminoma testicular cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Talback, Mats', 'Stenbeck, Magnus', 'Rosen, Mans']","['Talback M', 'Stenbeck M', 'Rosen M']","['The Swedish Cancer Registry, Centre for Epidemiology, The National Board of Health and Welfare, SE-106 30 Stockholm, Sweden. mats.talback@sos.se']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ejca.2004.02.004 [doi]', 'S0959804904001753 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2004 Jun;40(9):1361-72. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2004.02.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with neurological symptoms due to other causes were excluded. Acute neurological symptoms developed following induction chemotherapy in 7 patients, or after a more intensive course of chemotherapy containing high-dose methotrexate (n=14). Nine patients required their chemotherapy to be altered because of the acute neurotoxicity. One patient died of cerebral haemorrhage but none of the remaining six deaths was attributed to acute neurotoxicity. We conclude that acute neurotoxicity is common in children treated with the 9002/9003 protocols and tends to be transient.

Serum MIP-1alpha levels were elevated in all 24 ATL with hypercalcemia but undetectable in all 10 patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy with solid tumors and in 34 of 37 ATL without hypercalcemia. We propose that serum MIP-1alpha is a clinical hallmark for hypercalcemia in ATL. INTRODUCTION: High serum cytokines levels are not always associated with hypercalcemia in patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), suggesting that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis of ATL patients with hypercalcemia. This study was designed to determine the role of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), a chemokine recently described as an osteoclast stimulatory factor, in ATL-associated hypercalcemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured serum interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), and MIP-1alpha levels in ATL patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. FACScan was used to measure the expression of RANKL on ATL cells. Osteoclast formation in cocultures of ATL cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was evaluated by TRACP staining. RESULTS: High serum MIP-1alpha levels were noted in all 24 ATL patients with hypercalcemia and in 3 of 37 ATL patients without hypercalcemia. The elevated levels of MIP-1alpha and calcium in ATL patients decreased after effective chemotherapy, emphasizing the role of MIP-1alpha in ATL hypercalcemia. ATL cells spontaneously produced MIP-1alpha. MIP-1alpha significantly enhanced human monocyte (precursor cells of osteoclasts) migration and induced RANKL expression on ATL cells. ATL cell-induced osteoclast formation from PBMCs was inhibited by anti-MIP-1alpha antibody and osteoprotegerin. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MIP-1alpha can induce RANKL on ATL cells in autocrine fashion and that RANKL seems to mediate the hypercalcemic effect of MIP-1alpha in ATL. We propose that MIP-1alpha is the clinical hallmark of hypercalcemia in ATL and could be a potentially useful therapeutic target.","['Okada, Yosuke', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Nakano, Kazuhisa', 'Tonai, Shinichi', 'Mine, Shinichiro', 'Tanaka, Yoshiya']","['Okada Y', 'Tsukada J', 'Nakano K', 'Tonai S', 'Mine S', 'Tanaka Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, School of Medicine, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/blood/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Cytokines/blood/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/blood/*physiology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood/metabolism', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/blood', 'RANK Ligand', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,2004/06/05 05:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/06/05 05:00'],"['2003/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/JBMR.040314 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2004 Jul;19(7):1105-11. doi: 10.1359/JBMR.040314.

Molecular epidemiological analysis was performed on the genes responsible for the X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) phenotype of the majority of Italian patients and their distinct mutations were characterized. Mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a member of Tec Family of protein tyrosine kinases, have been found to be mainly responsible for XLA disease. The exact function of BTK in signal transduction is not yet known; thus, the specific role of BTK in receptor-dependent calcium signaling and the pro-antiapoptotic regulatory activity was addressed by transfecting RAMOS-1, a BTK-deficient human Burkitt's/B cell leukemia line with wild-type and mutant constructs. This work may provide clues about critical sites in the molecule and give support for gene therapy as a potential successful approach to XLA. Another aspect of this research is the identification and dissection of the molecular events that are likely to be directly related to the ability to express various isotypes of immunoglobulin with differing function and certain B cell immunodeficiency, mainly common variable disease and non-X-linked hyperIgM. B cell development and maturation steps in different compartments of the immune system are tracked by the analysis of cell-surface molecules and components of the signal transduction pathways, i.e. CD40, CD30, CD27, CD38, CD22 and CD24.

Therefore the purpose of our study was to examine the changes in concentrations of IL-6 and IL-12 in blood plasma, culture supernatant and isolated and broken lymphocytes from patients with B-CLL. The study was performed in I (n = 12) and III (n = 12) stage of disease according to Rai's classification--20 males and 4 females (aged 45-65) and in 12 healthy volunteers blood donors 35-55 years old. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. The measurement of concentrations of IL-6 was performed using the IL-6 immunoenzyme set of ELISA, R&D Systems Europe (UK) in plasma, culture supernatant and broken leukaemic cells. The results showed a significant increase in IL-6 and IL-12 concentration in blood plasma, culture supernatant and inside of the lymphocytes at I and III stage of B-CLL with regard to control groups. An increase of IL-6 and IL-12 concentrations in blood plasma and culture supernatant may suggest higher secretions by lymphocytes these interleukins during the course of B-CLL.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome can be fatal, particularly in patients with endomyocardial fibrosis, and treatment has traditionally been palliative or preventive. The disease shares features with myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, including responsiveness to hydroxyurea and interferon. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, a highly effective treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, has shown efficacy in normalizing eosinophil counts and resolving signs and symptoms in some HES patients. Fusion of the Fip1-like 1 gene (FIP1L1) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (PDGFRA) was discovered in the majority of patients with imatinib-sensitive HES, and all patients with the fusion responded to imatinib. The product of this fusion gene, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, is a constitutively active protein-tyrosine kinase capable of transforming hematopoietic cells. The efficacy of relatively low imatinib concentrations in HES, mediated by inhibition of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha kinase activity, causally implicates FIP1L1-PDGFRA in the pathogenesis in certain HES patients.","['Stone, Richard M', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Klion, Amy D']","['Stone RM', 'Gilliland DG', 'Klion AD']","['Adult Leukemia Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",36,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0093775404001514 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2004.03.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2004 Apr;31(2 Suppl 6):12-7. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2004.03.035.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A murine monoclonal antibody against CD25 was assessed in addition to standard GVHD prophylaxis for reducing GVHD in children with advanced leukemia after MUD BMT (group I). We compared the incidence of GVHD, relapse and survival under prophylaxis with either anti-CD25 (group I, n = 10) or MSD BMT without anti-CD25 (group II, n = 10) with respect to known risk factors of transplant related morbidity, mortality and outcome. 3/10 leukemia patients in both groups were in CR3 or in relapse at time of transplant. Whereas incidence of acute GVHD grade III and IV was significantly higher in group I compared to group II (0.4 vs. 0.0), no differences in engraftment, or chronic GVHD were seen between both groups. In addition, overall (0.5 vs. 0.6) and leukemia free survival (0.5 vs. 0.6) was not different after 8 respectively 10 years from transplant. Murine anti-CD25 therapy may have contributed to matching outcome of MUD vs. MSD marrow transplants in children with advanced leukemia. In conclusion, the use of anti-CD25 in modulation of CD25+ regulatory and effector T cells in allo- and leukemia recognition merrits further exploration of its potential to improve both tolerance and leukemia control. Since the outcome of children with leukemia that received intensified GVHD prophylaxis in MUD BMT was similar to children with MSD transplants, MUD BMT has to be considered as an equivalent therapeutic option for patients, who have no HLA-identical sibling donor.","['Wawer, A', 'Laws, H-J', 'Dilloo, D', 'Gobel, U', 'Burdach, S']","['Wawer A', 'Laws HJ', 'Dilloo D', 'Gobel U', 'Burdach S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany. angela.wawer@lrz.tum.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'GO90DFK14U (inolimomab)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging/methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Survivors']",,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-822630 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2004 May-Jun;216(3):169-75. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-822630.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it was not examined whether WT1 peptide vaccination had the potency to reject tumor cells in a ""therapeutic"" setting. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that WT1 peptide vaccination combined with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell wall skeleton (BCG-CWS) was more effective for eradication of WT1-expressing tumor cells that had been implanted into mice before vaccination (a ""therapeutic"" model) compared with WT1 peptide vaccination alone. An intradermal injection of BCG-CWS into mice, followed by that of WT1 peptide at the same site on the next day, generated WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and led to rejection of WT1-expressing leukemia or lung cancer cells.

Blood group data were recorded from the case records of all the patients in a tertiary care centre with the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, during the period 1987-1997. There were 63 Hodgkin's lymphoma, 78 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 116 acute myeloid leukaemia and 522 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients. We assessed the distribution of ABO blood groups and the difference in the distribution from the source population. In Hodgkin's lymphoma, there were 45.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.8-84.5] more patients with B blood group. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, there were 14.3% (95% CI: 3.2-25.2) more patients with O blood group. In Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, there were 56.5% (95% CI: 19.9-85.4) and 52.9% (95% CI: 18.1-82.6) less patients with A blood group, respectively.

The basis for early loss of teeth appears to be a reduction of the root surface area after radiation exposure. These effects in the periodontium are a consequence of combined radiochemotherapy usually applied for treatment of childhood neoplasia. Chemotherapy alone also results in changes of periodontal development. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old patient is reported, who, at the age of 11 years, received high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy of neuroaxis and cranium for acute lymphatic leukemia with relapse. The patient consulted the Implant Section of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery because of severe dental changes and tooth loss despite adequate dental care and oral hygiene. Radiation doses given to the superior maxilla and mandible at the age of 11 were estimated to be in the range of 8-25 Gy. CONCLUSION: Intense, life-long dental care and follow-up of patients cured from malignant disease in childhood must hence be postulated in order to minimize dental treatment sequelae by supportive measures, but also to initiate timely adequate dental and prosthetic management.","['Herrmann, Thomas', 'Dorr, Wolfgang', 'Koy, Susanne', 'Lesche, Aquina', 'Lehmann, Dietmar']","['Herrmann T', 'Dorr W', 'Koy S', 'Lesche A', 'Lehmann D']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie und Radioonkologie, Medizinische Fakultat der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden. thomas.herrmann@mailbox.tu-dresden.de']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

The microenvironment likely plays a prominent role because the malignant cells progressively accumulate in vivo, whereas they rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis when cultured in vitro. To assess microenvironment-mediated survival signals, B-CLL cells were cultured with a murine fibroblast cell line, Ltk-, with and without an agonistic antibody to CD40. Spontaneous apoptosis was associated with the loss of Akt and NF-kappaB activities. Interactions with fibroblasts sustained a basal level of Akt and NF-kappaB activities, which was dependent on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Constitutive activity of the PI3K pathway in B-CLL cells when cultured with fibroblasts prevented the downregulation of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL and the caspase inhibitor proteins FLIPL and XIAP, and consequently caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. CD40 crosslinking in B-CLL cells did not further prevent murine fibroblasts-mediated apoptosis but induced cell proliferation, which was associated with an increase of Akt and NF-kappaB activation compared with cells cultured with fibroblasts alone. The PI3K pathway seems to play a pivotal role in B-CLL cell survival and growth.","['Cuni, S', 'Perez-Aciego, P', 'Perez-Chacon, G', 'Vargas, J A', 'Sanchez, A', 'Martin-Saavedra, F M', 'Ballester, S', 'Garcia-Marco, J', 'Jorda, J', 'Durantez, A']","['Cuni S', 'Perez-Aciego P', 'Perez-Chacon G', 'Vargas JA', 'Sanchez A', 'Martin-Saavedra FM', 'Ballester S', 'Garcia-Marco J', 'Jorda J', 'Durantez A']","['Fundacion LAIR, Madrid, Spain. paloma_perez@cilsp.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Signal Transduction']",,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/09/10 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403398 [doi]', '2403398 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Aug;18(8):1391-400. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403398.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NI cause considerable morbidity and mortality and are associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased health care costs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the incidence of NI in pediatric patients with neoplastic disease as a first step toward improving infection control policies. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study from March through May 2001 was performed in the pediatric hematology/oncology unit at the University Hospital in Barcelona. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were used as standard definition for NI. NI rates were calculated as a density incidence rate (per 100 patient-days). RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were admitted during the study period. Twelve patients had a total of 18 NI. The incidence of NI was 1.77 per 100 patient-days. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the highest NI rate (2.71 per 100 patient-days). The most frequent episodes of NI were bacteremia (55.5%) and fever of unknown origin (16.6%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were gram-positive bacteria (78.6%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococci were the most common isolates in bacteremias (70%). The extrinsic risk factors related with the highest incidence rates of NI per 100 patient-days were central venous catheterization (1.7 infections) and parenteral nutrition (3.2 infections). CONCLUSIONS: Extrinsic risk factors associated with NI have been identified in this high-risk population. These findings suggest the need to evaluate the infection control measures to reduce the morbidity and mortality in a hematology/oncology unit.,"['Urrea, Mireya', 'Rives, Susana', 'Cruz, Ofelia', 'Navarro, Albert', 'Garcia, Juan Jose', 'Estella, Jesus']","['Urrea M', 'Rives S', 'Cruz O', 'Navarro A', 'Garcia JJ', 'Estella J']","['Quality Service-Infection Hospital Program, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Infect Control,American journal of infection control,8004854,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infection Control', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Male', 'Pediatrics', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Distribution', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ajic.2003.10.013 [doi]', 'S019665530300823X [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Infect Control. 2004 Jun;32(4):205-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ajic.2003.10.013.,,,,,,,,['Am J Infect Control. 2005 Dec;33(10):611.

K562-R and LAMA-R cells that were markedly resistant to induction of mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation, cytochrome c, and apoptosis-inducing factor release) and apoptosis by imatinib mesylate exhibited a pronounced reduction in expression of Bcr/Abl, Bcl-x(L), and STAT5 but a striking increase in levels of activated Lyn. Whereas basal expression of Bcl-2 protein was very low in parental cells, imatinib-resistant cells displayed a marked increase in Bcl-2 mRNA and/or protein levels. Treatment of LAMA-R cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced Lyn activation as well as Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels. Transient or stable transfection of LAMA84 or K562 cells with a constitutively active Lyn (Y508F), but not with a kinase-dead mutant (K275D), significantly increased Bcl-2 protein expression and protected cells from lethality of imatinib mesylate. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 protected K562 and LAMA84 cells from imatinib mesylate- and PP2-mediated lethality. Conversely, interference with Bcl-2 function by co-administration of the small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor HA14-1 or down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression by small interfering RNA or antisense strategies significantly increased mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis induced by imatinib mesylate and the topoisomerase inhibitor VP-16 in LAMA-R cells. In marked contrast, these interventions had little effect in parental LAMA84 cells that display low basal levels of Bcl-2.

All three of these transcriptional regulatory proteins accumulate with robust circadian rhythms in tissues with high amplitudes of clock gene expression, such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the liver. However, they are expressed at nearly invariable levels in most brain regions, in which clock gene expression only cycles with low amplitude. Here we show that mice deficient for all three PAR bZip proteins are highly susceptible to generalized spontaneous and audiogenic epilepsies that frequently are lethal. Transcriptome profiling revealed pyridoxal kinase (Pdxk) as a target gene of PAR bZip proteins in both liver and brain. Pyridoxal kinase converts vitamin B6 derivatives into pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the coenzyme of many enzymes involved in amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism. PAR bZip-deficient mice show decreased brain levels of PLP, serotonin, and dopamine, and such changes have previously been reported to cause epilepsies in other systems. Hence, the expression of some clock-controlled genes, such as Pdxk, may have to remain within narrow limits in the brain. This could explain why the circadian oscillator has evolved to generate only low-amplitude cycles in most brain regions.","['Gachon, Frederic', 'Fonjallaz, Philippe', 'Damiola, Francesca', 'Gos, Pascal', 'Kodama, Tohru', 'Zakany, Jozsef', 'Duboule, Denis', 'Petit, Brice', 'Tafti, Mehdi', 'Schibler, Ueli']","['Gachon F', 'Fonjallaz P', 'Damiola F', 'Gos P', 'Kodama T', 'Zakany J', 'Duboule D', 'Petit B', 'Tafti M', 'Schibler U']","['Department of Molecular Biology, National Center of Competence Research Frontiers in Genetics, Sciences III, University of Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DBP protein, rat)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dbp protein, mouse)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (Prelp protein, mouse)', '0 (Prelp protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEF protein, human)', '0 (Tef protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.35 (Pyridoxal Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Brain/metabolism', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Epilepsy/*etiology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/analysis/*deficiency/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*deficiency/*physiology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism', 'Pyridoxal Kinase/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/physiology']",,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1101/gad.301404 [doi]', '301404 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2004 Jun 15;18(12):1397-412. doi: 10.1101/gad.301404.

These haematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) share a number of properties, including redundancy, pleiotropy, autocrine and paracrine effects, receptor subunit oligomerisation and similar signal transduction mechanisms, yet each one has a unique spectrum of haematopoietic activity. Ongoing studies with knockout mice have discovered previously unrecognised physiological roles for HGFs, linking haematopoiesis to innate immunity, pulmonary physiology and bone metabolism. The regulation of stem cells by HGFs within niches of the bone marrow microenvironment is now well recognised and similar mechanisms appear to exist in the regulation of other stem cell compartments. Alternative signalling strategies, other than tyrosine kinase activation and phosphotyrosine cascades, may account for some of the more subtle differences between HGFs. Accumulating evidence suggests that some, but not all, HGF receptors can transduce a genuine lineage-determining signal at certain points in haematopoiesis. Further studies, primarily at the receptor level, are needed to determine the mechanisms of instructive signalling, which may include phosphoserine cascades. Novel haematopoietic regulators, as well as the development of biological therapies, including growth factor antagonists and peptide mimetics, are also discussed.","['Thomas, Daniel', 'Vadas, Mathew', 'Lopez, Angel']","['Thomas D', 'Vadas M', 'Lopez A']","['The Hanson Institute, Division of Human Immunology, The Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung Diseases/therapy', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism']",91,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['EBT040611 [pii]', '10.1517/14712598.4.6.869 [doi]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2004 Jun;4(6):869-79. doi: 10.1517/14712598.4.6.869.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the monitoring of minimal residual disease and early detection of imminent relapse has also become an important issue. Novel transplant procedures, for example dose-reduced conditioning protocols, rely on chimerism analysis to guide intervention, i.e. the reduction of immunosuppression or infusion of donor lymphocytes. During the last 30 years, several methods for the analysis of chimerism after hematopoietic cell transplantation have been published. Currently, fluorescent in situ hybridization (XY-FISH) analysis of sex chromosomes after transplantation from a sex-mismatched donor or analysis of polymorphic DNA sequences, i.e. short tandem repeats (STR) or variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), are the most widely used procedures used in the assessment of chimerism. Two major diagnostic fields can be defined for chimerism analysis: the period of engraftment and the detection of minimal residual disease. Although STR-PCR and FISH analysis are very useful in the diagnosis of engraftment and graft failure, they are only of limited use in the monitoring of minimal residual disease, largely because of its limited level of sensitivity (1-5% for the minor population). Several novel procedures to improve this level of detection have been reported in recent years. One focus has been the use of real-time PCR techniques based on analysis of the Y-chromosome or, more recently, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). These procedures combine quantitative analysis with high sensitivity (10(-4) to 10(-6)), and hold great potential for the future. In addition, the combination of cell sorting based on leukemia-specific immunophenotype and STR-PCR has been successfully used for minimal residual disease detection. First clinical data using these procedures indicate that intervention (e.g. the reduction of immunosuppression or donor lymphocyte infusion) may be effective in the minimal residual disease situation, even in high risk diseases like acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The optimal timing of these diagnostic interventions is a critical issue and has to be further optimized. Whether this will ultimately improve the survival of patients with leukemia after transplantation has to be shown in prospective studies.","['Thiede, Christian']",['Thiede C'],"['Medical Department, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Am J Pharmacogenomics,American journal of pharmacogenomics : genomics-related research in drug development and clinical practice,100967746,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Treatment Failure']",92,2004/06/04 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/06/04 05:00'],"['2004/06/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['435 [pii]', '10.2165/00129785-200404030-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pharmacogenomics. 2004;4(3):177-87. doi: 10.2165/00129785-200404030-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: HRCT (computer tomograph of the third generation ""Somatom CR-3"") was made in fever, changes in physical examination in patients (n = 28) after BMT from November 2001 to January 2003. BMT was made in myelomic disease, lymphogranulomatosis, acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, lymphosarcoma, autoimmune hemolytic anemia. RESULTS: Twenty four patients were examined before BMT. Of them, 18 patients had roentgenomorphological changes of the parenchyma, primarily, diffuse. Three patients were examined during conditioning, two cases had signs of toxic pulmonitis. One day after allo-BMT all the patients exhibited lowering of densitometric values of pulmonary tissue by 70 HU vs the baseline. Infectious affection of the lungs was diagnosed in 13 cases during day 0-100. From day 100 after allo-BMT 7 recipients were observed. In 6 cases the changes resulted from transplant against host reaction. Infectious affection of pulmonary tissue was observed in 1 case. Characteristic x-ray picture of pulmonary stroma in secondary disease was determined. CONCLUSION: For early diagnosis of pneumonia in myelotoxic agranulocytosis it is necessary to make examination by HRCT before BMT. HRCT of the chest is indicated in even minor changes in the clinical picture. It is necessary to perform a control over water-electrolyte balance and active respiratory exercise in the course of conditioning. Viral pneumonias show the picture of metainflammatory changes for a long time. Fungal pneumonias tend to recurrence at ""previous site"".

Following exclusion of overt acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially the megakaryoblastic subtype, a retrospective study was performed on 46 patients with clinical and morphological features suggesting the diagnosis of APMF. All patients had a bone marrow (BM) biopsy performed at onset, and 13 had follow-up examinations. Enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were applied and BM features evaluated by a semiquantitative scoring system. Clinical findings consisted of pancytopenia associated with a left-shifted differential count of the peripheral blood (less than 5% blasts) and no or minor splenomegaly. During follow-up (median survival 9 months) 35 patients developed severe BM insufficiency and 10 transformed into overt AML. Although myelofibrosis was a characteristic finding, other BM features proved to be heterogeneous. Cellularity was reduced in 13 and increased in 25 specimens. Most prominent was a left-shifted, often macrocytic erythropoiesis and a maturation defect of the neutrophil series. In 15 patients an increase (less than 20%) in CD34+ progenitors, immature myelomonocytic cells, and megakaryoblasts was noted. Abnormalities of megakaryocytes (atypical microforms, clustering, dysplasia) were regularly present. The stroma showed an inflammatory reaction (perivascular plasmacytosis, lymphoid nodules, many macrophages, iron deposits) in about 50% of the samples. Sequential BM biopsies revealed an accumulation of lysozyme-expressing myelomonocytic and CD34+ progenitor cells suggesting an increase in blasts. In conclusion, APMF may not be a distinct entity, but includes hyperfibrotic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) either primary or secondary, a rare form of initial AML with fibrosis, and even cases of toxic myelopathy.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Zerhusen, G', 'Vardiman, J', 'Diehl, V', 'Luebbert, M', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Zerhusen G', 'Vardiman J', 'Diehl V', 'Luebbert M', 'Schmitt-Graeff A']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmannstr. 9, Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/etiology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*classification/complications/etiology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/09/15 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0881-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Aug;83(8):513-21. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0881-8.

It is currently in early phase clinical trials. The exact mechanism of action of this anticancer agent still needs to be clarified. We have previously reported that aplidine blocks the secretion of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the human leukaemia cells MOLT-4, suggesting a possible effect on tumour angiogenesis. This study was designed to investigate the antiangiogenic effect of aplidine. In vivo, in the chick embryo allantoic membrane (CAM) assay, aplidine inhibited spontaneous angiogenesis, angiogenesis elicited by exogenous VEGF and FGF-2, and induced by VEGF overexpressing 1A9 ovarian carcinoma cells. In vitro, at concentrations achievable in the plasma of patients, aplidine inhibited endothelial cell functions related to angiogenesis. It affected VEGF- and FGF-2-induced endothelial cell proliferation, inhibited cell migration and invasiveness assessed in the Boyden chamber and blocked the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by endothelial cells. Finally, aplidine prevented the formation of capillary-like structures by endothelial cells on Matrigel. These findings indicate that aplidine has antiangiogenic activity in vivo and inhibits endothelial cell functional responses to angiogenic stimuli in vitro. This effect might contribute to the antineoplastic activity of aplidine.","['Taraboletti, G', 'Poli, M', 'Dossi, R', 'Manenti, L', 'Borsotti, P', 'Faircloth, G T', 'Broggini, M', ""D'Incalci, M"", 'Ribatti, D', 'Giavazzi, R']","['Taraboletti G', 'Poli M', 'Dossi R', 'Manenti L', 'Borsotti P', 'Faircloth GT', 'Broggini M', ""D'Incalci M"", 'Ribatti D', 'Giavazzi R']","['Department of Oncology, Mario Negri Institute, Bergamo 24125, Italy. taraboletti@marionegri.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Capillaries', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chick Embryo', '*Depsipeptides', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/analysis', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6601864 [doi]', '6601864 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2004 Jun 14;90(12):2418-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601864.,,,,,,,,,PMC2409535,,,,,,,,,

We have previously found that myeloma and leukemic cells in transition from low-density log phase conditions to high-density plateau phase conditions export substantial amounts of endogenous topoisomerase II alpha from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In order for topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy to function, the topoisomerase target must have access to the nuclear DNA. Therefore, the nuclear export of topoisomerase II alpha may contribute to drug resistance, and defining this mechanism may lead to methods to preclude this avenue of resistance. We have identified nuclear export signals for topoisomerase II alpha at amino acids 1017-1028 and 1054-1066, using FITC-labeled BSA-export signal peptide conjugates microinjected into the nuclei of HeLa cells. Functional confirmation of both signals (1017-1028 and 1054-1066) was provided by transfection of human myeloma cells with plasmids containing the gene for a full-length human FLAG-topoisomerase fusion protein, mutated at hydrophobic amino acid residues in the export signals. Of the six putative export signals tested, the two sites above were found to induce export into the cytoplasm. Export by both signals was blocked by treatment of the cells with leptomycin B, indicating that a CRM-1-dependent pathway mediates export. Site-directed mutagenesis of two central hydrophobic residues in either export signal in full-length human topoisomerase blocked export of recombinant FLAG-topoisomerase II alpha, indicating that both signals may be required for export. Interestingly, this pair of nuclear export signals (1017-1028 and 1054-1066) also defines a dimerization domain of the topoisomerase II alpha molecule.","['Turner, Joel G', 'Engel, Roxanne', 'Derderian, Jennifer A', 'Jove, Richard', 'Sullivan, Daniel M']","['Turner JG', 'Engel R', 'Derderian JA', 'Jove R', 'Sullivan DM']","['Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

It is also well known that ERKs phosphorylate a wide array of substrates distributed throughout distinct cellular locations such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell periphery, but the relative contribution of these compartmentalized signal components to the overall survival signal generated by activation of ERKs has yet to be established. To this end, we have utilized constitutively activated forms of ERK2, whose expression is restricted to the nucleus or to the cytoplasm, to investigate the consequences of compartmentalized activation of ERK in the survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells subjected to distinct apoptogenic stimuli. We show that cytoplasmic ERK2 activity protected against apoptosis caused by prolonged serum starvation, whereas ERK2 activation restricted to the nucleus antagonized apoptosis induced by the Bcr-Abl inhibitor STI571. On the other hand, neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear ERK2 activities were effective in counteracting apoptosis induced by UV light. These results demonstrate that the protective effects of ERK2 against defined apoptogenic stimuli are strictly dependent on the cellular localization where ERK activation takes place. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that the complex I kappa B-NF kappa B participates on ERK2-mediated survival mechanisms, in a fashion dependent on the cellular location where ERK2 is active and on the causative apoptogenic stimulus.","['Ajenjo, Nuria', 'Canon, Estela', 'Sanchez-Perez, Isabel', 'Matallanas, David', 'Leon, Javier', 'Perona, Rosario', 'Crespo, Piero']","['Ajenjo N', 'Canon E', 'Sanchez-Perez I', 'Matallanas D', 'Leon J', 'Perona R', 'Crespo P']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Unidad de Biomedicina de la Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC, Santander 39011, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/09/11 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M313656200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77582-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jul 30;279(31):32813-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M313656200.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MM cells were exposed to bortezomib for 6 h before the addition of HDAC inhibitors (total, 26 h), after which reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, signaling and cell cycle pathways, and apoptosis were monitored. The functional role of ROS generation was assessed using the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine. RESULTS: Preincubation with a subtoxic concentration of bortezomib markedly sensitized U266 and MM.1S cells to sodium butyrate- and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction; caspase 9, 8, and 3 activation; and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation; resulting in synergistic apoptosis induction. These events were associated with nuclear factor kappaB inactivation, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation, p53 induction, and caspase-dependent cleavage of p21(CIP1), p27(KIP1), and Bcl-2, as well as Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and cyclin D1 down-regulation. The bortezomib/HDAC inhibitor regimen markedly induced ROS generation; moreover, apoptosis and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation were attenuated by N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Dexamethasone- or doxorubicin-resistant MM cells failed to exhibit cross-resistance to the bortezomib/HDAC inhibitor regimen, nor did exogenous interleukin 6 or insulin-like growth factor I block apoptosis induced by this drug combination. Finally, bortezomib/HDAC inhibitors induced pronounced lethality in primary CD138(+) bone marrow cells from MM patients, but not in the CD138(-) cell population. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential exposure to bortezomib in conjunction with clinically relevant HDAC inhibitors potently induces mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in human MM cells through a ROS-dependent mechanism, suggesting that a strategy combining these agents warrants further investigation in MM.","['Pei, Xin-Yan', 'Dai, Yun', 'Grant, Steven']","['Pei XY', 'Dai Y', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine,Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Syndecans)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7G33012534 (Sodium Oxybate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sodium Oxybate/pharmacology', 'Syndecan-1', 'Syndecans', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Vorinostat', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0561 [doi]', '10/11/3839 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 1;10(11):3839-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0561.,,,,,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on the expression and prognostic impact of these molecules in childhood AML are rare. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, we, therefore, investigated 45 leukemic cell samples from children with de novo AML enrolled and treated within the German AML-BFM93 study for the expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins [CD95, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL, procaspase-3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1), survivin]. RESULTS: XIAP (P < 0.002) but no other apoptosis regulators showed maturation-dependent expression differences as determined by French-American-British (FAB) morphology with the highest expression levels observed within the immature M0/1 subtypes. XIAP (P < 0.01) and Bcl-xL (P < 0.01) expression was lower in patients with favorable rather than intermediate/poor cytogenetics. After a mean follow-up of 34 months, a shorter overall survival was associated with high expression levels of XIAP [30 (n = 10) versus 41 months (n = 34); P < 0.05] and survivin [27 (n = 10) versus 41 months (n = 34); P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that apoptosis-related molecules are associated with maturation stage, cytogenetic risk groups, and therapy outcome in childhood de novo AML. The observed association of XIAP with immature FAB types, intermediate/poor cytogenetics, and poor overall survival should be confirmed within prospective pediatric AML trials.","['Tamm, Ingo', 'Richter, Stephan', 'Oltersdorf, Doreen', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Scholz, Frank', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Wuchter, Christian']","['Tamm I', 'Richter S', 'Oltersdorf D', 'Creutzig U', 'Harbott J', 'Scholz F', 'Karawajew L', 'Ludwig WD', 'Wuchter C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. ingo.tamm@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Risk', 'Survivin', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0642 [doi]', '10/11/3737 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 1;10(11):3737-44. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0642.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a Phase II clinical trial of bevacizumab administered after chemotherapy to adults with refractory or relapsed AML, using a timed sequential therapy (TST) approach. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was administered on day 8 after 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 2 g/m(2)/72 h beginning day 1 and mitoxantrone 40 mg/m(2) beginning day 4. In vivo laboratory correlates included AML cell VEGF receptor-1 (FLT-1) expression, marrow microvessel density, and free serum VEGF before and during TST with bevacizumab. RESULTS: Forty-eight adults received induction therapy. Myelosuppression occurred in all of the patients similar to other TST regimens. Toxicities were decreased ejection fraction (6%), cerebrovascular bleed (4%), and mortality of 15%. Overall response was 23 of 48 (48%), with complete response (CR) in 16 (33%). Eighteen (14 CR and 4 partial response) underwent one consolidation cycle and 5 (3 CR and 2 partial response) underwent allogeneic transplant. Median overall and disease-free survivals for CR patients were 16.2 months (64%, 1 year) and 7 months (35%, 1 year). Marrow blasts demonstrated FLT-1 staining before bevacizumab and marked decrease in microvessel density after bevacizumab. VEGF was detected in pretreatment serum in 67% of patients tested, increased by day 8 in 52%, and decreased in 93% (67% undetectable) 2 h after bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In this single arm study, cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by bevacizumab yields a favorable CR rate and duration in adults with AML that is resistant to traditional treatment approaches. The clearance of marrow blasts in some patients after bevacizumab suggests that VEGF neutralization might result directly in leukemic cell death. The potential biological and clinical activity of bevacizumab in AML warrants additional clinical and laboratory study.","['Karp, Judith E', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Pili, Roberto', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Greer, Jacqueline', 'Guo, Chuanfa', 'Qian, David', 'Morris, Lawrence', 'Tidwell, Michael', 'Chen, Helen', 'Zwiebel, James']","['Karp JE', 'Gojo I', 'Pili R', 'Gocke CD', 'Greer J', 'Guo C', 'Qian D', 'Morris L', 'Tidwell M', 'Chen H', 'Zwiebel J']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. jkarp2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bevacizumab', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/metabolism']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/12/28 09:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0627 [doi]', '10/11/3577 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 1;10(11):3577-85. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0627.,,,,,"['CA69854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To follow the fate of ex vivo generated anti-AML-reactive CTLs, splenocytes obtained from enhanced green fluorescent protein transgenic mice were cocultured with AML lysate-pulsed dendritic cells, which subsequently were expanded by exposure to anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody-coated magnetic microspheres. To track AML cells, stable transfectants of C1498 expressing DsRed2, a red fluorescent protein, were generated. Three factors related to CTLs correlated with disease-free survival: (a). CTL L-selectin expression. L-Selectin high fractions resulted in 70% disease-free survival, whereas L-selectin low-expressing CTLs resulted in only 30% disease-free survival. (b). Duration of ex vivo expansion (9 versus 16 days). Short-term expanded CTLs could be found at high frequency in lymphoid organs for longer than 4 weeks after transfer, whereas long-term expanded CTLs were cleared from the system after 2 weeks. Duration of expansion correlated inversely with L-selectin expression. (c). CTL dose. A higher dose (40 versus 5 x 10(6)) resulted in superior disease-free survival. This survival advantage was achieved with short-term expanded CTLs only. The site of treatment failure was mainly the central nervous system where no CTLs could be identified at AML sites.","['Sauer, Martin G', 'Ericson, Marna E', 'Weigel, Brenda J', 'Herron, Michael J', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Kren, Betsy T', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'Serody, Jon S', 'June, Carl H', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Sauer MG', 'Ericson ME', 'Weigel BJ', 'Herron MJ', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Kren BT', 'Levine BL', 'Serody JS', 'June CH', 'Taylor PA', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'L-Selectin/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3991 [doi]', '64/11/3914 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 1;64(11):3914-21. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3991.,,,,,"['AI 34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 49997/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 5952/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt is a common perturbation observed in malignant cells. Surprisingly, although Akt activity is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis in nontransformed hematopoietic precursors and maintenance of Akt activity was required for rapid disease progression, the expression of activated Akt did not increase the proliferation of the premalignant or malignant cells in culture. However, Akt stimulated glucose consumption in transformed cells without affecting the rate of oxidative phosphorylation. High rates of aerobic glycolysis were also identified in human glioblastoma cells possessing but not those lacking constitutive Akt activity. Akt-expressing cells were more susceptible than control cells to death after glucose withdrawal. These data suggest that activation of the Akt oncogene is sufficient to stimulate the switch to aerobic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells and that Akt activity renders cancer cells dependent on aerobic glycolysis for continued growth and survival.","['Elstrom, Rebecca L', 'Bauer, Daniel E', 'Buzzai, Monica', 'Karnauskas, Robyn', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Plas, David R', 'Zhuang, Hongming', 'Cinalli, Ryan M', 'Alavi, Abass', 'Rudin, Charles M', 'Thompson, Craig B']","['Elstrom RL', 'Bauer DE', 'Buzzai M', 'Karnauskas R', 'Harris MH', 'Plas DR', 'Zhuang H', 'Cinalli RM', 'Alavi A', 'Rudin CM', 'Thompson CB']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glioblastoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Transfection']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2904 [doi]', '64/11/3892 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 1;64(11):3892-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2904.,,,,,"['K08HL070827/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24-CA83105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Cancer Res. 2021 Oct 1;81(19):4896-4898.

Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions is a frequent method of silencing tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in cancers and may be induced by oncogenic viruses. We investigated the relationship between the presence of SV40 or EBV DNA sequences and the methylation profiles for 10 TSGs in 90 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas/leukemias and 56 control tissues. SV40 sequences were present in 33/90 (37%) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas/leukemias, and EBV was present in 11/42 (26%) of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. We found a highly significant correlation between the presence of SV40 and methylation of seven genes (P values, 0.006 to <0.0001). In lymphomas, there was no relationship between EBV and methylation. Oncogenic viruses and methylation were rarely present in control tissues. We investigated methylation of the same 10 TSGs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a healthy volunteer infected with EBV or EBV and SV40. Promoter methylation of CDH1 and CDH13 were noted in dual SV40- and EBV-infected PBMC, and these two genes were also highly significantly correlated to the presence of SV40 sequences in tumors. SV40 infection also resulted in appearance of the lymphoma/leukemia-specific marker, methylated SHP1. Methylation was completely absent in uninfected and EBV-infected PBMC. Our results demonstrate that the presence of SV40 in hematological malignancies is associated with promoter methylation of TSGs and that in all probability, the virus plays a role in tumor pathogenesis.","['Shivapurkar, Narayan', 'Takahashi, Takao', 'Reddy, Jyotsna', 'Zheng, Yingye', 'Stastny, Victor', 'Collins, Robert', 'Toyooka, Shinichi', 'Suzuki, Makato', 'Parikh, Gunjan', 'Asplund, Sheryl', 'Kroft, Steven H', 'Timmons, Charles', 'McKenna, Robert W', 'Feng, Ziding', 'Gazdar, Adi F']","['Shivapurkar N', 'Takahashi T', 'Reddy J', 'Zheng Y', 'Stastny V', 'Collins R', 'Toyooka S', 'Suzuki M', 'Parikh G', 'Asplund S', 'Kroft SH', 'Timmons C', 'McKenna RW', 'Feng Z', 'Gazdar AF']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-8593, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*genetics/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3307 [doi]', '64/11/3757 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Jun 1;64(11):3757-60. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3307.,,,,,['5U01CA8497102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects included 248 CML survivors who received an HC transplant (related donors [RDs], n = 150; unrelated donors [URDs], n = 70; or autologous, n = 28) and had survived at least 2 years, and a comparison group of 317 siblings. Subjects completed a 238-item survey on medical late effects. Compared with siblings, survivors were at a higher risk of developing ocular, oral health, endocrine, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurosensory, and neuromotor impairments. Multivariate analysis limited to RD and URD recipients found that chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was associated with a higher risk of hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, cardiopulmonary, neurosensory, and neuromotor impairments. Overall health was reported as excellent, very good, or good in 78% of subjects, although those with cGVHD were more likely to report poor overall health. URD survivors were more likely to report a need for assistance with routine activities and that their current health prevented work or school attendance. This study demonstrates that HCT survivors, regardless of donor type, have a high prevalence of long-term health-related complications. However, adverse medical late effects with significant morbidity were uncommon. Chronic GVHD is the most important predictor of adverse medical late effects and poor overall health.","['Baker, K Scott', 'Gurney, James G', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Francisco, Liton', 'McGlave, Philip B', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Snyder, David S', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Baker KS', 'Gurney JG', 'Ness KK', 'Bhatia R', 'Forman SJ', 'Francisco L', 'McGlave PB', 'Robison LL', 'Snyder DS', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Bhatia S']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA. baker084@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cataract/complications', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/complications', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Self Disclosure', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Siblings', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-03-1010 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43441-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1898-906. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-1010.

To develop more potent reagents, human immunoglobulin transgenic mice were used to generate a panel of immunoglobulin G1kappa (IgG1kappa) CD20 mAbs. All reagents bound strongly to CD20(+) cells and recruited mononuclear cells for the lysis of malignant B cells. However, 2 mAbs, 2F2 and 7D8, were exceptionally active in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), being able to lyse a range of rituximab-resistant targets, such as CD20-low chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in the presence of human plasma or unfractionated blood. Further analysis showed that 2F2 and 7D8, like rituximab, redistributed CD20 into Triton X-100-insoluble regions of the plasma membrane, but that they had markedly slower off-rates. To determine whether off-rate influenced CDC, a non-complement activating F(ab')(2) antihuman kappa reagent was used. This reagent markedly slowed the off-rate of rituximab and increased its CDC activity to that of 2F2 and 7D8. Thus, with increasing evidence that mAb therapeutic activity in vivo depends on complement activation, these new CD20 reagents with their slow off-rates and increased potency in CDC hold considerable promise for improved clinical activity.","['Teeling, Jessica L', 'French, Ruth R', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'van den Brakel, Jeroen', 'Pluyter, Marielle', 'Huang, Haichun', 'Chan, Claude', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Hack, C Erik', 'Dechant, Michael', 'Valerius, Thomas', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Glennie, Martin J']","['Teeling JL', 'French RR', 'Cragg MS', 'van den Brakel J', 'Pluyter M', 'Huang H', 'Chan C', 'Parren PW', 'Hack CE', 'Dechant M', 'Valerius T', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Glennie MJ']","['Genmab, Yalelaan 60, 3584 CM Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement Fixation Tests', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0039 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43426-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1793-800. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0039.

A model for animal cells.,87-96,"A baby-machine system that produces newborn Escherichia coli cells from cultures immobilised on a membrane was developed many years ago in an attempt to attain optimal synchrony with minimal disturbance of steady-state growth, and a model designed to characterise the nature and quality of the synchrony of such cells in a quantitative manner has been published. The baby machine has now been adapted for animal cells, and the present article is an attempt to modify the model to include these cells as well. The model consists of five elements, giving rise to five adjustable parameters (and a proportionality constant): a major, essentially synchronous group of cells with ages distributed normally about zero; a minor, random component from a steady-state population on the membrane that had undergone only very little age selection during the elution process; a fixed background count, to allow for the signals recorded by the electronic particle counter produced by debris and electronic noise; a time-shift, to account for differences between time of cell division and end of sample collection; and the coefficient of variation of the interdivision-time distribution, taken to be reciprocal-normal. It is this last feature, a reciprocal-normal rather than a Pearson type III interdivision-time distribution, that distinguishes this version of the model from its predecessor. The model is fitted by unconstrained non-linear least-squares to data from three different leukemia cell lines. The standard errors of the parameters are quite small in all cases, making their estimates highly significant; the quality of the fit is striking. The five parameters of the model can be divided into two nuisance parameters, two that are associated with the methodology and one that describes an inherent property of the cell itself; it turns out that both methodology parameters are zero in all three data sets studied. We also discuss the partition of the transition-time dispersion between the age distribution of the newborn cells and the age distribution of dividing cells and show that a reliable estimate of the corresponding parameters requires an experiment that extends over at least two and a half doubling times.","['Grover, N B', 'Eward, K L', 'Helmstetter, C E']","['Grover NB', 'Eward KL', 'Helmstetter CE']","['Hubert H.

However, although chromosome 13 aberrations are a nonrandom event in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), their biological and clinical associations are limited. We have studied a consecutive series of 277 cases of childhood ALL, including 33 initially at relapse, by conventional cytogenetic analysis. In 20 cases, a chromosome 13 aberration that involved the region 13q12 approximately q14 was detected at some point during the disease. An aberration was identified in 15 of 244 (6.1%) presentation cases and 7 of 54 (13%) relapsed cases, of which in 11 cases it was shown that the abnormality arose as a secondary karyotypic event. To further characterize the cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the commercially available probes LSI 13 (RB1) and D13S25 (both 13q14) was undertaken. These analyses provided additional evidence for the secondary nature of many events and suggested that 13q14 deletions may confer a growth advantage in culture because the percentage of cells containing 13q14 deletions detected by FISH was often lower than that detected by G-banding. Since 13q12 approximately q14 aberrations in childhood ALL frequently occur as secondary events, these results imply that the abnormality has implications for disease progression.","['Kovacs, Beata Zs', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Betts, David R']","['Kovacs BZ', 'Niggli FK', 'Betts DR']","[""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Steinwiesstrasse 75, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2003/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2003.09.022 [doi]', 'S0165460803004369 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2004 Jun;151(2):157-61. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2003.09.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response of leukemic cells to ionizing radiation is amplified when they have been pre-treated with the anticancer drug etoposide, therefore the aim of this work has been to establish the lowest etoposide concentration combined with the lowest ionizing radiation dose to obtain the best antineoplastic response. Two leukemic cell lines, HL-60 and Jurkat, employed in this study demonstrated different sensitivities to ionizing radiation and to etoposide treatment, with Jurkat T cells requiring a higher dose (1 microM) to display cell cycle perturbation and apoptotic DNA damage similar to those seen in HL-60. We hypothesize that this kind of response could be mediated by mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors and by SAPK/JNK metabolic pathway activation, both leading to caspase-3 cleavage. All in all these results provide insight into the sensitivity or resistance of leukemic cells to antineoplastic agents and identify molecular targets for rational therapeutic intervention strategies.","['Di Pietro, R', 'Centurione, L', 'Sabatini, N', 'Bosco, D', 'Sancilio, S', 'Garaci, F', 'Rana, R', 'Cataldi, A']","['Di Pietro R', 'Centurione L', 'Sabatini N', 'Bosco D', 'Sancilio S', 'Garaci F', 'Rana R', 'Cataldi A']","[""Dept Biomorphology, University G. d'Annunzio of Chieti, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/12/21 09:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10 [pii]', '10.1177/039463200401700210 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2004 May-Aug;17(2):181-90. doi: 10.1177/039463200401700210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have used an in vitro culture system in which stromal cells decidualise as indicated by a number of markers, including an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The latter was used as a quantitative marker of decidualisation in the presence of low (2%) fetal calf serum. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which is known to induce decidualisation, increased ALP activity, and this effect was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by indomethacin. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was then examined, but it had no effect on PGE(2) secretion. However, LIF suppressed ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 2% serum, while an inhibitor of LIF that competes for binding to its receptor reversed the effect of LIF and increased ALP activity above the control level. In serum-free cultures, stromal cells differentiated rapidly, and no differences were observed between LIF-treated and untreated cultures. Stromal cells produce LIF during in vitro culture, and this peaked at 48 h. Freshly collected stromal cells from both day-2 and -4 pregnant mice expressed mRNA for the LIF receptor, and the transcript level was higher in cells isolated on day 4. However, no differences were observed in the relative levels of transcripts in cells from day 2 and day 4 after culture, nor were there differences between the LIF-treated cultures and controls. Therefore, in this study, we have shown that LIF suppresses decidualisation of murine uterine stromal cells in the presence of serum, this is not due to the regulation of PGE(2) secretion by stromal cells.","['Fouladi Nashta, A A', 'Andreu, C V', 'Nijjar, N', 'Heath, J K', 'Kimber, S J']","['Fouladi Nashta AA', 'Andreu CV', 'Nijjar N', 'Heath JK', 'Kimber SJ']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Decidua/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Female', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Chaperones/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",,2004/06/03 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/06/03 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1677/joe.0.1810477 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2004 Jun;181(3):477-92. doi: 10.1677/joe.0.1810477.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib (Glivec, formerly STI571) is a highly selective inhibitor of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase which has shown a promising therapeutic activity in chronic myeloid leukemia as the first molecularly targeted antinoplastic treatment. METHODS: Between January 2001 and October 2001, 54 patients with chronic phase CML, resistant or intolerant to interferon-alpha were enrolled into the Novartis Expanded Access Study (Protocol 0113). Patients characteristics were as follows: male/female: 32/22, median age: 49 years (range: 22-75), median duration of disease: 44 months (range: 3-152). All patients received 400 mg imatinib orally. RESULTS: Complete hematologic response was obtained in 53 patients (96%) within 4 weeks. Major cytogenetic response (< 35% Ph+ metaphasis) was achieved after 6 months in 62.9%, and after 12 months in 64.8% of patients. Three patients progressed during the treatment (loss of complete hematologic response or cytogenetic response 1, blastic phase 2). The treatment was well tolerated, with mild side effects. Main non-hematologic side effects were weight gain and fluid retention. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that imatinib is highly active in inducing complete hematologic response and major cytogenetic response in most patients who failed interferon-alpha. Treatment was well tolerated with rare and mild adverse events and impressive improvement of quality of life.","['Molnar, Lenke', 'Nagy, Agnes', 'David, Marianna', 'Szomor, Arpad', 'Mehes, Gabor', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Losonczy, Hajna']","['Molnar L', 'Nagy A', 'David M', 'Szomor A', 'Mehes G', 'Kovacs G', 'Losonczy H']","['Pecsi Tudomanyegyetem, Orvos- es Egeszsegtudomanyi Centrum, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, I.

PROCEDURE: Thirty children with high-risk non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated according to the national protocol (PINDA 92) based on ALL BFM 90, were randomized to receive consolidation with four doses of either 1 or 2 g/m(2) MTX as a 24-hr infusion, at 2-week intervals (group M1 and M2, respectively). Serum MTX concentrations were measured at 24, 42, and 48 hr after beginning the infusion and were analyzed retrospectively. The creatinine clearance was calculated after 12-hr intravenous hydration prior to each MTX dose. Leucovorin dosage was adjusted according to creatinine clearance. RESULTS: Serum MTX concentrations at 24, 42, and 48 hr after starting the infusion were not related to creatinine clearance in both treatment groups. Leucovorin rescue administered according to creatinine clearance was excessive in 43% in group M1 and in 51% in group M2, as compared to the dose calculated according to serum MTX levels. No serious clinical complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that creatinine clearance is not a good parameter to calculate leucovorin rescue. MTX-related toxicity in this group of patients receiving a dose of 1 or 2 g/m(2) and rescued with leucovorin without monitoring serum MTX levels was acceptable.","['Joannon, Pilar', 'Oviedo, Iris', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Tordecilla, Juan']","['Joannon P', 'Oviedo I', 'Campbell M', 'Tordecilla J']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hospital Roberto del Rio, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile. pilarjoannon@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'MU72812GK0 (Creatine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Creatine/*blood', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control']",,2004/06/02 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2004/06/02 05:00'],"['2004/06/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20032 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Jul;43(1):17-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20032.,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fiber-retargeted adenoviral vectors with species B tropism can potentially bypass the CAR requirement and facilitate efficient gene transfer into malignant hematopoietic cells. METHODS: For feasible generation of fiber-retargeted adenoviral vectors, we have modified the versatile AdEasy system with a chimeric fiber gene encoding the Ad5 fiber tail domain and Ad35 fiber shaft and knob domains. An Ad5-based vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the PGK promoter with Ad35 fiber receptor specificity was generated (Ad5F35-GFP). The Ad5F35-GFP vector-mediated gene transfer efficiency was compared with a fiber non-modified Ad5-GFP vector, which also encodes the GFP gene under the control of the PGK promoter. RESULTS: We demonstrated that a variety of Ad5-refractory malignant myeloid and B lymphoid cell lines were highly permissive to the Ad5F35-GFP vector infection. Importantly, primary chronic myeloid leukemic (CML) cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells were superiorly transduced by the Ad5F35-GFP vector at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 compared with the Ad5-GFP vector. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will facilitate the generation of fiber-retargeted adenoviral vectors and enable transient genetic manipulation of primary malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Nilsson, Marcus', 'Ljungberg, Johan', 'Richter, Johan', 'Kiefer, Thomas', 'Magnusson, Mattias', 'Lieber, Andre', 'Widegren, Bengt', 'Karlsson, Stefan', 'Fan, Xiaolong']","['Nilsson M', 'Ljungberg J', 'Richter J', 'Kiefer T', 'Magnusson M', 'Lieber A', 'Widegren B', 'Karlsson S', 'Fan X']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University, SE-22184 Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein)', '0 (Integrin alphaV)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",IM,"['*Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic System/*pathology', 'Integrin alphaV/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Serotyping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2004/06/02 05:00,2005/01/29 09:00,['2004/06/02 05:00'],"['2004/06/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.543 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2004 Jun;6(6):631-41. doi: 10.1002/jgm.543.,,"['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We have developed a semiautomated analysis method for laser scanning cytometry (LSC) termed ""multiple thresholding,"" which is suitable for archived or fresh biopsy material of human lymph nodes and tonsils. Sections are stained with PI for nuclear DNA and up to four antigens using direct or indirect immunofluorescence staining. Measurement is triggered on DNA-fluorescence (argon laser, Ar) or on specific cell labeling. Due to the heterogeneity of cell density, measurements are performed repeatedly at different threshold levels (low threshold: regions of low cellular density, germinal center; high threshold: dense regions, mantle zone). Data are acquired by single- (Ar) or dual-laser excitation (Ar-HeNe) in order to analyze single- (FITC) up to four-color (FITC/PE/PECy5/APC) stained specimen. RESULTS: Percentage and cellular density of cell-subsets is quantified in different microanatomical regions of the specimen. These data were highly correlated with manual scoring of identical specimens (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.0001). With LSC, semiautomated operator-independent immunophenotyping in tissue sections of lymphatic organs with up to three antibodies simultaneously is possible.

INVESTIGATIONS: Haematological analysis revealed a pancytopenia with a sustained normochromic anemia (hemoglobin 6,2 g/dl), a mild leukopenia (leucocytes 3500/ microl) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 22000/ microl) requiring platelet substitution. Bone marrow aspirate revealed a dysplasia of all three lineages with reduced thrombopoiesis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Cytogenetic analysis detected a complex aberrant clone including loss of the critically deleted regions in 5q31 and 7q31, as well as structural changes of 12p. The diagnosis was refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia according to the WHO classification of myelodysplastic syndromes. TREATMENT AND COURSE: While allogeneic sibling transplantation was planned the patient developed spontaneous recurrent subdural haematoma and died due to persistent bleeding refractory to platelet substitution. CONCLUSION: Treatment with azathioprine may - depending on its cumulative dosage - lead to pancytopenia and subsequent development of myelodysplasia or secondary leukaemia, respectively. Complex genetic alterations involving chromosome 7 are characteristic.

Here, we report that, following IL-2 (interleukin-2) stimulation of human T lymphocytes, SHP-2 binds tyrosine residues 614 and 643 of human Gab2 through its N- and C-terminal SH2 domains respectively. However, the sole mutation of Tyr-614 into phenylalanine is sufficient to prevent Gab2 from recruiting SHP-2. Expression of the Gab2 Tyr-614-->Phe (Y614F) mutant, defective in SHP-2 association, prevents ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation and expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the c-fos SRE (serum response element), indicating that interaction of SHP-2 with Gab2 is required for ERK activation in response to IL-2. Further investigation of IL-2-dependent induction of SRE showed that expression of a constitutively active mutant of the RhoA GTPase synergizes with IL-2 for SRE-driven transcription, whereas a dominant-negative mutant reduces the IL-2 response. Thus, in response to IL-2, full induction of the SRE requires ERK-dependent as well as Rho-dependent signals that target the Ets-box and the CArG-box respectively. We also report that the synergy between Gab2/SHP-2 and RhoA for IL-2-dependent CArG-box-driven transcription depends upon MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase) activation, and is likely to involve regulation of the serum response factor co-activator MAL. Our studies thus provide new insights into the role of Gab2 and SHP-2 in IL-2 signal transduction.","['Arnaud, Mary', 'Mzali, Rym', 'Gesbert, Franck', 'Crouin, Catherine', 'Guenzi, Christine', 'Vermot-Desroches, Claudine', 'Wijdenes, John', 'Courtois, Genevieve', 'Bernard, Olivier', 'Bertoglio, Jacques']","['Arnaud M', 'Mzali R', 'Gesbert F', 'Crouin C', 'Guenzi C', 'Vermot-Desroches C', 'Wijdenes J', 'Courtois G', 'Bernard O', 'Bertoglio J']","['Inserm U461, Faculte de Pharmacie Paris-XI, 5 rue Jean-Baptiste Clement, 92290 Chatenay-Malabry, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (GAB2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (acute-phase protein rho)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*physiology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/physiology', 'Genes, fos/*physiology', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism/physiology', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Serum Response Element/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism/physiology', 'src Homology Domains/physiology']",,2004/06/02 05:00,2005/02/23 09:00,['2004/06/02 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20040103 [doi]', 'BJ20040103 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Sep 1;382(Pt 2):545-56. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040103.,,,,,,,,,PMC1133811,,,,,,,,,

We show here, by tracking individual human leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency mice serially transplanted with acute myeloid leukemia cells, that LSCs are not functionally homogeneous but, like the normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, comprise distinct hierarchically arranged LSC classes. Distinct LSC fates derived from heterogeneous self-renewal potential. Some LSCs emerged only in recipients of serial transplantation, indicating they divided rarely and underwent self-renewal rather than commitment after cell division within primary recipients. Heterogeneity in LSC self-renewal potential supports the hypothesis that they derive from normal HSCs. Furthermore, normal developmental processes are not completely abolished during leukemogenesis. The existence of multiple stem cell classes shows the need for LSC-targeted therapies.","['Hope, Kristin J', 'Jin, Liqing', 'Dick, John E']","['Hope KJ', 'Jin L', 'Dick JE']","['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, University Health Network, and Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Toronto, 620 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2C1, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells/pathology/transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*classification/*pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2003/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ni1080 [doi]', 'ni1080 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Immunol. 2004 Jul;5(7):738-43. doi: 10.1038/ni1080.

Treatment with imatinib is generally well tolerated, and the risk for severe adverse effects is low. Adverse effects most commonly include mild-to-moderate edema, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, and cutaneous reactions. Hepatic transaminase level elevations and myelosuppression occur less frequently and resolve with interruption of imatinib therapy. In general, the incidence and severity of adverse effects tend to correlate with imatinib dose and, in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, the phase of disease; but, patient age and other factors are also associated with some types of reactions. With prompt and appropriate intervention, adverse effects in imatinib-treated patients have proven to be manageable across the spectrum of severity, and they seldom require permanent cessation of therapy.

Currently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment modality with long-term data demonstrating curative potential in CML. An option for less than half of CML patients and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, transplantation may still be appropriate initial therapy for certain patients. Busulfan and hydroxyurea have no demonstrable effect on disease natural history.

Here we test the hypothesis that macrophages, stimulated by the dominant 110-120 kd fibronectin fragments (FNf), as are found in lymphatic fluid draining sites of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, produce factors that promote the survival of injured parenchymal cells. Rat splenic macrophages stimulated in vitro with purified FNf produced soluble factors that protected hypoxic rat cardiac myocytes from death by apoptosis. Addition of blocking antibodies specific for tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) partly reduced the protection against apoptosis provided to hypoxic cardiac myocytes by cell-free culture supernatants from FNf-stimulated macrophages. Complete blockade of this protection was achieved by a combination of antibodies specific for FGF-1, IGF-I, and LIF.

PIAS proteins have also been identified as E3 ligases for the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins. PIASy in particular has been reported to mediate SUMO-2/3 modification of LEF-1, sequestering it into nuclear bodies, and SUMO-1 ligation to c-Myb, modulating its transcriptional activation properties. We have cloned murine Piasy and a splice variant which omits exon 6, containing the nuclear retention PINIT motif. Cell culture studies indicate that both the full length and the splice variant are localized in the nucleus but differentially enhance SUMO ligation. To further understand the functions of PIASy, we have generated PIASy-deficient mice. Surprisingly, Piasy(-/-) mice appear phenotypically normal. Activation of STAT1 is not significantly perturbed in Piasy(-/-) cells, and sumoylation patterns for SUMO-1 or SUMO-3 modification are similar when comparing tissues and embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and knockout mice. Our study demonstrates that at steady state, PIASy is either dispensable or compensated for by other PIAS family members or by other mechanisms when deleted.","['Wong, Kelly A', 'Kim, Rachel', 'Christofk, Heather', 'Gao, Jing', 'Lawson, Gregory', 'Wu, Hong']","['Wong KA', 'Kim R', 'Christofk H', 'Gao J', 'Lawson G', 'Wu H']","['Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Piasy protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sumo3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Ubiquitins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics/physiology', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Targeting', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.12.5577-5586.2004 [doi]', '24/12/5577 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jun;24(12):5577-86. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.12.5577-5586.2004.,,,,,"['T32 GM007185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007549/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD07549/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC419860,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effects of PES1 and UBF1 on the growth and differentiation of cell lines derived from 32D cells, an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine myeloid cell line. Parental 32D cells and 32D IGF-IR cells (expressing increased levels of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor I [IGF-I] receptor [IGF-IR]) do not express insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) or IRS-2. 32D IGF-IR cells differentiate when the cells are shifted from IL-3 to IGF-I. Ectopic expression of IRS-1 inhibits differentiation and transforms 32D IGF-IR cells into a tumor-forming cell line. We found that PES1 and UBF1 increased cell size and/or altered the cell cycle distribution of 32D-derived cells but failed to make them IL-3 independent. PES1 and UBF1 also failed to inhibit the differentiation program initiated by the activation of the IGF-IR, which is blocked by IRS-1. 32D IGF-IR cells expressing PES1 or UBF1 differentiate into granulocytes like their parental cells. In contrast, PES1 and UBF1 can transform mouse embryo fibroblasts that have high levels of endogenous IRS-1 and are not prone to differentiation. Our results provide a model for one of the theories of myeloid leukemia, in which both a stimulus of proliferation and a block of differentiation are required for leukemia development.","['Prisco, Marco', 'Maiorana, Arianna', 'Guerzoni, Clara', 'Calin, George', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Voit, Renate', 'Grummt, Ingrid', 'Baserga, Renato']","['Prisco M', 'Maiorana A', 'Guerzoni C', 'Calin G', 'Calabretta B', 'Voit R', 'Grummt I', 'Baserga R']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Irs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (transcription factor UBF)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/physiology', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.12.5421-5433.2004 [doi]', '24/12/5421 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jun;24(12):5421-33. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.12.5421-5433.2004.,,,,,"['P01 CA078890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC419857,,,,,,,,,

The expression and contributions of Pbx2 to mammalian development remain undefined, in contrast to the essential roles recently established for family members Pbx1 and Pbx3. Here we report that Pbx2 is widely expressed during embryonic development, particularly in neural and epithelial tissues during late gestation. Despite wide Pbx2 expression, mice homozygous mutant for Pbx2 are born at the expected Mendelian frequencies and exhibit no detectable abnormalities in development and organogenesis or reduction of long-term survival. The lack of an apparent phenotype in Pbx2(-)/(-) mice likely reflects functional redundancy, since the Pbx2 protein is present at considerably lower levels than comparable isoforms of Pbx1 and/or Pbx3 in embryonic tissues. In postnatal bone marrow and thymus, however, Pbx2 is the predominant high-molecular-weight (MW)-isoform Pbx protein detectable by immunoblotting. Nevertheless, the absence of Pbx2 has no measurable effect on steady-state hematopoiesis or immune function in adult mice, suggesting possible compensation by low-MW-isoform Pbx proteins present in these tissues. We conclude that the roles of Pbx2 in murine embryonic development, organogenesis, hematopoiesis, immune responses, and long-term survival are not essential.","['Selleri, Licia', 'DiMartino, Jorge', 'van Deursen, Jan', 'Brendolan, Andrea', 'Sanyal, Mrinmoy', 'Boon, Elles', 'Capellini, Terence', 'Smith, Kevin S', 'Rhee, Joon', 'Popperl, Heike', 'Grosveld, Gerard', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Selleri L', 'DiMartino J', 'van Deursen J', 'Brendolan A', 'Sanyal M', 'Boon E', 'Capellini T', 'Smith KS', 'Rhee J', 'Popperl H', 'Grosveld G', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, USA. lis2008@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.12.5324-5331.2004 [doi]', '24/12/5324 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jun;24(12):5324-31. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.12.5324-5331.2004.,,,,,"['HD043997-01 A1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD043997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC419882,,,,,,,,,

The NSD1 gene product is a SET-domain histone lysine methyltransferase that has previously been shown to interact with nuclear receptors. We describe here a novel NSD1-interacting protein, Nizp1, that contains a SCAN box, a KRAB-A domain, and four consensus C2H2-type zinc fingers preceded by a unique finger derivative, referred to herein as the C2HR motif. The C2HR motif functions to mediate protein-protein interaction with the cysteine-rich (C5HCH) domain of NSD1 in a Zn(II)-dependent fashion, and when tethered to RNA polymerase II promoters, represses transcription in an NSD1-dependent manner. Mutations of the cysteine or histidine residues in the C2HR motif abolish the interaction of Nizp1 with NSD1 and compromise the ability of Nizp1 to repress transcription. Interestingly, converting the C2HR motif into a canonical C2H2 zinc finger has a similar effect. Thus, Nizp1 contains a novel type of zinc finger motif that functions as a docking site for NSD1 and is more than just a degenerate evolutionary remnant of a C2H2 motif.","['Nielsen, Anders Lade', 'Jorgensen, Poul', 'Lerouge, Thierry', 'Cervino, Margarita', 'Chambon, Pierre', 'Losson, Regine']","['Nielsen AL', 'Jorgensen P', 'Lerouge T', 'Cervino M', 'Chambon P', 'Losson R']","['Department of Human Genetics, Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nizp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Nsd1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nervous System Diseases/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Syndrome', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/*physiology']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.24.12.5184-5196.2004 [doi]', '24/12/5184 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Jun;24(12):5184-96. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.12.5184-5196.2004.,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AY303242'],,PMC419876,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single institution, retrospective study of germ cell tumor patients who underwent autologous transplantation using high-dose etoposide from 1987 to 2001. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients received high-dose etoposide and carboplatin followed by autologous stem-cell transplantations for germ cell tumors. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 166 months (median, 51 months). Three patients (2.6%; 95% CI, 0.55% to 7.50%) subsequently developed leukemia at an average of 16 months post-autologous transplantation (range, 11 to 21 months). All three had received tandem transplantations and had been heavily pretreated, including at least one prior cycle of etoposide. Following autologous transplantation, all three patients exhibited refractory cytopenias before developing overt leukemia. All leukemias were of myeloid lineage. One patient developed an M2 with a t(8,21) chromosomal translocation; another, an M5 with a t(11,19); and one patient exhibited an unclassified leukemia with cytogenetic abnormalities resulting in monosomy for 7p and partial monosomy of 7q. Treatment of the leukemias involved allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSION: High-dose chemotherapy using high-dose etoposide as therapy for relapsed germ cell tumors was associated with a 2.6% risk of developing a secondary myeloid leukemia. This figure was not significantly different from the expected rate of secondary leukemias when patients receive additional cycles of standard-dose etoposide as salvage chemotherapy for germ cell tumors. Other factors, including the use of platinum agents, may also have a role in leukemogenesis in this patient population.","['Houck, William', 'Abonour, Rafat', 'Vance, Gail', 'Einhorn, Lawrence H']","['Houck W', 'Abonour R', 'Vance G', 'Einhorn LH']","['Indiana Cancer Pavilion, 535 Barnhill Dr, RT #473, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5289, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indiana/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.11.054 [doi]', 'JCO.2004.11.054 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jun 1;22(11):2155-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.11.054.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventy-four women with metastatic breast cancer who had received one or no prior chemotherapy regimens were randomly assigned to one of three paclitaxel dosing regimens-175 mg/m(2), 210 mg/m(2), or 250 mg/m(2)-each administered as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Women completed self-administered quality of life and symptom assessment questionnaires at baseline and after three cycles of treatment. RESULTS: No evidence of a significant dose-response relationship was demonstrated over the dose range assessed. Response rates were 23%, 26%, and 21% for the three regimens, respectively. A marginally significant association (P =.04) was seen between dose and time to progression; however, in a multivariate analysis, the difference was even less apparent. No statistically significant difference was seen in survival. Neurotoxicity and hematologic toxicity were more severe on the higher dose arms. There was no significant difference in quality of life on the three arms. CONCLUSION: Higher doses of paclitaxel administered as a 3-hour infusion to women with metastatic breast cancer did not improve response rate, survival, or quality of life.

Here we combined fluorescence anisotropy, NMR, and small angle x-ray-scattering measurements to determine the affinities, molecular interfaces, and low resolution structure of the complex formed between PKBbeta-PH and p14(TCL1)/p13(MTCP1). We show that p14(TCL1)/p13(MTCP1) target PKB-PH at a site that has not yet been observed in PH-protein interactions. Located opposite the phospholipid binding pocket and distal from known protein-protein interaction sites on PH domains, the binding of dimeric TCL1 proteins to this site would allow the crosslinking of two PKB molecules at the cellular membrane in a preactivated conformation without disrupting certain PH-ligand interactions. Thus this interaction could serve to strengthen membrane association, promote trans-phosphorylation, hinder deactivation of PKB, and involve PKB in a multi-protein complex, explaining the array of known effects of TCL1.

This provirus can delete its envelope gene by LoxP/Cre mediated recombination and thereby allow superinfection of Cre recombinase expressing cells. RESULTS: In our studies, the virus repeatedly infected the cell and delivered multiple copies of the viral genome to the host genome; the superinfected cells expressed a viral transgene on average twenty times more than non-superinfected cells. The insertion of multiple LoxP sites into the cellular genome also led to genomic deletions, as demonstrated by comparative genome hybridization.

The function of Tax primarily relies on protein-protein interactions. We have previously shown that Tax upregulates the cell cycle checkpoint proteins p21/waf1 and cyclin D2. Here we describe the consequences of upregulating these G1/S checkpoint regulators in HTLV-1 infected cells. RESULTS: To further decipher any physical and functional interactions between cyclin D2 and p21/waf1, we used a series of biochemical assays from HTLV-1 infected and uninfected cells. Immunoprecipitations from HTLV-1 infected cells showed p21/waf1 in a stable complex with cyclin D2/cdk4. This complex is active as it phosphorylates the Rb protein in kinase assays. Confocal fluorescent microscopy indicated that p21/waf1 and cyclin D2 colocalize in HTLV-1 infected, but not in uninfected cells. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays using purified proteins demonstrated that the addition of p21/waf1 to cyclin D2/cdk4 increased the kinase activity of cdk4. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the p21/cyclin D2/cdk4 complex is not an inhibitory complex and that p21/waf1 could potentially function as an assembly factor for the cyclin D2/cdk4 complex in HTLV-1 infected cells. A by-product of this assembly with cyclin D2/cdk4 is the sequestration of p21/waf1 away from the cyclin E/cdk2 complex, allowing this active cyclin-cdk complex to phosphorylate Rb pocket proteins efficiently and push cells through the G1/S checkpoint. These two distinct functional and physical activities of p21/waf1 suggest that RNA tumor viruses manipulate the G1/S checkpoint by deregulating cyclin and cdk complexes.","['Kehn, Kylene', 'Deng, Longwen', 'de la Fuente, Cynthia', 'Strouss, Katharine', 'Wu, Kaili', 'Maddukuri, Anil', 'Baylor, Shanese', 'Rufner, Robyn', 'Pumfery, Anne', 'Bottazzi, Maria Elena', 'Kashanchi, Fatah']","['Kehn K', 'Deng L', 'de la Fuente C', 'Strouss K', 'Wu K', 'Maddukuri A', 'Baylor S', 'Rufner R', 'Pumfery A', 'Bottazzi ME', 'Kashanchi F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037, USA. bcmkwk@gwumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*physiology', 'Cyclins/genetics/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1742-4690-1-6 [doi]', '1742-4690-1-6 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Apr 13;1:6. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-6.,,,,20040413,"['R01 AI043894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 AI044357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI44357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC420262,,,,,,,,,

At first glance, the ability to transform and the ability to engender apoptosis seem to be contradictory. Interestingly, both abilities have been widely reported in the literature for the HTLV-I Tax protein. RESULTS: To reconcile these apparently divergent findings, we sought to understand how Tax might cause apoptosis in a Jurkat T-cell line, JPX-9. Tax expression can be induced equally by either cadmium (Cd) or zinc (Zn) in JPX-9 cells. Surprisingly, when induced by Zn, but not when induced by Cd, Tax-expression produced significant apoptosis. Under our experimental conditions, Zn but not Cd, induced SAPK (stress activated protein kinase)/JNK (Jun kinase) activation in cells. We further showed that transient over-expression of Tax-alone or Jun-alone did not induce cell death. On the other hand, co-expression of Tax plus Jun did effectively result in apoptosis. CONCLUSION: We propose that Tax-expression alone in a T-cell background insufficiently accounts for apoptosis. On the other hand, Tax plus activation of a stress kinase can induce cell death. Thus, HTLV-I infection/transformation of cells requires two discrete events (i.e. oncoprotein expression and stress) to produce apoptosis.","['Kasai, Takefumi', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh']","['Kasai T', 'Jeang KT']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA. tkasai@m.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology/*virology', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1742-4690-1-7 [doi]', '1742-4690-1-7 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 May 6;1:7. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-7.,,,,20040506,,,,,PMC419724,,,,,,,,,

A number of viruses have subsequently been identified to contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV and its opportunistic infections and cancers. Therefore, a multi-virus array containing eight human viruses implicated in AIDS pathogenesis was developed and its efficacy in various applications was characterized. RESULTS: The amplified open reading frames (ORFs) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human T cell leukemia virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6A and 6B, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus were spotted on glass slides and hybridized to DNA and RNA samples. Using a random priming method for labeling genomic DNA or cDNA probes, we show specific detection of genomic viral DNA from cells infected with the human herpesviruses, and effectively demonstrate the inhibitory effects of a cellular cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor on viral gene expression in HIV-1 and KSHV latently infected cells. In addition, we coupled chromatin immunoprecipitation with the virus chip (ChIP-chip) to study cellular protein and DNA binding. CONCLUSIONS: An amplicon based virus chip representing eight human viruses was successfully used to identify each virus with little cross hybridization. Furthermore, the identity of both viruses was correctly determined in co-infected cells. The utility of the virus chip was demonstrated by a variety of expression studies. Additionally, this is the first demonstrated use of ChIP-chip analysis to show specific binding of proteins to viral DNA, which, importantly, did not require further amplification for detection.","['Ghedin, Elodie', 'Pumfery, Anne', 'de la Fuente, Cynthia', 'Yao, Karen', 'Miller, Naomi', 'Lacoste, Vincent', 'Quackenbush, John', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Kashanchi, Fatah']","['Ghedin E', 'Pumfery A', 'de la Fuente C', 'Yao K', 'Miller N', 'Lacoste V', 'Quackenbush J', 'Jacobson S', 'Kashanchi F']","['The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA. eghedin@tigr.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Viruses/*genetics/*pathogenicity']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1742-4690-1-10 [doi]', '1742-4690-1-10 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 May 25;1:10. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-10.,,,,20040525,,,,['Retrovirology. 2004;1:11.

Several published reports suggest that HTLV-I may lead to decreased survival, but HTLV-II has not previously been associated with mortality. RESULTS: We examined deaths among 138 HTLV-I, 358 HTLV-II, and 759 uninfected controls enrolled in a prospective cohort study of U.S. blood donors followed biannually since 1992. Proportional hazards models yielded hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between mortality and HTLV infection, controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, age, income, educational level, blood center, smoking, injection drug use history, alcohol intake, hepatitis C status and autologous donation. After a median follow-up of 8.6 years, there were 45 confirmed subject deaths. HTLV-I infection did not convey a statistically significant excess risk of mortality (unadjusted HR 1.9, 95%CI 0.8-4.4; adjusted HR 1.9, 95%CI 0.8-4.6). HTLV-II was associated with death in both the unadjusted model (HR 2.8, 95%CI 1.5-5.5) and in the adjusted model (HR 2.3, 95%CI 1.1-4.9). No single cause of death appeared responsible for the HTLV-II effect.

Chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC) is a life-threatening complication in neutropenic patients because of the lack of responsive hematopoietic precursor cells. Resolution of Candida organ lesions after hematopoietic reconstitution may take months. Here, we report the case of a 19-year-old neutropenic woman with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia and candidiasis of liver, spleen, and kidneys. Antifungal treatment was initiated using fluconazole and caspofungin but was changed to itraconazole and caspofungin. Despite elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and detectable Candida organ lesions, antileukemic therapy was restarted with interleukin 2 at the same time as antimicrobial treatment. Eight weeks after the start of interleukin therapy, CRP levels and organ lesions were decreased significantly irrespective of continuing neutropenia. This case report describes the successful treatment of CDC during neutropenia using combination antifungal therapy and suggests controlled studies to establish optimal therapeutic strategies.","['Hubel, K', 'Chemnitz, J', 'Brochhagen, H G', 'Cornely, O A']","['Hubel K', 'Chemnitz J', 'Brochhagen HG', 'Cornely OA']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Klinikum der Universitat zu Koln, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9, 50924 Koln, Germany. kai.huebel@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Caspofungin', 'Chronic Disease', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Itraconazole/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lipopeptides', 'Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy', 'Peptides/*administration & dosage', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.e0315 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Apr;79(3):289-92. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.e0315.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAGE complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed from K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562 (K562/ADM) cells, and concatamer sequences were analyzed with SAGE 2000 software. We used 9792 tags in the identification of 1076 different transcripts, 296 of which were similarly expressed in K562 and K562/ADM cells. There were 343 genes more actively expressed in K562/ADM than in parental K562 cells and 437 genes expressed less often in K562/ADM cells. K562/ADM cells showed increased expression of well-known genes, including the genes for spectrin beta, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (EIF1A), RAD23 homolog B, laminin receptor 1, and polyA-, RAN-, and PAI-1 messenger RNA-binding proteins. K562/ADM cells showed decreased expression of the genes for fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), hemoglobin epsilon 1, N-myristoyltransferase 1, hemoglobin alpha 2, NADH dehydrogenase Fe-S protein 6, heat shock 90-kDa protein, and karyopherin beta 1. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the increased expression of EIF1A and the decreased expression of FADS1 in K562/ADM cells. Prior to this investigation, such differences in the expression of these genes in doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cells were unknown. Although we do not provide any evidence in the present report for the potential roles of these genes in drug resistance, SAGE may provide a perspective into our understanding of drug resistance in human leukemia that is different from that provided by cDNA microarray analysis.","['Ichikawa, Yoshikazu', 'Hirokawa, Makoto', 'Aiba, Namiko', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Komatsuda, Atsushi', 'Saitoh, Hirobumi', 'Kume, Masaaki', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Sawada, Ken-ichi']","['Ichikawa Y', 'Hirokawa M', 'Aiba N', 'Fujishima N', 'Komatsuda A', 'Saitoh H', 'Kume M', 'Miura I', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Akita University School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita 010-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.14.19.3 (FADS1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.03133 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Apr;79(3):276-82. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.03133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 6 female and 8 male patients had a median age of 63 years (range, 45-73 years), a median performance status of 0 (range, 0-2), and a median disease stage of IV. This study included patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 5), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (n = 2), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 2), follicular lymphoma (n = 2), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 1), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 1), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1).

Three patients (29%) and 9 patients (64%) experienced grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia, respectively. Two patients who received 30 mg/m2 (level 4) of CPT-11 developed sepsis. We concluded that the recommended dose of CPT-11 with carboplatin and dexamethasone is 25 mg/m2. No deaths were related to this chemotherapy, and no patient developed liver dysfunction.

Thus far, many studies have suggested that MRD detection to evaluate the response to chemotherapy is useful for predicting the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, few studies have reported on the significance of MRD in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because of small numbers of patients and limited availability of MRD markers. Therefore, we monitored MRD using currently available markers at several points during the treatment for childhood AML and tried to intensify the treatment based on the results of MRD. Thirty-one patients (26 de novo cases and 5 other cases) were examined for MRD between February 1999 and May 2002. After the first consolidation therapy (consolidation 1), the expression of Wilms tumor gene (WT1) and/or leukemia-specific fusion genes such as AML1/MTG8, PML/RAR alpha, and MYH11/CBF beta were analyzed. Patients with positive MRD but in hematological remission at that point were recommended to undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT). Positive WT1 expression (more than 10(3) copies/microgram RNA) was detected in 18 of 31 patients (58.1%) at onset. After consolidation 1 therapy, the WT1 expression became negative in 14 of 18 patients. The AML1/MTG8 fusion gene was expressed in 8 patients, PML/RAR alpha was expressed in 3 patients, and MYH11/CBF beta was expressed in 1 patient. Four of the 8 patients with AML1/MTG8 expression and all 3 with PML/RAR alpha expression also demonstrated positive WT1 expression at onset. Eight (5 de novo cases and 3 other cases) of the 31 patients had no available MRD markers. Four patients who showed pesistently high expression of WT1 after consolidation 1 therapy underwent SCT, and only 1 patient remained in complete remission (CR). Among 14 patients who became negative for WT1 expression, 6 patients received SCT for various reasons. Among 8 patients with the AML1/MTG8 fusion gene, 2 became MRD negative and 6 continued to be positive. Four of these 6 patients underwent SCT, and all but one who underwent syngeneic SCT became MRD negative. On the other hand, 1 of the 2 patients who continued on chemotherapy continued to be MRD positive, suggesting a graft-versus-leukemia effect in allogeneic SCT. All patients with the PML/RAR alpha and MYH11/CBF beta fusion gene continued to be in CR. The 3-year event-free survival in de novo AML was 69.4% +/- 9.8% (n = 26), a result that is encouraging and superior to other reported outcomes. Thus, an MRD-based treatment strategy together with conventional risk factors appears to be required for further improving the outcomes of AML.","['Miyamura, Takako', 'Sakata, Naoki', 'Okamura, Takayuki', 'Yasui, Masahiro', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Yagi, Keiko', 'Sako, Masahiro', 'Komada, Yoshihiro', 'Matsuyama, Takaharu', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Park, Yong-Dong', 'Kawa, Keisei']","['Miyamura T', 'Sakata N', 'Okamura T', 'Yasui M', 'Inoue M', 'Yagi K', 'Sako M', 'Komada Y', 'Matsuyama T', 'Oda M', 'Park YD', 'Kawa K']","['Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, 840 Murodo-cho, Izumi, Osaka 594-1101, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.03113 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2004 Apr;79(3):243-9. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.03113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1996 the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene was isolated from the region encompassing the most active fragile FRA3B locus, and recently the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase gene (WWOX) was identified at FRA16D. These 2 fragile genes are altered or deleted in various epithelial tumors and exhibit tumor suppressor function. Aberration or absence of WWOX expression recently was detected in primary hematopoietic malignancies. The aberration resulted not only from genomic deletions but also possibly from epigenetic modifications associated with expression of fragility.

He was diagnosed as having therapy-related acute myelgenous leukemia (t-AML) on the basis of the bone marrow findings and his chemotherapeutic agent history including alkylating agents. Complete remission was achieved by induction chemotherapy. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation was thought to be needed, the patient was thought to be ineligible for any myeloablative conditioning regimen because of his age and the history of long term chemoradiotherapy. A non-myeloblative regimen was thus selected. After preconditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and cytarabine, the patient underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from an HLA identical sibling donor. Complete donor chimeras were obtained on day 28 after transplantation. Regimen related toxicities over grade 2 were not observed. Although he suffered from mild chronic graft-versus-host disease(GVHD), he is in good condition without any signs of relapse during a follow-up period of 33 months. It is suggested that non-myeloablative transplantation is feasible and benefical for patients with t-AML who are often ineligible for myeloablative transplants because of their histories of long term chemoradiotherapies.","['Okuda, Mitsutaka', 'Nomura, Jun', 'Horiuchi, Takahiro', 'Miyamura, Koich', 'Sasaki, Takeshi']","['Okuda M', 'Nomura J', 'Horiuchi T', 'Miyamura K', 'Sasaki T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyagi Cancer Center.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods']",,2004/06/01 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2004/06/01 05:00'],"['2004/06/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2004/06/01 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2004 Apr;45(4):308-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MVD is the net result of cumulative phases of angiogenesis and angio-regression and is as such not an indicator of the ongoing angiogenesis at the time of biopsy. There is, therefore, a need for additional methods that allow the estimation of ongoing angiogenesis. Double immunostainings for CD34 and Ki-67 can be used on paraffin-embedded tissue to determine the endothelial proliferation fraction. The BM endothelial cells, as a component of the BM stroma, have a close interaction with the malignant cells. In MM, for example, they are involved in the specific homing and are a source of paracrine growth factors.

While an ECP greater than 0 was detected in 72% of MM, 75% of CMPS and 92% of AML, it was invariably observed (100%) in the BM metastases. The absence of ECP together with a MVD comparable with the control group in our MGUS cases supports the view that MGUS is a pre-angiogenic condition. Qualitative differences in microvessels were associated with growth patterns in MM and CLL and were observed between the different entities of CMPS. In one-third of the epithelial BM metastases, there was a focal CA IX immunoreactivity, which was never observed in the haematological diseases.","['De Raeve, H R', 'Vermeulen, P B', 'Vanderkerken, K', 'Harris, A L', 'Van Marck, E']","['De Raeve HR', 'Vermeulen PB', 'Vanderkerken K', 'Harris AL', 'Van Marck E']","['University Hospital Antwerp, Department of Pathology, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650, Edegem, Belgium.

However, not all studies confirm this association, so it is still a matter of debate. Moreover, their association with other molecular abnormalities is less studied. We have investigated the presence of FLT3-ITD and D835 mutations in AML patients and their correlation with clinical and biological disease characteristics. The presence of ITD was analyzed in diagnostic samples of 176 AML patients and the D835 mutation in 135 of these patients. In all these patients, the presence of four well-known molecular abnormalities were also simultaneously characterized: PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 and MLL rearrangements. In all, 41 (23%) patients harbored FLT3 mutations, with 34 (19.3%) of them positive for the ITD, and seven (5%) positive for the D835 mutation. Of the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients, 16 (27%) showed FLT3 mutations, more frequently in M3 hypogranular cases (62% versus 17%, P=0.001) and cases with the short (bcr3) PML-RARalpha isoform (69%, P=0.002). In contrast, FLT3 was never altered in patients with inv(16), t(8;21) or 11q23 abnormalities. FLT3 mutations were significantly associated with some negative prognostic features at diagnosis (leukocytosis, high blast-cell percentage, and elevated LDH values), but they were not associated with different disease-free or overall survival. Therefore, we confirm a high frequency of FLT3 mutations in APL and in adult AML without recurrent cytogenetic translocations.

However, these staging systems do not identify those patients with early-stage disease who will progress to require treatment. Recent developments have provided a variety of prognostic markers, which can determine those patients with poor prognosis disease. For example, serum markers (soluble CD23), cell surface (CD38) and cytoplasmic (ZAP70) proteins, cytogenetics and immunoglobulin gene mutational status have all been utilised for this purpose. In order for patients to benefit fully from these discoveries they need to be translated into rapid, standardised and cost-effective clinical laboratory tests.

STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial biopsy specimens that were obtained from women (n=3) who underwent surgery for ectopic pregnancy were matched with biopsy specimens in a nonpregnant luteal phase from the same patients. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for leukemia inhibitory factor and homeobox a10 was performed. Polymerase chain reaction products were assayed with laser detection of nanogram quantities of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid. Ratios of each implantation marker to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard were compared for quantification. RESULTS: Leukemia inhibitory factor expression is increased in endometrium from ectopic pregnancy; homeobox a10 is increased in luteal phase endometrium. CONCLUSION: Leukemia inhibitory factor appears to be regulated by human chorionic gonadotropin or other factors of pregnancy; homeobox a10 is regulated by ovarian steroids of the luteal phase.,"['McMinn, Missy J', 'Hines, Randall S', 'Walley, Rana B', 'Cowan, Bryan D']","['McMinn MJ', 'Hines RS', 'Walley RB', 'Cowan BD']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Culture Techniques', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis', 'History, 16th Century', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*analysis', 'Luteal Phase/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Ectopic/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ajog.2004.01.071 [doi]', 'S0002937804001565 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2004 May;190(5):1419-21. doi: 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.01.071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since immunohistochemical demonstration of cyclin D1 is notoriously difficult, this study aims to assess whether a newly available rabbit MAb against cyclin D1 (SP4) can improve the consistency of immunostaining, especially for the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). A total of 150 cases of lymphoproliferative lesions, including 30 cases of MCL, histologic mimickers of MCL, and various types of lymphomas and leukemias, were studied. Immunostaining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using a labeled streptavidin-biotin peroxidase system in an automated immunostainer. All cases of MCL expressed cyclin D1, with a higher median staining score (8 out of a maximum of 12) compared with mouse MAb DCS-6 (score 4). In addition, 2 of 15 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 3 of 12 cases of multiple myeloma, and 2 of 5 cases of hairy cell leukemia were also positive. Comparable staining results could also be achieved by an optimized manual staining protocol. This study thus confirms the superior performance of the rabbit MAb SP4, which should permit consistent immunostaining for cyclin D1 to be readily achieved. The value of cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of MCL from other low-grade B-cell lymphomas is also affirmed, but with the caveat that rare cases of B-CLL can also be cyclin D1 positive.","['Cheuk, Wah', 'Wong, Kathy O Y', 'Wong, Cesar S C', 'Chan, John K C']","['Cheuk W', 'Wong KO', 'Wong CS', 'Chan JK']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong, SAR China. cheuk_wah@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Biotin', 'Cyclin D1/analysis/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/pathology', 'Rabbits', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods', 'Streptavidin']",,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/06/26 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['00000478-200406000-00013 [pii]', '10.1097/01.pas.0000126054.95798.94 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2004 Jun;28(6):801-7. doi: 10.1097/01.pas.0000126054.95798.94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Flow cytometric immune phenotyping and spontaneous apoptosis analysis of the bone marrow mononuclear cell preparation of the index case were performed. Microparticles isolated form the bone marrow sample were also studied for the presence of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles. List mode analysis of 225 cases of acute leukaemia or lymphoma with previously performed immune phenotyping was also carried out. RESULTS: The presence of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles could be detected by flow cytometry and they were found to be different from apoptotic bodies. Leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles were released in all cases of mature B cell neoplasms studied, although this phenomenon was rare in precursor B cell disorders and acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The generation of leukaemia/lymphoma cell microparticles in mature B cell neoplasms appears to be a common phenomenon. The pathogenesis and clinical implications must be investigated.","['Savasan, S', 'Buyukavci, M', 'Buck, S', 'Ravindranath, Y']","['Savasan S', 'Buyukavci M', 'Buck S', 'Ravindranath Y']","[""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. ssavasan@med.wayne.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.2003.011643 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2004 Jun;57(6):651-3. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2003.011643.,,,,,,,,,PMC1770322,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Approximately 19500 routine bone marrow biopsies were evaluated. Immunostaining with antibodies against tryptase, KIT, and CD25 and molecular analysis for detection of C-KIT point mutations were performed in approximately 550/4100 myelogenous malignancies including mastocytosis, almost all subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome (MDS/MPD), MPD, and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). RESULTS: SM was rare-it was diagnosed in only 64 bone marrows (0.3%) and made up 1.5% of myelogenous tumours. SM-AHNMD was the second most frequent subtype (20). SM-AHNMD was never included in the clinical differential diagnoses and was confirmed histologically in most cases only after appropriate immunostaining. The abnormal mast cell phenotype was confirmed by immunohistochemical demonstration of tryptase and CD25 coexpression. The following associated haematological neoplasms were found: MDS/MPS, AML, MPS, MDS, plasma cell myeloma, and unclassifiable myelogenous malignancy. C-KIT point mutations were detected in 16 of 20 cases. CONCLUSIONS: SM-AHNMD can be diagnosed histologically in bone marrow trephines only after immunostaining with antibodies against tryptase, KIT, and CD25. Eighteen of 20 AHNMDs were of myeloid origin. C-KIT point mutations were present in 16 of 20 cases. The prognostic relevance of detecting SM associated with another haematological neoplasm remains unclear, but mast cell resistance to most cytoreductive agents is of major importance for treatment planning.","['Horny, H-P', 'Sotlar, K', 'Sperr, W R', 'Valent, P']","['Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Lubeck, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany. horny@patho.mu-luebeck.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics']",,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.2003.014860 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2004 Jun;57(6):604-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2003.014860.,,,,,,,,,PMC1770310,,,,,,,,,

The drug has acquired therapeutic relevance because of similar inhibitory activity against certain activating mutations of these molecular targets. The archetypical disease in this regard is chronic myeloid leukemia, where abl is constitutively activated by fusion with the bcr gene (bcr/abl). Similarly, the drug has now been shown to display equally impressive therapeutic activity in eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloproliferative disorders that are characterized by activating mutations of either the PDGFRB or the PDGFRA gene. The former usually results from translocations involving chromosome 5q31-33, and the latter usually results from an interstitial deletion involving chromosome 4q12 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA). In contrast, imatinib is ineffective, in vitro and in vivo, against the mastocytosis-associated c-kit D816V mutation. However, wild-type and other c-kit mutations might be vulnerable to the drug, as has been the case in gastrointestinal stomal cell tumors. Imatinib is considered investigational for the treatment of hematologic malignancies without a defined molecular drug target, such as polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, and acute myeloid leukemia.","['Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mastocytosis', 'Metaplasia/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",117,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0246 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43345-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Oct 1;104(7):1931-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0246.

The FLT3 tyrosine kinase represents a promising target in pediatric AML. FLT3 is constitutively activated either by an internal tandem duplication (ITD) or by a point mutation (PM) in 17% to 24% of pediatric AML cases. Autocrine stimulation of wild-type (WT) FLT3 by coexpressed FLT3 ligand (FL) occurs in many other cases. FLT3/ITD mutations confer a particularly poor prognosis in pediatric AML patients. Inhibitors of FLT3 are being tested in adult AML patients, with promising preliminary results. In this study, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays were performed on 44 diagnostic pediatric AML blast samples (14 FLT3/WT, 15 FLT3/ITD, 15 FLT3/PM) using CEP-701, a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor. Pronounced cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis were observed in a higher percentage of FLT3/ITD samples (93%) than FLT3/PM (27%) or FLT3/WT (29%). The cytotoxicity was greatest in samples with a high FLT3/ITD mutant-to-wild-type allelic ratio. The addition of FL enhanced the survival and augmented the sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition for the CEP-701-responsive subset of FLT3/WT and FLT3/PM samples. Clinical testing of FLT3 inhibitors as molecularly targeted agents for the improvement of outcome of pediatric AML patients is warranted.","['Brown, Patrick', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Levis, Mark', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Lange, Beverly', 'Arceci, Robert', 'Small, Donald']","['Brown P', 'Meshinchi S', 'Levis M', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing R', 'Lange B', 'Arceci R', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-03-1034 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43432-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1841-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-1034.

The association of increased iron load with cancer may be due to several factors including free radical production, reduction of the body's protective mechanism to combat oxidative stress, inhibition of immune systems, inhibition of essential nutrient functions, facilitation of cancer growth, suppression of antitumor actions of macrophages, and lowering of the ratio of T4-T8 positive lymphocytes. Antiproliferative effects of desferoxamine (DFO) both in vitro and in vivo are mediated by an intracellular pool of iron that is necessary for DNA synthesis rather than prevention of iron uptake from transferrin. Several clinical studies have shown it to have antitumor activity in the treatment of neuroblastoma, leukemia, bladder carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Human neural tumor cells are susceptible to the effects of DFO. Continued study of DFO is necessary to further elucidate its antineoplastic profile and its use as an adjunct to current chemotherapy regimens. Given the lack of satisfactory treatment of central nervous system neoplasms, DFO could serve as an important tool in the management of such cancers.","['Dayani, Pouya N', 'Bishop, Maria C', 'Black, Keith', 'Zeltzer, Paul M']","['Dayani PN', 'Bishop MC', 'Black K', 'Zeltzer PM']","['Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Deferoxamine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*therapeutic use']",63,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/06/29 05:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/b:neon.0000024238.21349.37 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2004 May;67(3):367-77. doi: 10.1023/b:neon.0000024238.21349.37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of rodents exposed to radiolabeled BZ found a low level of radiolabel in isolated DNA with no preferential binding in target tissues of neoplasia. Adducts were not identified by 32P-postlabeling (equivalent to a covalent binding index <0.002) under the dosage conditions producing neoplasia in the rodent bioassays, and this method would have detected adducts at 1/10,000th the levels reported in the DNA-binding studies. Adducts were detected by 32P-postlabeling in vitro and following high acute BZ doses in vivo, but levels were about 100-fold less than those found by DNA binding. These findings suggest that DNA-adduct formation may not be a significant mechanism for BZ-induced neoplasia in rodents. The evaluation of other genotoxicity test results revealed that BZ and its metabolites did not produce reverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium but were clastogenic and aneugenic, producing micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and DNA strand breaks. Rodent and human data were compared, and BZ genotoxicity results in both were similar for the available tests. Also, the biotransformation of BZ was qualitatively similar in rodents, humans and non-human primates, further indicating that rodent and human genotoxicity data were compatible. The genotoxicity test results for BZ and its metabolites were the most similar to those of topoisomerase II inhibitors and provided less support for proposed mechanisms involving DNA reactivity, mitotic spindle poisoning or oxidative DNA damage as genotoxic mechanisms; all of which have been demonstrated experimentally for BZ or its metabolites. Studies of the chromosomal translocations found in BZ-exposed persons and secondary human leukemias produced by topoisomerase II inhibitors provide some additional support for this mechanism being potentially operative in BZ-induced leukemia.","['Whysner, John', 'Reddy, M Vijayaraj', 'Ross, Peter M', 'Mohan, Melissa', 'Lax, Elizabeth A']","['Whysner J', 'Reddy MV', 'Ross PM', 'Mohan M', 'Lax EA']","['Division of Pathology and Toxicology, American Heath Foundation, 1 Dana Road, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA. whysner@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Biological Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",350,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5742(03)00053-X [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5742(03)00053-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2004 Mar;566(2):99-130. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5742(03)00053-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total number of patient-samples examined was 119 (58 males and 61 females; mean age 35 yrs, 1-79 yrs). Based on the final diagnoses, nine patient groups were studied: a control group, meningitis, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), dementia, hydrocephalia, polyneuropathy-motor neuron disease, acute cerebral infarction (ACI), and patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. S-100 protein concentrations were measured by the Sangtec 100 two-site immunoradiometric assay. The highest S-100 levels in CSF were found in the dementia group, ACI group, bacterial-fungal and lymphocytic meningitis groups (Kruskal-Wallis test). The S-100 concentrations in these groups were significantly higher compared with the control group (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05, p<0.01) and the multiple sclerosis group (p<0.05, p<0.01). No other significant differences were found between groups. Our results suggest that the high protein levels in CSF found in these pathologies may reflect the presence of brain damage. However, the levels need to be considered individually, as they depend on several factors, such as age, severity of brain damage or interval between the onset of brain damage and the taking of the sample.","['Infante, J R', 'Martinez, A', 'Ochoa, J', 'Canadillas, F', 'Torres-Avisbal, M', 'Vallejo, J A', 'Gonzalez, F M', 'Pacheco, C', 'Latre, J M']","['Infante JR', 'Martinez A', 'Ochoa J', 'Canadillas F', 'Torres-Avisbal M', 'Vallejo JA', 'Gonzalez FM', 'Pacheco C', 'Latre JM']","['Nuclear Medicine Department, Hospital U.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hypotonic RPMI medium (146 mOsm) was used to induce non-lethal osmotic swelling of human myelomonocytic leukaemia U937 cells. Hypotonia for 10 min was started just before exposure to 1 MHz ultrasound at 0.5 or 1.0 Wcm(-2) for 10 min, or 5 min before exposure to 2.0 Wcm(-2) for 1 min. Surviving intact cells were then determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test immediately after treatment. After 6-h incubation of the treated cells, early apoptosis and secondary necrosis were measured using a flow cytometer. Intracellular free calcium ion imaging by Fura-2 fluorescence and cellular ion scanning using a secondary ion mass spectrometer were also performed. RESULTS: Enhancement of ultrasound-induced cell lysis was observed at all intensities, and most prominently at 2.0 Wcm(-2), while apoptosis induction was significantly enhanced at intensities of 0.5 and 1.0 Wcm(-2), but not at 2.0 Wcm(-2). The enhanced cell lysis is attributed to the increased susceptibility of the cells to mechanical damage. This is consistent with previous reports describing the effects of mechanical stresses on cell membranes. Cellular ion scanning images also suggest that hypotonia has an effect on the membrane damage-and-repair mechanism of the cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that non-lethal hypotonia can enhance ultrasound-induced cell killing. These findings also suggest the 'sonomechanical' nature of the effects on the cells.","['Feril, L B Jr', 'Kondo, T', 'Takaya, K', 'Riesz, P']","['Feril LB Jr', 'Kondo T', 'Takaya K', 'Riesz P']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Ions)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'DNA/*radiation effects', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ions', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Muscle Hypotonia', 'Necrosis', 'Osmosis', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', '*Ultrasonics']",,2004/05/29 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/05/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/05/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000310001654684 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2004 Feb;80(2):165-75. doi: 10.1080/09553000310001654684.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed these molecular markers are very useful for diagnosing thrombus formation, disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC), and the indicator of treatment of DIC. But these molecular parameters are not enough and difficult for prognosis of the disease or predicting the complication of patients as the most important subject for clinicians. The soluble fibrin monomer-fibrinogen complex (SF) is a complex coupling fibrin monomer and fibrinogen molecules to be formed in the early-activated state of blood coagulation. Thus such a molecular complex is expected to serve as a parameter for the diagnosis of thrombus formation and DIC, in particular its early stage. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a potential usefulness of a newly developed SF test utilizing an SF specific monoclonal antibody (IF-43). We measured SF together with established other parameters in 195 patients with DIC, subclinical DIC/hypercoagulable state, and non-DIC. The diagnosis of DIC was made based on a modified version of the criteria established by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan. Underlying disease includes leukemia, malignant lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple injury, giant ovarian tumor, prostatic cancer with multiple bone metastasis, lung cancer, breast cancer with multiple lung and bone metastasis, severe pneumoniae, sepsis, hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), and rheumatoid arthritis. The SF levels in DIC patients were significantly higher than those in the subclinical DIC/hypercoagulable state, and the non-DIC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis shows that the specificity and sensitivity of the SF assay appears to be satisfactory. As the level of SF reflects the thrombin generation activity in plasma, it would serve as a strong tool to selectively kick up the state of thrombin generation. These results indicate that the SF could be a specific and reliable parameter for the diagnosis of DIC and contribute to legitimate managements of patients with DIC. The excessive life response to serious clinical insults, such as sepsis, severe pancreatitis, trauma and shock, is called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Once SIRS occurs, people may often die from serious complications such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ failure (MOF). Especially, ALI followed by pneumoniae associated with SIRS could depend on patient's prognosis and life. That is to say, it seems to be urgent for clinicians to make differential diagnosis between Pneumoniae associated with SIRS and Coagulopathy (PASC) and Simple Pneumoniae (SP). Soluble fibrin monomer-fibrinogen complex(SF) is formed in the early-activated state of blood coagulation. Thus such a molecular complex is expected to serve as a parameter for the diagnosis of coagulopathy, in particular its early stage. The aim of the present study is to make differential diagnosis between Pneumoniae associated with SIRS and Coagulopathy (PASC) and Simple Pneumoniae(SP) by using a newly developed SF test utilizing an SF specific monoclonal antibody (IF-43). We measured SF together with established other parameters, hemogram, blood laboratory items in 7 patients with PASC and 17 patients with SP. The diagnosis of Pneumoniae was defined according to the criteria: clinical symptoms abnormal shadow in both Chest X-p and Chest CT, increased level of CRP, number of WBC. The diagnosis of SIRS was based on the criteria established by American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Consensus Conference held in August of 1991 in Northbrook, IL (USA). Underlying disease includes leukemias, malignant lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura(ITP), multiple injury (bone fracture), cerebral hemorrhage, enterocolitis, Appendicitis, lung cancer, larynx cancer, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia(BOOP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), sepsis. The SF levels in PASC patients are significantly higher than those in SP patients (p < 0.001). Otherwise, there is no significant difference of the CRP levels between in PASC group and SP group (p < ns). There is no co-relationship between SF level and D-dimer level. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis shows that the specificity and sensitivity of the SF assay appears to be quite satisfactory. As the level of SF reflects the thrombin generation activity in plasma, it would serve as a strong tool to selectively kick up the state of thrombin generation. These results indicate that the SF could be a specific and reliable parameter for the diagnosis of PASC and contribute to legitimate managements of patients with PASC.","['Koga, Shin']",['Koga S'],"['Division of Blood Transfusion Medicine and Hematology (Hematology Medicine), Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama 641-8510.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Basophilic differentiation on light microscopy was evident from the coarse basophilic granules in blasts, a progressive maturation of blasts toward basophils, and toluidine positivity on cytochemistry. Blasts showed a myeloid immunophenotype (CD13+, CD33+, CD117+) with a characteristic dual positivity for CD34 and CD25, highly suggestive of basophilic nature of the blasts.

They have been shown to interact with the cellular proteins TSG101, Nedd4, and AP2 or AIP, respectively. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has a PPPY and a PTAP motif, separated by two amino acids, located at the end of MA, but only the PPPY motif is conserved in the deltaretrovirus group. Like other retroviral peptides carrying the late motif, MA is mono- or di-ubiquitinated. A mutational analysis showed that 90% of PPPY mutant particles were retained in the cell compared to 15% for the wild-type virus. Mutations of the PTAP motif resulted in a 20% decrease in particle release. In single-cycle infectivity assays, the infectious titers of late motif mutants correlated with the amounts of released virus, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We observed binding of MA to the WW domains of the Nedd4 family member WWP1 but not to the amino-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant domain of TSG101 in mammalian two-hybrid analyses. The binding to WWP1 was eliminated when the PPPY motif was mutated. However, MA showed binding to TSG101 in the yeast two-hybrid system that was dependent on an intact PTAP motif. A dominant-negative (DN) mutant of WWP1 could inhibit budding of the intact HTLV-1 virus. In contrast, DN TSG101 only affected the release of virus-like particles encoded by Gag expression plasmids. Electron and fluorescent microscopy showed that Gag accumulates in large patches in the membranes of cells expressing viruses with PPPY mutations. Very few tethered immature particles could be detected in these samples, suggesting that budding is impaired at an earlier step than in other retroviruses.","['Heidecker, Gisela', 'Lloyd, Patricia A', 'Fox, Kristi', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Derse, David']","['Heidecker G', 'Lloyd PA', 'Fox K', 'Nagashima K', 'Derse D']","['Molecular Biology of Retroviruses Section, Basic Research Lab, National Cancer Institute/NIH, NCI-Frederick, Bldg. 567, Rm. 155, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA. heidecke@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)']",IM,"['*Amino Acid Motifs/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Precursors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.12.6636-6648.2004 [doi]', '78/12/6636 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jun;78(12):6636-48. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.12.6636-6648.2004.,,,,,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CO 12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC416494,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have suggested that modification of PML by SUMO is essential to form PODs and that IE1 both binds to PML and may disrupt PODs by preventing or removing SUMO adducts on PML. In this study, we showed that in contrast to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) IE110 (ICP0), the loss of sumoylated forms of PML by cotransfected IE1 was resistant to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and that IE1 did not reduce the level of unmodified PML. Reduced sumoylation of PML was also observed in U373 cells after infection with wild-type HCMV and proved to require IE1 protein expression. Mutational analysis revealed that the central hydrophobic domain of IE1, including Leu174, is required for both PML binding and loss of PML sumoylation and confirmed that all IE1 mutants tested that were deficient in these functions also failed both to target to PODs and to disrupt PODs. These same mutants were also inactive in several reporter gene transactivation assays and in inhibition of PML-mediated repression. Importantly, a viral DNA genome containing an IE1 gene with a deletion [IE1(Delta290-320)] that was defective in these activities was not infectious when transfected into permissive fibroblast cells, but the mutant IE1(K450R), which is defective in IE1 sumoylation, remained infectious. Our mutational analysis strengthens the idea that interference by IE1 with both the sumoylation of PML and its repressor activity requires a physical interaction with PML that also leads to disruption of PODs. These activities of IE1 also correlate with several unusual transcriptional transactivation functions of IE1 and may be requirements for efficient initiation of the lytic cycle in vivo.","['Lee, Hye-Ra', 'Kim, Do-Jun', 'Lee, Jang-Mi', 'Choi, Cheol Yong', 'Ahn, Byung-Yoon', 'Hayward, Gary S', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun']","['Lee HR', 'Kim DJ', 'Lee JM', 'Choi CY', 'Ahn BY', 'Hayward GS', 'Ahn JH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, 300 Chunchundong Jangangu, Suwon, Kyonggido 440-746, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.12.6527-6542.2004 [doi]', '78/12/6527 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jun;78(12):6527-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.12.6527-6542.2004.,,,,,"['R01 AI024576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC416510,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about epitope specificities and functional roles of the Gag-specific helper T-cell responses in terms of vaccine-induced protection against a pathogenic retroviral challenge. We have previously demonstrated that immunization with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) Gag proteins protects mice against the fatal Friend retrovirus (FV) infection. We report here the structure of a protective T helper cell (Th) epitope, (I)VTWEAIAVDPPP, identified in the p15 (MA) region of F-MuLV Gag. In mice immunized with the Th epitope-harboring peptide or a vaccinia virus-expressed native full-length MA protein, FV-induced early splenomegaly regressed rapidly. In these mice, FV-infected cells were eliminated within 4 weeks and the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies was induced rapidly after FV challenge, resulting in strong protection against the virus infection. Interestingly, mice immunized with the whole MA mounted strong CD4+ T-cell responses to the identified Th epitope, whereas mice immunized with mutant MA proteins that were not bound to the plasma membrane failed to mount efficient CD4+ T-cell responses, despite the presence of the Th epitope. These mutant MA proteins also failed to induce strong protection against FV challenge. These data indicate the importance of the properly processible MA molecule for CD4+ T-cell priming and for the resultant induction of an effective immune response against retrovirus infections.","['Sugahara, Daisuke', 'Tsuji-Kawahara, Sachiyo', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki']","['Sugahara D', 'Tsuji-Kawahara S', 'Miyazawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, 377-2 Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka 589-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/prevention & control', 'Tumor Virus Infections/prevention & control', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.12.6322-6334.2004 [doi]', '78/12/6322 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jun;78(12):6322-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.12.6322-6334.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC416509,,,,,,,,,

Such detection is azidothymidine sensitive and corresponded to neosynthesized products of the reverse transcriptase. This observation was confirmed in two additional human cell lines, TE671 and ARPE-19. Using cell fractionation combined with careful controls, we found that a two-long-terminal-repeat (two-LTR) junction molecule was detectable in the cytoplasm as early as 2 h post virus entry. Altogether, our data indicated that the neosynthesized retroviral DNA led to the early formation of structures including true two-LTR junctions in the cytoplasm of MLV-infected cells. Thus, the classical assumption that two-LTR circles are a mitosis-dependent dead-end product accumulating in the nucleus must be reconsidered. MLV-derived products containing a two-LTR junction can no longer be used as an exclusive surrogate for the preintegration complex nuclear translocation event.","['Serhan, Fatima', 'Penaud, Magalie', 'Petit, Caroline', 'Leste-Lasserre, Thierry', 'Trajcevski, Stephane', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Duisit, Ghislaine', 'Sonigo, Pierre', 'Moullier, Philippe']","['Serhan F', 'Penaud M', 'Petit C', 'Leste-Lasserre T', 'Trajcevski S', 'Klatzmann D', 'Duisit G', 'Sonigo P', 'Moullier P']","['INSERM ERM 0-105, CHU Hotel-Dieu, 30 blvd.

Modulation of apoptosis is also thought to be a major component of viral persistence and progression to leukemia induced by retroviruses like human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV). Here, we analyzed the mechanism of ex vivo apoptosis occurring after isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV-infected sheep. We show that spontaneous apoptosis of ovine B lymphocytes requires at least in part a caspase 8-dependent pathway regardless of viral infection. Cell death is independent of cytotoxic response and does not involve the tumor necrosis factor alpha/NF-kappaB/nitric oxide synthase/cyclooxygenase pathway. In contrast, pharmaceutical depletion of reduced glutathione (namely, gamma-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine [GSH]) by using ethacrynic acid or 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid specifically reverts inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis conferred indirectly by protective BLV-conditioned media; inversely, exogenously provided membrane-permeable GSH-monoethyl ester restores cell viability in B lymphocytes of BLV-infected sheep. Most importantly, intracellular GSH levels correlate with virus-associated protection against apoptosis but not with general inhibition of cell death induced by polyclonal activators, such as phorbol esters and ionomycin. Finally, inhibition of apoptosis does not correlate with the activities of GSH peroxidase and GSH reductase. In summary, our data fit into a model in which modulation of the glutathione system is a key event involved in indirect inhibition of apoptosis associated with BLV. These observations could have decisive effects during therapeutic treatment of delta-retroviral pathogenesis.","['Sanchez Alcaraz, Teresa', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Reichert, Michal', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Willems, Luc']","['Sanchez Alcaraz T', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Reichert M', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Agronomy (Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, FUSAGx), 13 avenue Marechal Juin, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/physiopathology/virology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*physiology', 'Sheep Diseases']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.12.6180-6189.2004 [doi]', '78/12/6180 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jun;78(12):6180-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.12.6180-6189.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC416522,,,,,,,,,

It stimulates the cell cycle and transactivates cellular genes. Here we show that the expression of interleukin-13 (IL-13) is upregulated as a consequence of Tax in HTLV-1-transformed T cells and ATL-derived cultures. IL-13 exerts proliferative and antiapoptotic functions and is linked to leukemogenesis, since it stimulates Hodgkin lymphoma cells by an autocrine mechanism. Overexpression of IL-13 RNA and protein was confirmed in HTLV-1-positive and Tax-transformed cells. Induction of endogenous IL-13 levels in tax-transfected Jurkat cells and in conditional Tax-expressing transformed T lymphocytes suggested that Tax can replace signals required for IL-13 synthesis. For functional analysis, the IL-13 promoter and deletion variants were cloned into luciferase reporter plasmids. Experiments with transfected human T lymphocytes revealed a 16-fold stimulation of the IL-13 promoter by Tax. Experiments with Tax mutants indicated that none of the classical transactivation pathways (SRF, CREB, and NF-kappaB) is sufficient for the transactivation; at least two different Tax functions are required for full transactivation. The IL-13 promoter is stimulated via two elements; one is a NF-AT binding P element, and the other is a putative AP-1 site. The following observations suggest that IL-13 may stimulate HTLV-1-transformed cells by an autocrine mechanism: (i) the HTLV-1-transformed cells express the IL-13 receptor on their surface, and (ii) STAT6, a downstream effector of IL-13 signaling, is constitutively activated. Thus, in summary, Tax, by transactivating the promoter, induces IL-13 overexpression that possibly leads to an autocrine stimulation of HTLV-1-infected cells.","['Waldele, Katja', 'Schneider, Grit', 'Ruckes, Tobias', 'Grassmann, Ralph']","['Waldele K', 'Schneider G', 'Ruckes T', 'Grassmann R']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Schlossgarten 4, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)']",IM,"['Autocrine Communication/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells/virology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.12.6081-6090.2004 [doi]', '78/12/6081 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jun;78(12):6081-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.12.6081-6090.2004.,,,,,,,,,PMC416520,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed that the binding of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) and the activating transcription factor (ATF) to the three imperfect cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) located in each Tax(BLV)-responsive element mediates Tax(BLV) transactivation. Here we demonstrated that deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) synergistically enhanced the transcriptional activation of the BLV promoter by Tax(BLV) in a CRE-dependent manner. Tax(BLV) was acetylated in vivo at its N(alpha) terminus but not at internal lysine residues. Rather, HDACi potentiation of Tax(BLV) transactivation was mediated by an HDACi indirect action that requires new protein synthesis. Mechanistically, using a dominant-negative form of CREB, we showed that Tax(BLV) and HDACi synergistically activated BLV gene expression via a CREB-dependent mechanism. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot experiments revealed that HDACi increased the in vitro DNA binding activity of CREB/ATF but did not alter CREB/ATF intranuclear presence. Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that HDACi treatment increased the level of CREB bound to the BLV promoter in vivo. Our results together suggest that an increase in CREB/ATF occupancy of the viral CREs in response to HDACi potentiates Tax(BLV) transactivation of the BLV promoter.","['Nguyen, Thi Lien-Anh', 'Calomme, Claire', 'Wijmeersch, Gaelle', 'Nizet, Severine', 'Veithen, Emmanuelle', 'Portetelle, Daniel', 'de Launoit, Yvan', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Van Lint, Carine']","['Nguyen TL', 'Calomme C', 'Wijmeersch G', 'Nizet S', 'Veithen E', 'Portetelle D', 'de Launoit Y', 'Burny A', 'Van Lint C']","['Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires, Service de Chimie Biologique, Laboratoire de Virologie Moleculaire, Rue des Profs Jeener et Brachet 12, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomes/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/09/25 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M404081200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77344-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 13;279(33):35025-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M404081200.

However, only a few studies have focused on the extent of the amplicon or on the expression patterns of the amplified genes. We have studied six cases (five AML and one MDS) with MYC-containing dmin. Detailed fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses identified a common 4.3 Mb amplicon, with clustered proximal and distal breakpoints, harboring eight known genes (C8FW, NSE2, POU5FLC20, MYC, PVT1, AK093424, MGC27434 and MLZE). The corresponding region was deleted in one of the chromosome 8 homologues in five of the six cases, suggesting that the dmin originated through extra replication (or loop-formation)--excision--amplification. Northern blot analysis revealed that MYC was not overexpressed. Instead, the C8FW gene, encoding a phosphoprotein regulated by mitogenic pathways, displayed increased expression. These results exclude MYC as the target gene and indicate that overexpression of C8FW may be the functionally important consequence of 8q24 amplicons in AML and MDS.","['Storlazzi, Clelia T', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Strombeck, Bodil', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Ahlgren, Tomas', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Rocchi, Mariano', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Storlazzi CT', 'Fioretos T', 'Paulsson K', 'Strombeck B', 'Lassen C', 'Ahlgren T', 'Juliusson G', 'Mitelman F', 'Rocchi M', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2005/12/20 09:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/hmg/ddh164 [doi]', 'ddh164 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2004 Jul 15;13(14):1479-85. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddh164.

T cells from infected persons proliferate in response to HSV antigens in vitro and may control local relapse rather than primary infection. NK cells have been involved in the control of experimental infections. A potentially important, as yet unexplored, population of interest might be the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), which contrary to monocytes, produce very high amounts of the major antiviral molecules, type-I interferon (IFN) following interaction with HSV. OBJECTIVES: Measure type-I IFN production, PDC, and NK cells in patients with unusually severe HSV infections. STUDY DESIGN: Two female patients of 33- and 50-year-old, respectively were referred because of severe disseminated HSV2 infection and myelodysplastic marrow. One patient had leukaemia and a primary HSV2 infection whereas the other had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a chronic HSV2 infection. The following studies were performed at various time points over 18 months: analysis of the lymphocytes and PDC subsets phenotype, lymphocyte proliferation assays to recall antigens; generation of NK cells in cultures, and production of type-I IFN in serum and by HSV-infected and by sendai virus (SV)-infected blood cells. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PDC and NK cells were undetectable in the blood of both patients and NK cells could not be generated in culture at the time of ongoing infection. PBMC failed to produce IFN after infection with HSV contrasting with a normal T cell proliferation to HSV antigens in patient 1. Our observation suggests that innate immunity, through NK cells and PDC may control HSV infections, and together with IFN-producing capacity, should be investigated in patients with unusually severe HSV infections.","['Dalloul, Ali', 'Oksenhendler, Eric', 'Chosidow, Olivier', 'Ribaud, Patricia', 'Carcelain, Guylaine', 'Louvet, Sylvie', 'Massip, Patrice', 'Lebon, Pierre', 'Autran, Brigitte']","['Dalloul A', 'Oksenhendler E', 'Chosidow O', 'Ribaud P', 'Carcelain G', 'Louvet S', 'Massip P', 'Lebon P', 'Autran B']","[""Laboratoire d'Imunologie Hopital de la Pitie, Paris, France. ali.dalloul@inserm.ipsc.u-psud.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/*immunology/physiopathology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 2, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2003/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.014 [doi]', 'S1386653203003469 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2004 Aug;30(4):329-36. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The fused plasmid containing PTD gene and b3a2 bcr/abl gene of CML was constructed by genetic engineering technique and was expressed in E.coli. The PBMCs from CML patients were stimulated in-vitro with purified PTD-BCR/ABL antigen and then expression of the activation antigen CD25 on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells after stimulation was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: After stimulation with 100 mg/L of PTD-BCR/ABL antigen (final concentration) for 4 days in-vitro, CD8(+) T cells were activated in 5 of 10 CML patients and CD4(+) T cells were activated in 2 of 10 patients.

We retrospectively evaluated 44 such children ( < 7 years) conditioned with either sfTBI (n = 26) or busulphan-cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy) (n = 18), transplanted for hematological malignancies between 1988 and 2001.

This finding was more pronounced in high-risk patients with 2/10 relapses in patients with GVHD grade 2-4, compared with 13/18 relapses among those with GVHD 0-1 (p = 0.05). The probability of overall survival was 43.3% in the sfTBI group and 33.3% in the Bu-Cy group (p = 0.6).

While hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, learning problems and cataract formation were observed only in the sfTBI group, early cardiac toxicity, behavioral problems and seizures were more common in the Bu-Cy group.

Long-term morbidity in cancer survivors is exemplified by results of clinical research in testicular cancer survivors (TCSs). The most serious complication is the development of second, non-germ cell malignancies (relative risk [RR]: 1.4-1.6). After infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, most solid malignancies are diagnosed within or near the target volume. Combined chemo-radiotherapy increases this risk. Chemotherapy-induced leukaemia is usually reported after 4-7 years. After 3 or 4 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, 15-20% of TCSs suffer from peripheral sensory neuropathy, Raynaud-like phenomena and/or ototoxicity. Hypogonadism is observed in 16%. The risk of cardiac complications is increased by hypercholestorolaemia and abnormal body mass. Pelvic radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy are followed by transient oligo/azospermia with recovery after 6-12 months. The risk of surgery-related 'dry ejaculation' is significantly reduced after unilateral and nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, but infertility remains a long-term problem in 10-15% of survivors. Most TCSs describe their quality of life as comparable with that of the age-matched male general population. Not all long-term complications are avoidable after curative treatment of cancer. Knowledge of post-treatment long-term morbidity is essential for early recognition and treatment of late complications, and enables adequate counselling of new cancer patients.","['Fossa, Sophie D']",['Fossa SD'],"['Norwegian Radium Hospital, Department of Clinical Cancer Research, Montebello, Oslo, Norway. s.d.fossa@klinmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/etiology', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Raynaud Disease/etiology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy']",54,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02841860310023174 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2004;43(2):134-41. doi: 10.1080/02841860310023174.,,,,,,,,['Acta Oncol. 2004;43(2):132-3.

SWAP-70 mediates lipid second-messenger signals to the cytoskeletal-organizing GTPase Rac, functioning as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. SWAP-70 is strongly expressed in germinal center B cells, with low-level expression in resting B-cells. Expression of SWAP-70 in neoplastic B cells has not been described. We report the immunohistochemical expression of SWAP-70 in 86 B-cell neoplasms. SWAP-70 was strongly expressed in 59 of the 86 cases: 2 of 10 (20%) precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemias, 2 of 2 (100%) precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas, 2 of 4 (50%) mantle cell lymphomas, 7 of 9 (78%) Burkitt lymphomas, 9 of 9 (100%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 8 of 8 (100%) follicular lymphomas, 6 of 6 (100%) nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas, 0 of 8 (0%) classic Hodgkin lymphomas, 12 of 13 (92%) chronic lymphocytic leukemias, 3 of 3 (100%) nodal marginal zone lymphomas, 5 of 5 (100%) extranodal marginal zone lymphomas, 1 of 2 (50%) splenic marginal zone lymphomas, 2 of 3 (66%) hairy cell leukemias, and 0 of 4 (0%) plasma cell neoplasms. All 4 T-cell lymphomas were nonreactive for SWAP-70: 0 of 3 peripheral T-cell lymphomas and 0 of 1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Following paraquat exposure to L132 cells, the percentage of S-phase cells decreased significantly and the expression of p53 protein increased, suggesting that entry into S phase from G1 phase was blocked. U937 cells showed complete resistance to paraquat, although paraquat-evoked initial single-stranded DNA breaks was shown equally in either L132 or U937 cells, as assessed by single-cell gel electrophoresis. U937 and L132 cells die normally with similar kinetics when exposed to tumor necrosis factor in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that their capacity to undergo p53-independent mechanisms of inducing apoptosis has an equal rate. These results suggest that paraquat-induced DNA damage caused G1 arrest and apoptosis only in L132 cells, and that p53 protein accumulation is required for the induction of apoptosis by paraquat.","['Takeyama, Naoshi', 'Tanaka, Takaya', 'Yabuki, Teru', 'Nakatani, Toshio']","['Takeyama N', 'Tanaka T', 'Yabuki T', 'Nakatani T']","['Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan. takeyama@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Toxicol,International journal of toxicology,9708436,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects', 'Ethidium', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Herbicides/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lung/*cytology/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Paraquat/*toxicity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",,2004/05/28 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/05/28 05:00'],"['2004/05/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10915810490265432 [doi]', '19NX5EA85Y1KE87D [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Toxicol. 2004 Jan-Feb;23(1):33-40. doi: 10.1080/10915810490265432.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How F-actin is involved in regulating the activation of mast cells is unknown. In this study we investigated the role of F-actin in mast cell activation induced by aggregation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins Thy-1 and TEC-21, and compared it to activation via Fc epsilon RI. Pretreatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with latrunculin B inhibited the Thy-1-induced actin polymerization and elevated the Thy-1-mediated secretory and calcium responses. Inhibition of actin polymerization followed by Thy-1 aggregation resulted in an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma), Gab2 and linker for activation of T cells (LAT) adapters, and some other signaling molecules. Enzymatic activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PLC gamma, and phosphatase SHP-2 were also up-regulated, but tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin was inhibited. Similar changes were observed in Fc epsilon RI-activated cells. Significant changes in intracellular distribution, tyrosine phosphorylation, and/or enzymatic activities of signaling molecules occurred in latrunculin-pretreated cells before cell triggering. The combined data suggest that actin polymerization is critical for setting the thresholds for mast cell signaling via aggregation of both Fc epsilon RI and GPI-anchored proteins.","['Tolarova, Helena', 'Draberova, Lubica', 'Heneberg, Petr', 'Draber, Petr']","['Tolarova H', 'Draberova L', 'Heneberg P', 'Draber P']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (TEC-21 antigen, rat)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'LW7U308U7U (latrunculin B)']",IM,"['Actins/immunology/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Precursors/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mast Cells/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation/immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidines', 'Thy-1 Antigens/immunology', 'Type C Phospholipases/immunology']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200424991 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2004 Jun;34(6):1627-36. doi: 10.1002/eji.200424991.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloproliferative disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma can in rare cases cause infiltrative optic neuropathy. HISTORY AND SIGNS: Two patients initially presented with slowly progressive severe visual loss. History was unremarkable except for previously noted slightly elevated white blood cell count for which - according to their general physicians - no treatment or work-up was required. At presentation, bilateral disc swelling was present. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enhancement of the entire optic nerves sparing the chiasm. No other intracranial lesion was found. Cerebrospinal fluid contained no malignant cells. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: After bone marrow aspiration the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and granulocytic leukemia, respectively, was made. Treatment resulted in visual recovery. CONCLUSION: Work-up in a patient with swollen discs should always include white blood cell count. If the result is abnormal further exploration should be pursued. Elevated white blood cell count may be the only hint of optic nerve infiltration caused by a myeloproliferative disorder and its treatment can result in remarkable recovery.","['Wirth, M G', 'Bergamin, O', 'Goede, J S', 'Landau, K']","['Wirth MG', 'Bergamin O', 'Goede JS', 'Landau K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. gabriela.wirth@usz.ch']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Optic Disk/pathology', 'Optic Nerve/*pathology', 'Papilledema/*immunology/pathology', 'Vision, Low/etiology/pathology', 'Visual Acuity/physiology', 'Visual Fields/physiology']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/10/13 09:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-812857 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 2004 May;221(5):360-3. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-812857.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The improvements of therapies have increased the number of long-term survivors. However, an increased incidence of secondary neoplasias has been observed in this cohort. Our purpose was to evaluate the late effects of cancer therapy in cured patients previously treated for ALL, considering previous reports on the occurrence of gene fusions as putative markers of chromosomal instability. Twelve ALL patients (aged 5 to 16 years) and twelve healthy subjects (aged 18 to 22 years) were studied for the presence of ETV6/RUNX1 (TEL/AML1) translocations, which were detected by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). The blood samples were collected months or years after completion of the therapy, and the frequencies of gene fusions in lymphocytes were compared with those obtained retrospectively for bone marrow samples at the time of diagnosis, and also for the control group. It was demonstrated that ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion was a frequent event (0.59-1.84/100 cells) in peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals and the ALL patients who underwent chemotherapy showed significantly (P = 0.0043) increased frequencies (0.62-3.96/100 cells) of the rearrangement when compared with the control groups (patients at diagnosis and healthy subjects). However, a significant difference was not found between the groups of patients at diagnosis and healthy subjects, when the two patients who were positive for the rearrangement were excluded. Therefore, increased frequencies of ETV6/RUNX1 fusions in ALL cured patients indicate the influence of previous exposure to anti-cancer drugs, and they may represent an important genetic marker for estimating the risk of relapse, or development of secondary neoplasias.","['Brassesco, M S', 'Camparoto, M L', 'Tone, L G', 'Sakamoto-Hojo, E T']","['Brassesco MS', 'Camparoto ML', 'Tone LG', 'Sakamoto-Hojo ET']","['Departamento de Genetica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto-USP, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured/ultrastructure', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/genetics', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/blood/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2003/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000077514 [doi]', '77514 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2004;104(1-4):346-51. doi: 10.1159/000077514.,,"['Copyright 2003 S.

The sumoylation reaction is catalyzed by the SUMO protease, which exposes the C-terminal active glycine residue of the nascent SUMO, the heterodimeric SUMO activating enzyme, the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, and SUMO protein ligases, in a manner similar to ubiquitinylation. Identification of SUMO-regulated proteins is hampered by the fact that many sumoylated proteins are present at a level below normal detection limit. This limitation was overcome by either in vivo overexpression of Myc-SUMO or in vitro sumoylation with excess biotin-SUMO and Ubc9. Sumoylated proteins so obtained were affinity purified or isolated by immunoprecipitation. The isolated sumoylated proteins were identified by sequence analysis using mass spectrometric methods. Results reveal that several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), zinc finger proteins, and nuclear pore complex proteins were sumoylated. The sumoylation of hnRNP A1, hnRNP F, and hnRNP K were confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. In view of the facts that hnRNPs have been implicated in RNA splicing, transport, stability, and translation, our findings suggest that sumoylation could play an important role in regulating mRNA metabolism.","['Li, Tianwei', 'Evdokimov, Evgenij', 'Shen, Rong-Fong', 'Chao, Chien-Chung', 'Tekle, Ephrem', 'Wang, Tao', 'Stadtman, Earl R', 'Yang, David C H', 'Chock, P Boon']","['Li T', 'Evdokimov E', 'Shen RF', 'Chao CC', 'Tekle E', 'Wang T', 'Stadtman ER', 'Yang DC', 'Chock PB']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-8012, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteomics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0402889101 [doi]', '0402889101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jun 8;101(23):8551-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0402889101.

Thus, a major goal in chemotherapy is to find cytotoxic agents that restore the ability of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. We previously found that an Ent-kaurene diterpene, Ent-11alpha-hydroxy-16-kauren-15-one (KD), induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Here, we found that caspase-8, an apoptotic factor, is involved in KD-induced apoptosis. Although treatment of HL-60 cells with KD resulted in the activation of caspase-8 and -9, a caspase-8-specific inhibitor but not a caspase-9-specific inhibitor attenuated KD-induced apoptosis. Expression of a catalytically inactive caspase-8 partly attenuated KD-induced apoptosis. Treatment with KD led to a time-dependent cleavage of Bid, a substrate of caspase-8, as well as to the proteolytic processing of procaspase-8, indicating that KD treatment induces apoptosis through a caspase-8-dependent pathway. Moreover, overexpression of the drug resistance factor Bcl-2, which is frequently overexpressed in many tumors, failed to confer resistance to KD-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, KD may be a promising experimental cytotoxic agent that possibly points to new strategies to overcome a drug resistance.","['Kondoh, Masuo', 'Suzuki, Ikue', 'Sato, Masao', 'Nagashima, Fumihiro', 'Simizu, Siro', 'Harada, Motoki', 'Fujii, Makiko', 'Osada, Hiroyuki', 'Asakawa, Yoshinori', 'Watanabe, Yoshiteru']","['Kondoh M', 'Suzuki I', 'Sato M', 'Nagashima F', 'Simizu S', 'Harada M', 'Fujii M', 'Osada H', 'Asakawa Y', 'Watanabe Y']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Showa Pharmaceutical University, Machida, Tokyo, 194-8543, Japan. masuo@ac.shoyaku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '34424-57-2 (kaurene)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/jpet.104.069690 [doi]', 'jpet.104.069690 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2004 Oct;311(1):115-22. doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.069690.

MJ202-72F3, to induce apoptosis in the L1210 cell line. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that IC101 caused a concentration-dependent cell death with a 50% effective concentration value of 20 nM. Cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, a typical DNA ladder pattern, and up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 expression, which were biochemical characteristics of apoptosis, were induced by IC101. It also was observed that IC101 caused a concentration-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and Bad without affecting phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, an upstream molecule of Akt. IC101 dephosphorylated the 90-kDa protein, as assayed by immunblotting of the cell extract by using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To identify the 90-kDa protein, immunoprecipitation and direct nano-flow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were performed to demonstrate that this protein was heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Consistently, it was observed that IC101 induced the HSP90 tyrosine dephosphorylation by immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates with anti-HSP90 antibody using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. IC101 caused the degradation of Raf-1, which formed a complex with HSP90. The HSP90-ATP binding also was inhibited by IC101 in a noncompetitive manner. An interaction of HSP90 with Akt was shown to be inhibited by IC101 in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that IC101 dephosphorylates Akt through an inhibition of HSP90 functions, resulting in the interaction with Akt to induce apoptotic cell death of L1210 cells.","['Fujiwara, Hironori', 'Yamakuni, Tohru', 'Ueno, Mitsuhiro', 'Ishizuka, Masaaki', 'Shinkawa, Takashi', 'Isobe, Toshiaki', 'Ohizumi, Yasushi']","['Fujiwara H', 'Yamakuni T', 'Ueno M', 'Ishizuka M', 'Shinkawa T', 'Isobe T', 'Ohizumi Y']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8578, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '154272-92-1 (IC 101)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/jpet.104.065979 [doi]', 'jpet.104.065979 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2004 Sep;310(3):1288-95. doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.065979.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multidisciplinary team approach and protocol-based therapy on the event-free survival of children with ALL in an area with limited resources. DESIGN, POPULATION, AND SETTING: A retrospective cohort study at a pediatric hospital in the resource-poor city of Recife, Brazil. We reviewed medical records of the outcomes of 375 children with ALL diagnosed between 1980 and 2002. Eighty-three children were diagnosed in the early period (1980-1989), in the absence of a dedicated pediatric oncology unit, protocol-based therapy, specially trained nurses, 24-hour on-site physician coverage, and ready access to intensive care. Seventy-eight children were treated (all according to protocol) during the middle period (July 1994 to March 1997). During the recent period (April 1997 to December 2002), 214 children were treated with protocol in a dedicated pediatric oncology unit staffed 24 hours by pediatric oncologists and oncology nurses. Improvements were implemented gradually during the middle period and were completed during the recent period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Event-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Events included death from toxicity, disease progression or relapse, and abandonment of treatment. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival improved steadily: 32% (95% CI, 21%-43%) in the early period, 47% (95% CI, 36%-58%) in the middle period, and 63% (95% CI, 55%-71%) in the recent period. The probability of cause-specific treatment failure in the early, middle, and late periods, respectively, within 1 year of diagnosis was 14% vs 3.8% vs 3.3% for relapse; 6.0% vs 12% vs 9.8% for death from infection; 2.4% vs 13% vs 4.2% for death from noninfectious toxicity; and 16% vs 1.3% vs 0.5% for abandonment of therapy.

We performed a Phase I study to investigate the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of bortezomib in patients with acute leukemias refractory to or relapsing after prior therapy. Fifteen patients were treated with 0.75 (n = 3), 1.25 (n = 7), or 1.5 (n = 5) mg/m(2) bortezomib administered twice weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity included orthostatic hypotension (n = 2), nausea (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 1), and fluid retention (n = 1), all at 1.5 mg/m(2) bortezomib. Proteasome inhibition was dose dependent and reached 68% at 1.5 mg/m(2) bortezomib. Peak inhibition was observed 1 h after treatment and returned to near baseline levels by 72 h after treatment. Incubation of blast cells with bortezomib in vitro showed induction of apoptosis in three of five patients investigated. We conclude that the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in patients with acute leukemia is 1.25 mg/m(2), using a twice-weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks schedule. The in vitro evidence of antileukemia and transient hematological improvements observed in some patients warrants further investigation of bortezomib in acute leukemias, probably in combination with other agents.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Koller, Charles', 'Giles, Francis', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'McConkey, David', 'Ruiz, Stacey L', 'Guerciolini, Roberto', 'Wright, John', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Koller C', 'Giles F', 'Estey E', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'McConkey D', 'Ruiz SL', 'Guerciolini R', 'Wright J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

We hypothesized that gene expression profiling could also be used to identify differential activation of healthy and malignant cells, and as a model for this, we examined the molecular sequelae of CD40 activation of healthy and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression signatures grouped samples by CD40 activation status and further subclassified CD40-activated CLL cells from healthy B cells. Supervised analyses in healthy B cells compared to CLL cells identified differential regulation of genes governing cell cycle progression and apoptosis. CD40 signaling of CLL cells increases their susceptibility to immune recognition, but promotes survival and cell cycle arrest, making these cells potentially more resistant to chemotherapy. These results illustrate the utility of gene expression profiling to elucidate the molecular sequelae of signaling in healthy cells and altered signaling pathways in malignant cells. This type of approach should be useful to identify targets of therapy of malignant diseases.","['Gricks, Clair S', 'Zahrieh, David', 'Zauls, A Jason', 'Gorgun, Gullu', 'Drandi, Daniela', 'Mauerer, Katja', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Gribben, John G']","['Gricks CS', 'Zahrieh D', 'Zauls AJ', 'Gorgun G', 'Drandi D', 'Mauerer K', 'Neuberg D', 'Gribben JG']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney St, Rm D520, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reference Values']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-02-0494 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)49042-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Dec 15;104(13):4002-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-02-0494.

Blocking these acute cholesterol responses selectively sensitizes AML cells to therapeutics. Thus, defining the molecular mechanisms by which AML cells accomplish these protective cholesterol increments might elucidate novel therapeutic targets. We now report that the levels of mRNAs encoding the cholesterol synthesis-regulating enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and the cholesterol-importing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were both increased by daunorubicin (DNR) or cytarabine (ARA-C) treatments in almost three fourths of cultured AML samples. However, less than one third of AML samples significantly increased LDL accumulation during drug treatments, suggesting that de novo synthesis is the primary mechanism by which most AML cells increase cholesterol levels during drug exposures. LDL increments were not correlated with cholesterol increments in ARA-C-treated AML samples. However, LDL and cholesterol increments did correlate in DNR-treated AML samples where they were measured, suggesting that a subset of AMLs may rely on increased LDL accumulation during treatment with particular drugs. Our data suggest that cholesterol synthesis inhibitors may improve the efficacy of standard antileukemia regimens, but that for maximum benefit, therapy may need to be tailored for individual patients with leukemia.","['Banker, Deborah E', 'Mayer, Sasha J', 'Li, Henry Y', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Zager, Richard A']","['Banker DE', 'Mayer SJ', 'Li HY', 'Willman CL', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Zager RA']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. dbanker@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1UQM1K0W9X (mevastatin)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.3.3.10 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase)', 'EC 6.2.1.- (Coenzyme A Ligases)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cholesterol, LDL/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Coenzyme A Ligases/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lovastatin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/10/07 09:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0395 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43429-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 15;104(6):1816-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0395.

However, the spectrum of malignancies sharing common genetic factors with CLL and the effects of sex and age on familial risk are unknown. We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to test for increased familial risks of CLL and other lymphoproliferative tumors. Cancer diagnoses from 1958 to 1998 were assessed in 14 336 first-degree relatives of 5918 CLL cases and in 28 876 first-degree relatives of 11 778 controls. Cancer risks in relatives of cases were compared with those in relatives of controls using marginal survival models. Relatives of cases were at significantly increased risk for CLL (relative risk [RR] = 7.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.63-15.56), for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 1.45; 95% CI, 0.98-2.16), and for Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.08-5.08). CLL risks were similar in parents, siblings, and offspring of cases, in male and female relatives, and were not affected by the case's age at diagnosis. Anticipation was not significant when analyzed using life table methods. We conclude that the familial component of CLL is shared with other lymphoproliferative malignances, suggesting common genetic pathways.

DTU2GMCSF was highly toxic to the TF1-vRaf AML cell line (proliferation inhibition assay; IC50 = 3.14 pM), and this toxicity was greatly inhibited following pretreatment with anti-uPA and anti-GM-CSF antibodies. The activity of this toxin was then tested on a larger group of 13 human AML cell lines; 5 of the 13 cell lines were sensitive to DTU2GMCSF. An additional 5 of the 13 cell lines became sensitive when exogenous pro-uPA was added. Sensitivity to DTU2GMCSF strongly correlated with the expression levels of uPA receptors (uPARs) and GM-CSF receptors (GM-CSFRs) as well as with total uPA levels. DTU2GMCSF was less toxic to normal cells expressing uPAR or GMCSFR alone, that is, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and peripheral macrophages, respectively.

Daxx co-localizes with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and regulates transcription. Human Daxx (hDaxx) is a protein that functions as a transcriptional regulation through its interaction with some DNA-associated proteins. The aim of this study was to explore the transcriptional regulatory effect of hDaxx interacting with adenovirus (Ad) 12 E1B (Ad12E1B) 55-kDa oncoprotein. METHODS: The co-localization of hDaxx-Ad12E1B or hDaxx-PML protein in the nucleus was observed under a confocal microscope. Interaction of hDaxx and Ad12E1B was analyzed by yeast two-hybrid assay. Direct binding of hDaxx and Ad12E1B was analyzed using coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot in vivo and in vitro. The activity of a luciferase reporter gene, which was regulated by an hDaxx modulated thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, was detected in an automat luminometer. RESULTS: Ad12E1B, which co-localized with hDaxx in the nuclei of G401-CC3 cells, disrupted the co-localization of hDaxx and PML in the PML oncogenic domains (PODs). hDaxx bound directly to Ad12E1B in vivo and in vitro. hDaxx interacted with Ad12E1B along its full length. Ad12E1B enhanced transcriptional repression activity of hDaxx. CONCLUSION: Ad12E1B disrupts the co-localization of hDaxx with PML in PODs and enhances transcriptional repression activity of hDaxx.","['Wan, Yan-ping', 'Wu, Yi-mou', 'Zhu, Cui-ming', 'Yin, Wei-guo', 'Cai, Heng-ling', 'Yu, Min-jun']","['Wan YP', 'Wu YM', 'Zhu CM', 'Yin WG', 'Cai HL', 'Yu MJ']","['Institute of Pathogenic Biology, Nanhua University, Hengyang 421001, China. yanpingwan@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 May;117(5):753-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological studies on adult T-cell leukemia patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation also suggest that Tax-targeted immunotherapy may be effective against full-blown disease, although its indication may be limited.","['Kannagi, Mari', 'Harashima, Nanae', 'Kurihara, Kiyoshi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Masuda, Masato']","['Kannagi M', 'Harashima N', 'Kurihara K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Tanosaki R', 'Masuda M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, okyo Medical and Dental University, Medical Research Division, Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan. kann.impt@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/therapy', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use']",63,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['ERA040305 [pii]', '10.1586/14737140.4.3.369 [doi]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2004 Jun;4(3):369-76. doi: 10.1586/14737140.4.3.369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The products of these oncogenes, including BCR-ABL, TEL-PDGFR, Flt3 and c-Kit, have elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transform haematopoietic cells, mainly by augmentation of proliferation and enhanced viability. Activated ABL kinases are associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Mutations in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta are associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Flt3 or c-Kit cooperate with other types of oncogenes to create fully transformed acute leukaemias. Elevated activity of these tyrosine kinases is crucial for transformation, thus making the kinase domain an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors for various kinases are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and are potentially useful therapeutic agents in myeloid leukaemias.

This paper presents results based on a cohort of 45,468 nuclear power industry workers from the Canadian National Dose Registry monitored for more than 1 year for chronic low-dose whole-body ionizing radiation exposures sometime between 1957 and 1994 (mean duration of monitoring = 7.4 years, mean cumulative equivalent dose = 13.5 mSv). The excess relative risks for leukemia [excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)] and for all solid cancers were 52.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.205, 291] and 2.80 (95% CI: -0.038, 7.13) per sievert, respectively, both associations having P values close to 0.05. Relative risks by dose categories increased monotonically for leukemia excluding CLL but were less consistent for all solid cancers combined. Although the point estimates are higher than those found in other studies of whole-body irradiation, the difference could well be due to chance. Further follow-up of this cohort or the combination of results from multiple worker studies will produce more stable estimates and thus complement the risk estimates from higher-dose studies.","['Zablotska, Lydia B', 'Ashmore, J Patrick', 'Howe, Geoffrey R']","['Zablotska LB', 'Ashmore JP', 'Howe GR']","['Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA. lbz7@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Power Plants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['RR3170 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3170 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2004 Jun;161(6):633-41. doi: 10.1667/rr3170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with newly diagnosed and previously untreated (apart from hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide) CML in the chronic phase, imatinib mesylate 400 mg/day, compared with interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) plus cytarabine, resulted in higher hematologic response (HR) and cytogenetic response (CR) rates and fewer patients progressing to the accelerated phase or blast crisis in a large comparative trial. Preliminary results indicate that, compared with IFNalpha plus cytarabine, imatinib mesylate treatment was associated with similar total costs, but resulted in a higher health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Imatinib mesylate was also effective in patients with chronic-phase CML refractory to or intolerant of treatment with IFNalpha (as 400 mg/day) and in those with blast-crisis or accelerated-phase CML (600 mg/day). In the latter groups, HR and CR rates were lower than those in patients with chronic-phase CML. Imatinib mesylate-associated adverse events were common in clinical trials, but were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The most frequently reported adverse events were superficial edema, nausea, muscle cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, and skin rash. Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was also reported, especially in patients with advanced disease. In patients with previously untreated chronic-phase CML, serious adverse events (both hematologic and nonhematologic) were less common with imatinib mesylate than with IFNalpha plus cytarabine treatment. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate is a valuable therapy for patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ chronic-phase CML. It is better tolerated and produces higher HR, CR and freedom from progressive disease rates than conventional therapy with IFNalpha plus cytarabine. Preliminary results indicate that, compared with IFNalpha plus cytarabine, imatinib mesylate treatment was associated with similar total costs, but resulted in a higher HR-QOL. Imatinib mesylate is also effective in patients with accelerated-phase and blast-crisis CML, and patients with chronic-phase CML who have failed IFNalpha therapy. Given its efficacy and generally manageable adverse event profile, imatinib mesylate offers an important early treatment option for patients with CML.","['Curran, Monique P', 'Croom, Katherine F', 'Goa, Karen L']","['Curran MP', 'Croom KF', 'Goa KL']","['Adis International Inc., Yardley, Pennsylvania 19067, USA. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",27,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/08/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['1839 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-200418030-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2004;18(3):207-10. doi: 10.2165/00063030-200418030-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Important pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as activating protein-1 and nuclear factor kappaB, which are activated in airway disease, require kinase activation to switch on inflammatory genes, while other kinases can regulate mRNA half-life. Selective kinase inhibitors have been developed that reduce inflammatory gene expression and some characteristics of disease in animal models. Targeting specific kinases that are overexpressed or overactive in disease should allow for selective treatment of airway inflammatory diseases. Interest in this area has intensified due to the success of the specific Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Encouraging data from animal models and primary cells and early phase I and II studies in other diseases suggest that inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibitor of kappaB kinase-2 may prove to be useful novel therapies in the treatment of severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","['Adcock, Ian M', 'Caramori, Gaetano']","['Adcock IM', 'Caramori G']","['Department of Thoracic Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK. ian.adcock@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*drug therapy/enzymology']",100,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/08/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['1833 [pii]', '10.2165/00063030-200418030-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2004;18(3):167-80. doi: 10.2165/00063030-200418030-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expected rate for the population is about one case every five years. In 2001, 99 domestic and municipal wells and one industrial well were sampled in the Fallon area. Twenty-nine of these wells had been sampled previously in 1989. Statistical comparison of concentrations of major ions and trace elements in those 29 wells between 1989 and 2001 using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicate water quality did not substantially change over that period; however, short-term changes may have occurred that were not detected. Volatile organic compounds were seldom detected in ground water samples and those that are regulated were consistently found at concentrations less than the maximum contaminant level (MCL). The MCL for gross-alpha radioactivity and arsenic, radon, and uranium concentrations were commonly exceeded, and sometimes were greatly exceeded. Statistical comparisons using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicate gross-alpha and -beta radioactivity, arsenic, uranium, and radon concentrations in wells used by families having a child with leukemia did not statistically differ from the remainder of the domestic wells sampled during this investigation. Isotopic measurements indicate the uranium was natural and not the result of a 1963 underground nuclear bomb test near Fallon. In arid and semiarid areas where trace-element concentrations can greatly exceed the MCL, household reverse-osmosis units may not reduce their concentrations to safe levels. In parts of the world where radon concentrations are high, water consumed first thing in the morning may be appreciably more radioactive than water consumed a few minutes later after the pressure tank has been emptied because secular equilibrium between radon and its immediate daughter progeny is attained in pressure tanks overnight.","['Seiler, Ralph L']",['Seiler RL'],"['U.S. Geological Survey, 333 W.

The route of synthesis and DNA-binding properties of the compounds were reported previously. This paper describes the general structure-activity relationships for the class of imidazothioxanthones in panels of human and murine tumor cell lines in vitro, and the in vivo activity against human and murine solid tumors of the most potent compound, N-[3-(Dimethylamino)propylo]-11-oxo-11H-benzothiopyrano [3',2':2,3]pyrido[1,2-a]imidazo-2-carboxamide (10a). In addition, the interaction between compound 10a and DNA is also considered in terms of molecular mechanics methods and flexible docking techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of compounds 10a, 11-oxo-N-[2-(pyrrolidino)ethylo]-11H-benzothiopyrano [3',2':2,3]pyrido[1,2-a]imidazo-2-carboxamide, 11-oxo-N-[2-(piperidino)ethylo]-11H-benzothiopyrano [3',2':2,3]pyrido[1,2-a]imidazo-2-carboxamide and N-[2-(morpholino)ethylo]-11-oxo-11H-benzothiopyrano [3',2':2,3]pyrido[1,2-a]imidazo-2-carboxamide (10c-10e) was assessed in human tumor cell lines and xenografts using the sulforhodamine B assay, MTT assay and the clonogenic assay. The human ovarian xenograft, PXN/109TC, two human breast carcinomas, MT-1 and MCF-7, and the murine colon adenocarcinoma, MAC15A were used for the in vivo testing of compound 10a. In addition, the interaction between compound 10a and DNA is also considered in terms of molecular mechanics methods and flexible docking techniques. RESULTS: Two compounds, 10a and 10c, showed cytotoxic activity below 10 mM in the NCI in vitro screen of 60 human tumor cell lines. The IC50 value of compound 10a was 6.8 mM and that of 10c, 8.3 mM. In addition, both compounds possessed differential activity against leukemia, colon and mammary cancer. The activity pattern was confirmed in two further screens using monolayer and clonogenic, assays. In vivo antitumor studies showed that 10a was active against the human mammary carcinoma MT-1 and murine colon cancer MAC15A. Marginal activity was observed in human ovarian cancer model PXN/109T/C and the compound was inactive in human mammary cancer MCF-7. CONCLUSION: The results warrant further in vivo testing of 10a in additional human solid tumor models. The molecular modeling showed that the planarity of the chromophore and the side-chain conformation could assist the insertion of compound 10a between the base pairs of the double helix. On the other hand, docking to the nucleotide sequence GGAATTGCCTCA suggested that the molecule could also act as a minor groove binder.","['Varvaresou, A', 'Iakovou, K', 'Gikas, E', 'Fichtner, I', 'Fiebig, H H', 'Kelland, L R', 'Double, J A', 'Bibby, M C', 'Hendriks, H R']","['Varvaresou A', 'Iakovou K', 'Gikas E', 'Fichtner I', 'Fiebig HH', 'Kelland LR', 'Double JA', 'Bibby MC', 'Hendriks HR']","['EORTC New Drug Development Office, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. varvaresou@pharm.uoa.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Xanthones)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Xanthones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Mar-Apr;24(2B):907-19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deferiprone (HK1), which showed the highest tumor specificity, had 10 times higher cytotoxicity than maltol (HK3) in both human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-2 cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of HK1 against HL-60 and HSC-2 cells was reduced in the presence of FeCl3, while that of HK3 was significantly increased by FeCl3. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that HK1 induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells, but the addition of FeCl3 inhibited the DNA fragmentation. HK3 did not induce DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells, regardless of the presence or absence of FeCl3. In HSC-2 cells, HK1 and 3 did not induce DNA fragmentation in the presence or absence of FeCl3. Colorimetric protease assay showed that HK1 activated the caspase 3, 8 and 9 in HL-60 cells.

The cytotoxicities of the unsaturated lactones were moderately tumor-specific (SI = 1.5-1.9). Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the induction of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in human promyelocytic leukemia cell HL-60 is dependent on the structure of alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Fluorometric protease assay showed that some, but not all compounds, activated the caspase 3 in a dose-dependent manner. All alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds studied did not activate caspases 8 and 9.

The Lung Resistance-related Protein (LRP) is a protein associated with drug resistance, which is involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and is known to predict a poor response to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukaemia. The only method allowing the detection of LRP activity is based on radio-labelled daunorubicin incorporation. Our goal was to develop a fluorescence-based assay to analyse LRP function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used human colon carcinoma cell lines treated with sodium butyrate (NaB) in order to induce LRP expression. Daunorubicin efflux in isolated nuclei was measured by flow cytometry, the localization and quantification of Daunorubicin analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the diffusion coefficient of this drug estimated by Fluorescence Correlation Spectrometry (FCS). RESULTS: According to the method using [14C] Doxorubicin cells incubated with NaB displayed an efflux of Daunorubicin out of isolated nuclei demonstrated by flow cytometry or CLSM. The FCS method was able to evaluate kinetics of Daunorubicin molecules in nucleus and cytoplasm and showed a higher dispersion of Daunorubicin kinetics with cells previously NaB-treated. This argument is in favour of an increase of nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange. CONCLUSION: Using CLSM we showed that LRP was able to modify anticancer drug repartition in the cells. LRP activity assessment needs either isolated nuclei if flow cytometry is employed, or FCS, and only a few cells may be analysed.","['Durdux, M', 'Grunwald, D', 'Gautier, T', 'Ronot, X', 'Boutonnat, J']","['Durdux M', 'Grunwald D', 'Gautier T', 'Ronot X', 'Boutonnat J']","[""Laboratoire de Dynamique Cellulaire, EPHE, UMR CNRS 5525, Institut d'Ingenierie et de l'Information de Sante, IFRT 130 F-38706 La Tronche cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Butyrates/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/chemistry/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analysis', 'Fibrosarcoma/chemistry/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2004 Mar-Apr;24(2B):725-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four months after radiation therapy, he had full-blown acute myeloid leukemia. He received 2 cycles of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), allopurinol and hydroxyurea. Three months after initiation of chemotherapy, he deteriorated and received salvage chemotherapy of prednisone, VP-16 and imatinib mesylate (Gleevec).

A population of 10 to 20 million worldwide is estimated to be infected by the virus, but only 1-4% develop ATLL during a 70-year lifespan. The latency period is more than 30 years. The aim of this study was to report two cases of ATLL in Greek patients with the concomitant study of their family members. A 55-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man presented with leucocytosis and lymphocytosis. Both were asymptomatic and physical examination was unremarkable except for minimal lymphadenopathy in the second patient. In both patients blood smears showed small-to-medium-sized, multilobulated lymphocytes, with different degrees of nuclear irregularity. Immunophenotypic study was as follows: CD2 + (97%), CD3 + (95%), CD5 + (95%), CD3/CD4 + (93%), CD3/CD25 + (84%), CD7 -/CD4 + (89%) CD2 + /HLA-DR + (53%), TCRabeta + (96%) and CD7-(7%). Bone marrow biopsy revealed a normal cellularity with dyserythropoiesis and scattered small lymphocytes (CD4 + on immunostaining) Serum HTLV I and II antibodies were positive. T-cell receptor gamma-chain rearrangement was positive in blood lymphocytes by PCR. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex karyotypic abnormalities. DNA analysis by PCR demonstrated the integration of the HTLV-I DNA in the DNA of the neoplastic T cells. Both patients rapidly developed acute type ATLL. In the first patient multiple subcutaneous nodules on the palmar surface of both hands were also observed. She received deoxycoformycin, which was stopped because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Corticosteroid treatment was initiated, with gradual improvement. She suffered from recurrent opportunistic infections. She is currently under interferon and zidovudine therapy with stable blood parameters. Chemotherapy was administered to the other patient with > 50% initial response. Both patients' families were tested for serum anti HTLV-I antibodies and their mates were found to be positive; they also had detectable viral DNA by PCR analysis while asymptomatic, with no abnormal clinical findings and normal white blood cell count and morphology.

To evaluate its toxicity and efficacy in a combination regimen with cytarabine, we conducted a clinical phase I/II trial in patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or relapsed or newly diagnosed MDS RAEB, RAEB-t or CMML. Twenty-one patients (11 AML, 10 MDS/CMML) entered the study and were treated with 1.25 mg/m2 topotecan as continuous intravenous infusion daily for 5 days and cytarabine 1.0 g/m2 by infusion over 2 h daily for 5 days (TA).

In 1 patient, the dose of TA had to be reduced and in 1 patient, there was a treatment delay for the second cycle, both because of hematologic toxicity. The most frequent non-hematologic side-effect of TA was fever, which occurred in 17 patients (89%) with temperatures over 38 degrees C. None of the patients died due to any treatment-related toxicities, but 2 patients (10%) died within 1 month due to disease progression. A CR was achieved in 7 patients (33%), 3 of whom were MDS and 4 AML.

Therefore, controversy and discussion continues as to whether APMF may be considered as a hyperfibrotic (de novo) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or as a severe toxic myelopathy with accompanying myelofibrosis. In this context scant knowledge exists about BM findings, but especially evolution of this disorder according to sequential examinations. Clinically patients present with pancytopenia, a very few blasts in the peripheral blood and no or little splenomegaly. Initially BM histopathology is characterized by different degrees of reticulin-collagen fibrosis and wide ranges of cellularity with a prominent left-shifted and often macrocytic erythropoiesis associated with a reduction and maturation defects of the neutrophil series. Most conspicuous are abnormalities of the megakaryocytes including loose clustering, dislocation towards the endosteal border and appearance of atypical microforms with compact nuclei. Moreover, besides myelofibrosis in a number of patients the interstitial compartment displays a remarkable inflammatory reaction with lymphoid nodules, abundant iron-laden macrophages, perivascular plasmacytosis and increase in microvessels. Repeatedly performed BM biopsies reveal an accumulation of dispersed or clustered CD34+ and lysozyme-expressing blasts in keeping with the insidious transformation into acute leukemia. Prognosis is unfavorable with a median survival of less than 1 year. In conclusion, APMF has to be regarded as a condition that shows considerable overlappings with primary hyperfibrotic MDS, AML and toxic myelopathy (secondary MDS) with accompanying myelofibrosis and therefore can not be considered as a definite clinical entity.","['Thiele, Juergen', 'Kvasnicka, Hans M', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Schmitt-Graeff A']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*pathology']",74,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001625692 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Apr;45(4):681-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001625692.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Ph + ALL, responses to STI571 are not sustained, and in the overwhelming majority of patients development of resistance is rapid. Clinically, two types of resistance to STI571 can be distinguished: 'primary resistance', corresponding to a failure to achieve fewer than 5% blasts in the bone marrow, and 'secondary resistance' in patients with STI571-induced complete remission who relapse despite continued STI571 treatment. Attempts to identify mechanisms by which Ph + ALL acquire resistance to STI571 have already been successful. Mutations in the ATP binding site of ABL are frequent events which counteract the antileukemic effect of STI571. Gene expression profiling has been shown to discriminate between resistant and sensitive leukemic cells. Application of this technique has also generated several hypotheses regarding the ability of leukemic cells to bypass the BCR-ABL signal transduction pathway.

The role of BCRP in the physiology of hematopoietic stem cells is addressed as well as the involvement of BCRP in multidrug resistance in acute leukemia.

Nearly all de novo APL patients undergo disease remission when treated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus chemotherapy. APL patients that relapse following this type of therapy respond to As2O3 with disease remission once again. The mechanism of action of both ATRA and As2O3 appears to be by inducing granulocytic differentiation and this cellular differentiation seems to depend on PML-RARalpha proteolysis. ATRA treatment results in partial cleavage and complete degradation of PML-RARalpha protein in differentiation sensitive, but not in differentiation resistant APL cells. As2O3 treatment results in only complete degradation of PML-RARalpha protein in both ATRA-sensitive and -resistant APL cells. PML-RARalpha appears to cause leukemia by acting as a transcriptional repressor of RARalpha target genes and by inhibiting activity of transcription factor C/EBPalpha. Therefore, PML-RARalpha proteolysis induced by ATRA and As2O3 may play an important role in overcoming the repressive activity of PML-RARalpha and allowing cellular differentiation to proceed.

We investigated the effect of TEPA on the CD34/CD38 surface antigen expression of human myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as normal cord blood derived hematopoietic cells. Confirming previous results, our data showed that both the leukemic and normal cells increased their CD38 expression when grown in serum-containing medium or when treated with retinoic acid. In the present study, we found that TEPA inhibited CD38 under these conditions in both normal and leukemic cells. As for CD34, TEPA increased the proportion of CD34 cells in short- and long-term normal cultures but not in the leukemic cell lines.

It was our aim to find out whether MLL mutant (MLLmu) and MLL wild-type (MLLwt) acute leukemia-derived cell lines might likewise be discriminated on the basis of HOX gene expression. Southern blot analysis, performed to verify the MLL status of the cells, showed that NOMO-1 was the only cell line not tested previously carrying a rearranged MLL gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that this cell line exhibited a reciprocal t(9;11)(q23;p22). Sequencing of RT-PCR products thereof identified unique MLL exon 10/AF-9 exon 5 fusion transcripts. We divided the acute leukemia-derived cell lines (n = 37) according to the results of Southern blot analysis into MLLmu (n = 19) and MLLwt (n = 18). Expression of HOX genes was then analyzed by applying reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern and Western blot analyses. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines expressed the HOX genes significantly more often than acute lymphoblastic (ALL) cell lines. In ALL, cells with MLL translocations expressed the genes 4 times more often than MLLwt cells. Most distinct was the correlation between MLL status and MEIS1 expression in ALL-derived cell lines: 8/8 MLLmu but 0/10 MLLwt cell lines expressed MEIS1. Northern and Western blot analysis confirmed that also HOXA9 and FLT3 were significantly more often and stronger expressed in MLLmu than in MLLwt ALL cell lines. These results suggest that MLL aberrations may regulate MEIS1 and HOXA9 gene expression in ALL-derived cell lines, while AML-derived cell lines express these genes independently of the MLL status.","['Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Dirks, Wilhelm G', 'Macleod, Roderick A F', 'Reinhardt, Julia', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Dirks WG', 'Macleod RA', 'Reinhardt J', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ--German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001609942 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Mar;45(3):567-74. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001609942.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the anterior mediastinum is a frequent site of involvement by both primary and secondary lymphoma/leukemia, flow cytometry plays an important role in the evaluation of mediastinal masses. The present study reviews 100 flow cytometry cases from patients presenting with mediastinal lesions. In 5 cases (5%) flow cytometry was not diagnostic due to either insufficient cell yield or low viability. In the remaining cases (95/100) cell suspensions were adequate for flow cytometry evaluation. Results showed that in 31/32 (96.8%), 2/3 (66.7%), 7/9 (77.8%), 7/8 (87.5%) and 11/11 (100%) cases of B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, carcinoma, T-ALL/LBL and thymoma/thymic hyperplasia, respectively, the diagnosis could be reached by flow cytometry alone. Excluding HL, the general sensitivity of FC in diagnosing mediastinal tumors was approximately 92%. Among the 100 cases, flow cytometry gave non-informative results in 3 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 case of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and 3 cases of carcinoma. No false positive results were encountered. The phenotypic pattern, especially surface CD3 expression versus forward scatter, reliably discriminated between immature thymocytes from thymoma/thymic hyperplasia from T-ALL/LBL. Flow methodology has the advantage of rapid turn-around time as well as high sensitivity, enabling patients with large anterior mediastinal masses and/or superior vena cava syndrome to begin treatment as promptly as possible. In experienced hands, flow cytometry plays a valuable and complementary role to histology and immunohistochemistry in diagnosing mediastinal tumors.","['Gorczyca, Wojciech', 'Tugulea, Sorina', 'Liu, Zach', 'Li, Xiaoyu', 'Wong, John Y L', 'Weisberger, James']","['Gorczyca W', 'Tugulea S', 'Liu Z', 'Li X', 'Wong JY', 'Weisberger J']","['Division of Hematopathology, IMPATH Inc., 521 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019, USA. wojciech.gorczyca@IMPATH.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001598008 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Mar;45(3):529-38. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001598008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrations involving 8q24 were found at diagnosis (n = 66) or at relapse/progression (n = 21). Histologically, Burkitt-like lymphoma (BLL) (32%) and Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma (BL) (19%) with 8q24 changes at diagnosis, was the most common. Nevertheless, 46% of cytogenetically characterized BL and BLL cases do not show 8q24 aberrations. On the other hand, 8q24 aberration was also often found in follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and low-grade NHL cases at progression. Cytogenetically, a de novo group is represented by classical t(8;14)(q24;q32) (n = 41), with isolated 8q24 changes, fewer secondary CG changes and represent mostly BL/BLL cases. In contrast, cases carrying variant 8q24 aberrations (n = 29) contain more CG events, carried primary 14q32 translocations, and included most FL, MCL and diffuse large B cell (DLBC) lymphoma cases. Clinically, the overall median follow-up was 8.6 months (range 0-192), with a median survival of 4.2 months from CG analysis. The presence of a 8q24 aberration give a statistically significant inferior prognosis than its absence in all histological groups, independent of clinical prognostic factors, when analyzed both at diagnosis and at relapse.

Twenty-one (16%) of the CLL/SLL patients had second malignancies (19 non-lymphoid, 1 Richter's transformation and 1 Hodgkin's disease), which were fatal in 15 (71%) patients. The SMR for the CLL/SLL population was 2.97 (95% CI 1.84-4.55) for second malignancy and 2.69 (95% CI 1.62-4.21) for non-lymphoid second malignancy. This study of a well-defined CLL/SLL population shows a significantly increased risk of second malignancy, which was the primary cause of death for 9% of all CLL/SLL patients (34% of all patient deaths).","['Kyasa, Mouhammed J', 'Hazlett, Linda', 'Parrish, Rudolph S', 'Schichman, Steven A', 'Zent, Clive S']","['Kyasa MJ', 'Hazlett L', 'Parrish RS', 'Schichman SA', 'Zent CS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*mortality', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', '*Veterans']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001612939 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Mar;45(3):507-13. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001612939.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 26 T cell receptor (TCR)-beta-chain subfamilies (VB) in 25 patients who underwent allo-SCT. Fifteen of these patients developed acute GVHD (aGVHD). Many TCR-VB were skewed in the early stage. In these TCR-VB subfamilies, VB6 was most often skewed at the time of skin aGVHD. We then analyzed the average score of the complexity of 26 TCR-VB spectratypings in patients with or without cGVHD. The patients who developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD) had a lower average score of TCR-VB complexity than that of patients without cGVHD (P = 0.010). In particular. the patients who developed the quiescent type and de novo type of cGVHD from 4 months after allo- SCT had a lower average score of TCR-VB complexity at 3 months than that of the patients who had no cGVHD (P = 0.0055).

Based on the genomic breakpoint in PML gene, three different PML/RARalpha isoforms are recognized: intron 3 [short (S)], intron 6 [long (L)] and exon 6 [variable (V)]. Studies on the prognostic significance of PML/RARalpha isoforms have reported contradictory results. This discrepancy may be related to differences in the treatment protocols, as some studies used ATRA alone during induction therapy. We analyzed the clinical course of 61 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of APL, treated with ATRA and chemotherapy at Princess Margaret Hospital from January 1994 to January 2002. The results of RT PCR at diagnosis were available on 48 patients. In this study, we report on clinico-biological features and prognostic significance of PML/RARalpha isoforms in these 48 patients. Of 48 patients, 19(40%) had the S isoform and 29 (60%) had the L/V isoform. Median white blood cell (WBC) count for patients with S isoform was 8.6 [interquartile range Q1-Q3 i.e. IQR 3.2-29] compared to 1.8 [IQR 1.0-4.9] for the L/V isoform group (P 0.001). No difference was seen in number of patients achieving of molecular remission after induction and consolidation treatment in the two-isoform groups. The patients with S isoform had significantly inferior relapse-free survival (RFS) at 3 years compared to L/V isoform patients [48% (95% C.I. 19 77) vs. 92% (95% C.I. 82-100), P0.006]. In a univariate analysis, S isoform status (P 0.006) and high WBC count ( > or = 5 x 10(9)+/l) (P 0.017) were significant prognostic factors for RFS. No difference in overall survival was seen between the two isoform groups (P 0.35). Our results suggest that based on molecular characterization, it may be possible to identify a subgroup of APL patients at higher-risk of relapse.","['Gupta, Vikas', 'Yib, Qi-Long', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Chun, Kathy', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Messner, Hans', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Wells, Richard A', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Kamel-Reidc, Suzanne']","['Gupta V', 'Yib QL', 'Brandwein J', 'Chun K', 'Lipton JH', 'Messner H', 'Schuh AC', 'Wells RA', 'Minden MD', 'Kamel-Reidc S']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Canada. vikas.gupta@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001617295 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Mar;45(3):469-80. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001617295.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include clinical stage, leukemic cell morphology, lymphocyte doubling time, the pattern of infiltration in bone marrow trephine biopsies, cytogenetic abnormalities, p53 function and serum factors such as beta-2 microglobulin. Two recently described major prognostic factors are immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) mutation status and cell membrane expression of CD38. These are both highly significant independent prognostic factors, but are not closely correlated. Whereas IgVH mutational status is a time consuming and demanding technique, only available in a limited number of centres, CD38 expression by flow cytometry is relatively simple and rapidly obtained in most diagnostic laboratories. The predictive value of CD38 expression is enhanced by measurement of antigen density in terms of antibody binding capacity (ABC) rather than as the percentage of cells expressing the antigen. ABC correlates closely with relative median fluorescence (RMF), a parameter which is even more simply and cheaply obtained by flow cytometry. One of these methods of determining CD38 expression should be employed routinely. Recent work suggests that membrane ZAP-70 expression determined by flow cytometry will prove to be an accurate proxy for IgVH mutational status and this assay will be within the reach of any laboratory skilled in flow cytometry. The combination of ZAP-70 expression, CD38 antigen density, p53 function and the concentration of serum factors such as soluble CD23, is likely to provide extremely accurate prognostic information in future studies. This will assist in identifying Stage A patients who may benfit from early and/or more intensive treatment, as well as Stage B and C patients who may require alternative treatment strategies at the outset.","['Mainou-Fowler, Tryfonia', 'Dignum, Helen M', 'Proctor, Stephen J', 'Summerfield, Geoffrey P']","['Mainou-Fowler T', 'Dignum HM', 'Proctor SJ', 'Summerfield GP']","['Haematological Sciences, School of Clinical and Laboratory Sciences, The Medical School, Leech Building, Farmington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.

CD34+ selection by immunomagnetic separation has been shown to be the most effective method to achieve a 3-4 log depletion of T-cells while preserving the high number of hematopoietic progenitors in the graft. The high number of CD34+ cells contained in the positive fraction have allowed to facilitate engraftment from sibling donors matched for only one haplotype. In addition, studies in pediatric recipients have shown that high numbers of hematopoiteic progenitors infused can lead to timely recovery of T- and B-cells in the first year after transplantation. Positive results have also been reported in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia who had received CD34+ selected PBSC from HLA-identical sibling donors and subsequent infusions of donor T-cells to establish graft-versus-leukemia effects. On the other hand, studies performed in adults with advanced leukemia receiving CD34+ selected PBSC from haploidentical or unrelated donors demonstrated an increased risk for graft-rejection, relapse and late opportunistic infections. Future efforts will have to concentrate on the restoration of cellular immunity by either adaptively transferring antigen specific effector cells or by studying the use of cytokines like interleukin-7. Although these question have not been resolved yet, allogeneic transplantation of highly purified CD34+ PBSC has become an therapeutic option for patients who are at high-risk for severe GvHD.","['Platzbecker, U', 'Ehninger, G', 'Bornhauser, M']","['Platzbecker U', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M']","['Med.

Once the survival of AA improved, observation of clonal evolution raised questions as to whether the development of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a part of the extended natural history of the disease or is related to the therapies applied. Clinical features of myelodysplasia and AA can overlap, and typical MDS may evolve as a complication of AA. Common pathophysiologic elements operate in these diseases and are subject to many studies and theories as to what mechanisms in AA may lead to the late evolution of MDS. Similarly, AA has been hypothesized to be a reflection of an over-reactive immune response triggered by the appearance of genetically altered and/or phenotypically abnormal dysplastic clones. Hypocellular variants of myelodysplasia and responsiveness of certain forms of MDS to immunosuppressive regimens serve as the most appealing examples of the intricate and close pathophysiologic relationship of this disease with AA. The diagnosis of clonal evolution in the course of AA can be obvious if secondary cytopenia involves hypercellularity and a high percentage of blasts. In addition, the occurrence of a new karyotypic defect objectively heralds the progression of disease to MDS. However, the diagnostic imprecision of dysplasia recognition in the context of marrow hypocellularity, inability to obtain informative cytogenetics, and a high proportion of MDS cases with normal karyoptype have hampered studies designed to determine the frequency and timing of MDS evolution in AA. In addition, the diagnostic criteria and definitions used are not unified. While some centers recognize that the abnormal karyotype does not preclude the diagnosis of AA; in others, the diagnosis of AA includes the presence of normal karyoptype. Many typical features of dysplastic evolution in AA have been clarified. For example, karyotypes most frequently encountered in MDS secondary to AA involve chromosomes 6, 7 and 8. The evolution rates seem to be in the range of 10-15% in 10 years, but there are no predictive clues as to which patients are at greatest risk for this complication. Study of the mechanisms of clonal evolution in AA may help understand the pathophysiology of other forms of MDS and leukemia and also the mechanisms of antileukemic surveillance. Clinically, identification of patients at increased risk for clonal complications may influence the choice of therapies applied.","['Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Selleri, Carmine']","['Maciejewski JP', 'Selleri C']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

It accounts for over one-third of all childhood cancers, most of which (approximately 75%) are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

A retrospective review of case notes was used to study all children with a diagnosis of acute leukemia from January 1993 to January 2003. All the cases were diagnosed using a bone marrow aspirate with morphological and immunophenotypic classification. Over this period, 24 cases relapsed. They were classified as per BFM group as ""very early,"" ""early,"" and ""late"" according to the time from diagnosis to first relapse and were divided into isolated bone marrow (BM), extramedullary site, and combined relapse. Sixteen percent of ALL cases and 58.6% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases so far relapsed. Most of the AML cases relapsed very early on in treatment. Eleven patients had combined relapse in BM and extramedullary site (9 in the central nervous system, 1 in the testicles, and 1 in the eye). The overall outcome of these patients is very poor, and only 6 patients out of 24 are still alive. In conclusion, the relapse rates of childhood AL are more or less similar to those of other reports but the overall outcome is very poor.

Future studies including genetic and molecular analysis may be able to explain the difference in clinical outcome of these relapsed AL cases.","['al Lamki, Zakia', 'Wali, Yasser A', 'Shah, Wasifuddin M', 'Zachariah, Mathew']","['al Lamki Z', 'Wali YA', 'Shah WM', 'Zachariah M']","['Department of Child Health, Haematology/Oncology Unit, College of Medicine, Sultan Qaboos University, PO Box 35, Al-Khod 123, Oman.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Testis/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880010490273127 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Mar;21(2):167-73. doi: 10.1080/08880010490273127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases should be differentiated from transient leukemoid reaction, which is noted in Down syndrome. Outcome in congenital leukemia is poor, but spontaneous remissions have been described. The authors report on a female neonate with myeloid leukemia of the skin; no blood and bone marrow involvement was noted. Constitutional 47, XX, + 21 was excluded. In situ hybridization on a paraffin-embedded skin biopsy sample did not show trisomy 21 in the leukemia lesions. No antileukemia therapy was given. During follow-up, small nodules (diameter up to 3 mm) on the soles of both feet came and went over a 3-month period. The child is now 3.5 years old and well. To date, 18 cases of congenital leukemia showing spontaneous remission have been described in the literature, almost exclusively myeloid leukemia (FAB M4 and M5). Congenital leukemia confined to the skin was described in only 4 cases. On follow-up, 6 cases relapsed; only one of them initially had skin involvement only. The data from this patient and literature indicate that cytostatic treatment should start only if the malignancy interferes with vital parameters. In case of relapse or progression, initial postponement of chemotherapy in these frail neonates will result in less toxicity and probably a better survival.","['van den Berg, Henk', 'Hopman, Anton H', 'Kraakman, Karlijn C', 'de Jong, Daphne']","['van den Berg H', 'Hopman AH', 'Kraakman KC', 'de Jong D']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children Hospital AMC, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, PO Box 22700, 1100DE Amsterdam, The Netherlands. h.vandenberg@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Foot', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*congenital/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mosaicism', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology']",56,2004/05/27 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/05/27 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/08880010490273000 [doi]', '9GKH96MD7AUCG7GR [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Mar;21(2):135-44. doi: 10.1080/08880010490273000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with hematologic malignancy (leukemia or stage III/IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma) who presented with fever and neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3) and patients with solid tumors who presented with fever and severe neutropenia (ANC < 100/mm3) were considered to be at high risk and eligible for this study. In this prospective study, 33 patients with 50 febrile neutropenic episodes received i.v. neropenem (20 mg/kg every 8 h) plus amikacin (15 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses) (in 31 episodes) or piperacillin/tazobactam (100 mg/4 mg/kg every 8 h) plus netilmicin (7 mg/kg every 24 h) (in 19 episodes). Clinical response was determined at 72 h and at completion of the therapy. The groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, initial ANC, use of growth factors, and classification of the infections. An infection was documented microbiologically in 12 episodes (39%) in the meropenem plus amikacin group and in 8 episodes (42%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam plus netilmicin group. Of the 22 microbiological isolates, 37% were gram-positives, 45% were gram-negatives, and 18% were fungi. Most of the clinically documented infections were of lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal mucosa, or urinary tract origin. The mean duration of neutropenia was 9 days in both groups. Fever persisted for 1-30 days (mean 3 vs. 5 days). The success rate with initial empiric therapy was 52% in the meropenem plus amikacin and 42% in the piperacillin/tazobactam plus netilmicin group, respectively (p = .5). Total success rate (with or without modification) was 97% vs. 90% in the episodes. Three patients died due to infection (1 vs. 2 patients). No major adverse effects were observed in each group.

The authors hypothesized that isolation of non-Candida fungi from blood cultures in patients undergoing high-risk HSCT would have clinical significance. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 73 allogeneic HSCT recipients between January 1, 1993 and January 1, 2001 in whom fungal species were isolated from blood cultures. RESULTS: Fifty-two episodes of non-Candida fungemia occurred in 48 patients (66%) after a median of 10 days (range, 2-341) after transplantation. All 48 patients had indwelling intravascular catheters, and 23 patients (48%) had profound neutropenia. Thirty-five of 48 patients had received partially matched, related donor stem cell grafts (19 patients had 3-antigen-mismatched grafts); 35 patients had undergone T-cell depleted transplantation and 9 patients were receiving treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease. In 5 of 48 patients (10%), death was attributed to fungemia that occurred 8-11 days after the initial fungal blood culture was obtained; all 5 patients were age > 30 years. No deaths occurred in the younger age group (n = 22 patients; P = 0.05). In the 24 patients who did not receive systemic antifungal therapy, 4 deaths (17%) were attributed to infections with Penicillium (n = 2 patients), Epicoccum (n = 1 patient), or Penicillium plus Cladosporium species (n = 1 patient). Of the 24 patients who received amphotericin B, only 1 patient (4%) died as a result of a probable hematogenous Aspergillus species infection; this difference in outcome, however, was not significant (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the non-Candida fungal blood culture isolates in recipients of high-risk, mismatched donor transplantation were clinically nonsignificant. However, because these low-virulence saprophytes occasionally may cause life-threatening disease, a reevaluation of the existing diagnostic paradigm is needed so that clinically significant fungemia may be differentiated from pseudofungemia.","['Safdar, Amar', 'Singhal, Seema', 'Mehta, Jayesh']","['Safdar A', 'Singhal S', 'Mehta J']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina, USA. asafdar@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladosporium/isolation & purification', 'Culture Techniques', 'Female', 'Fungemia/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Penicillium/isolation & purification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20262 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Jun 1;100(11):2456-61. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20262.,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Of 338 patients treated with imatinib (150 patients after interferon failure and 188 patients with newly diagnosed CML), 230 (68%) developed anemia. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with an increased probability of developing anemia were a starting hemoglobin level < 12 g/dL, age > or = 60 years, female gender, higher imatinib dose, and intermediate or high Sokal risk group. Of these 230 patients, 102 patients received treatment with 40,000 U of recombinant human erythropoietin administered subcutaneously once weekly. An increase in the hemoglobin level of > or = 2 g/dL was achieved in 69 patients (68%) and 22 patients (22%) had an increase of 1-1.9 g/dL. Patients who developed anemia had a trend toward a lower probability of complete cytogenetic remission compared with patients without anemia (68% vs. 77%; P = 0.14), as well as a trend for inferior survival.

We examined the suppressive activity of BWI-1 and BWI-2a against T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, such as JURKAT and CCRF-CEM, and human normal blood lymphocytes. Both inhibitors significantly suppressed the growth of T-ALL cells as judged by the soluble 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (tetrazolium/formazan assay). JURKAT cells showed slightly higher susceptibility to buckwheat inhibitors than CCRF-CEM cells. Modification of Arg residue(s) in inhibitors by 1,2-cyclohexandione inactivated their trypsin inhibitory activity, considerably abolishing their suppressive activity. This suggests that the trypsin inhibitory activity is involved in the suppression of growth of human T-ALL cell lines.

Two DNA pools were constructed, one of 444 AML cases, and another of 823 matched controls. The pools were validated using individual genotyping data for GSTP1 and LTalpha variants. Allele frequencies for variants in GSTP1 and LTalpha were estimated using quantitative AS PCR, and when compared to individual genotyping data, a high degree of concordance was seen. AS primer pairs were designed for nine candidate genetic variants in DNA repair and cell cycle/apoptotic regulatory genes, including Cyclin D1 [codon 870 splice site variant (A>G)]; BRCA1, P871L; ERCC2, K751Q; FAS -1377 (G>A); hMLH1 -93 (G>A) and V219I; p21, S31R; and the XRCC1 R194W and R399Q variants. For six of these assays, there was at least 95% concordance between AS PCR genotyping and an alternative approach carried out on individual samples. Furthermore, these six AS PCR assays all accurately estimated allele frequencies in the pools that had been calculated using individual genotyping data. A significant disease association was seen with AML for the -1377 variant in FAS (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.44). These data suggest that quantitative AS PCR can be used as an efficient screening technique for disease associations of genetic variants in DNA pools made from case-control studies.","['Rollinson, Sara', 'Allan, James M', 'Law, Graham R', 'Roddam, Philippa L', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Skibola, Christine', 'Smith, Alexandra G', 'Forrest, Matthew S', 'Sibley, Kathryn', 'Higuchi, Russell', 'Germer, Soren', 'Morgan, Gareth J']","['Rollinson S', 'Allan JM', 'Law GR', 'Roddam PL', 'Smith MT', 'Skibola C', 'Smith AG', 'Forrest MS', 'Sibley K', 'Higuchi R', 'Germer S', 'Morgan GJ']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/09/08 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/08 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['13/5/795 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 May;13(5):795-800.,,,,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphisms in the genes of folate metabolism enzymes have been associated with some forms of cancer. In a case-control study, we evaluated whether four common polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C), methionine synthase (MS A2756G), and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR A66G) genes may have a role in altering susceptibility to adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We analyzed DNA of 120 adult ALL, 200 NHL, and 257 healthy control subjects. Individual carrying the MTHFR 677TT genotype showed a 3.6-fold decreased ALL risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.12-0.72] than wild-types. Similarly, MS 2756GG individuals showed a 5.0-fold decreased ALL risk (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02-1.45) than wild-types. In combined results, subjects with the MTHFR 677CT/TT and MS 2756AG/GG genotypes revealed a 3.6-fold ALL risk reduction (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.58) and those with the MTHFR 677TT and MTRR 66AG genotypes revealed a 4.2-fold ALL risk reduction (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06-0.81). Finally, those with the MS 2756AG/GG and MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes revealed a 2.2-fold ALL risk reduction (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10-0.85). Single analysis for NHL did not show any significant difference for all the polymorphisms investigated, but in the low-grade NHL subgroup, we found a 2.0-fold risk reduction for the MTRR 66GG homozygous genotype (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25-0.99), which was higher (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.85) when analyzed in combination with MS 2756AA genotype.

Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is characterized by a block in differentiation at the promyelocyte stage. Here, we describe the effects of auranofin (AF), a coordinated gold compound, on apoptosis and differentiation of APL cells. 2. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation assay and Hoechst 33342 staining indicated that AF induced apoptosis in APL-derived NB4 cells at low concentrations (0.5-1.0 microm). The AF-induced apoptosis involved caspase-3 activation and specific cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase. 3. The AF-treated NB4 cells also produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cotreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine protected the NB4 cells from AF-induced apoptosis. 4. Expression of the CD11b cell surface marker and C/EBPepsilon was increased when the cells were treated for 4 days with 0.3 microm AF and a physiological concentration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 5 nm). Treatment with AF in combination with ATRA markedly increased the number of cells with differentiated features, such as lobed or multiple nuclei and numerous granules and vacuoles. At these low concentrations, neither AF nor ATRA alone induced significant cell differentiation. 5. These findings suggest not only that AF induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis via a mechanism involving ROS, but also that the combined treatment with AF and ATRA induces differentiation of NB4 cells. Our results demonstrate a novel characteristic of AF from which an effective drug treatment of APL might be developed.","['Kim, I S', 'Jin, J Y', 'Lee, I H', 'Park, S J']","['Kim IS', 'Jin JY', 'Lee IH', 'Park SJ']","['Department of Natural Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. ikim@catholic.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/drug effects/genetics', 'Antirheumatic Agents/adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Auranofin/*adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Benzimidazoles', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects', '*Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Nucleosomes/chemistry/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjp.0705708 [doi]', '0705708 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2004 Jun;142(4):749-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0705708.

Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia rarely are overtly malnourished, which makes this population ideal for an investigation of the relations between dietary antioxidant consumption, plasma antioxidant concentrations, and chemotherapy-induced toxicity. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of therapy on antioxidant intakes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the relation between dietary antioxidant intakes and plasma antioxidant concentrations, and the relation between the incidence of side effects due to treatment and antioxidant intake. DESIGN: We conducted a 6-mo observational study of 103 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma micronutrient concentrations, dietary intakes, and incidence of side effects of chemotherapy were ascertained at diagnosis and after 3 and 6 mo of therapy. RESULTS: Throughout the 6-mo study period, subjects ingested vitamin E, total carotenoid, beta-carotene, and vitamin A in amounts that were 66%, 30%, 59%, and 29%, respectively, of the US recommended dietary allowance or of the amounts specified in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Greater vitamin C intakes at 6 mo were associated with fewer therapy delays, less toxicity, and fewer days spent in the hospital. Greater vitamin E intakes at 3 mo were associated with a lower incidence of infection. Greater beta-carotene intakes at 6 mo were associated with a decreased risk of toxicity. CONCLUSION: A large percentage of children undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia have inadequate intakes of antioxidants and vitamin A. Lower intakes of antioxidants are associated with increases in the adverse side effects of chemotherapy.","['Kennedy, Deborah D', 'Tucker, Katherine L', 'Ladas, Elena D', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Blumberg, Jeffrey', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Kennedy DD', 'Tucker KL', 'Ladas ED', 'Rheingold SR', 'Blumberg J', 'Kelly KM']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antioxidants/*administration & dosage', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Medical Records', '*Nutritional Support', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Vitamin E/administration & dosage/blood']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcn/79.6.1029 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2004 Jun;79(6):1029-36. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/79.6.1029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple defective copies of the integrated provirus are often present in the host genome.

Here, we used overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to construct a full-length provirus of HTLV-I directly from an HTLV-I-transformed cell line, MT-2, which contains multiple defective proviruses. First, four overlapping proviral HTLV-I fragments (1.4-3.9 kb each) were constructed from genomic MT-2 DNA using PCR. Next, the complete HTLV-I proviral DNA (9 kb) was generated from these fragments using asymmetric PCR and cloned into a plasmid vector. 293 T cells transfected with this plasmid produced virus-like particles, and we show that these particles are capable of infecting a human T cell line.

AML-2/DX100 cells had more scavenging capacity against endogenous pro-oxidants than did the parental cells AML-2/WT, suggesting that an anti-oxidant adaptation against ROS occurred. cDNA microarrays for 8000 human genes revealed that among 21 anti-oxidant genes, each four gene was up- and down-regulated more than 1.5-fold in AML-2/DX100 compared with AML-2/WT.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of armepavines and atherosperminine on the cell survival rate and expression of bcl-2 and caspase-3 in CCRF-CEM cells. Our data have revealed that armepavine oxalate reduced the survival rate of CCRF-CEM cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner by MTT assay. However, no significant effects of armepavine MeI and atherosperminine N-oxide on the survival rate of the CCRF-CEM cell were observed. Armepavine oxalate-induced cell death was considered to be apoptotic on the basis of observed formation of the DNA ladder and the typical apoptotic morphological change by Hoechst 33258 staining. The expression of bcl-2 protein in CCRF-CEM cells treated with 30 microM armepavine oxalate was significantly decreased in western blotting analysis. In contrast, the expression of active caspase-3 in the cells was increased by armepavine oxalate in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate the involvement of bcl-2 and caspase-3 in the apoptotic process of CCRF-CEM cells induced by armepavine oxalate. The increased expression of active caspase-3 as well as decreased expression of bcl-2 support the assumption the armepavine oxalate-treated cells may be capable to complete the entire apoptotic process ending in cell fragmentation.","['Jow, Guey-Mei', 'Wu, Yang-Chang', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa', 'Teng, Che-Ming']","['Jow GM', 'Wu YC', 'Guh JH', 'Teng CM']","['School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, 510, Chung-Cheng Road, Hsin-Chuang, Taipei, Hsien, 242 Taiwan, ROC. nurs1019@mails.fju.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Oxalates)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5531-98-6 (atherospermine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RE6Z59021R (armepavine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*toxicity', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Oxalates', 'Phenanthrenes/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.lfs.2003.12.017 [doi]', 'S0024320504002693 [pii]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2004 Jun 18;75(5):549-57. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2003.12.017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous report, we found that in a sheep model, only CD5(-) B cells proliferated clonally, while CD5(+) B cells rapidly decreased when the disease progressed to the lymphoma stage. We demonstrate here that, although both CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells, but not CD4(+) T, CD8(+) T and gammadeltaTCR(+)T cells, are protected from spontaneous ex vivo apoptosis in sheep infected with wild-type and a mutant BLV that encodes a mutant Tax D247G protein with elevated trans-activation activity, only CD5(-) B cells become the main target for ex vivo survival when the disease proceeds to the persistent lymphocytotic stage, which showed an increased expansion of the CD5(-) B cells. In addition, we identified, by four-color flow cytometric analysis, that in CD5(-) B cells, the apoptotic rates of cells that expressed wild-type and mutant BLV were greatly decreased compared with those of BLV-negative cells. There was only a slight reduction in the apoptotic rates in BLV-positive cells from CD5(+) B cells. In addition, supernatants from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from wild-type- and mutant BLV-infected sheep mainly protected CD5(-) B cells from spontaneous apoptosis. Our results suggest that, although BLV can protect both CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells from ex vivo apoptosis, the mechanisms accounting for the ex vivo survival between these two B-cell subsets differ. Therefore, it appears that the phenotypic changes in cells that express CD5 at the lymphoma stage could result from a difference in susceptibility to apoptosis in CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells in BLV-infected sheep.","['Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Tajima, Shigeru', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Yin, Shan Ai', 'Okada, Kosuke', 'Davis, William C', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Takahashi M', 'Tajima S', 'Takeshima SN', 'Konnai S', 'Yin SA', 'Okada K', 'Davis WC', 'Aida Y']","['Retrovirus Research Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology/*virology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/physiopathology/*virology', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, pX', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/physiology/virology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis', 'Sheep']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2003/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.micinf.2004.02.014 [doi]', 'S1286457904000929 [pii]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2004 May;6(6):584-95. doi: 10.1016/j.micinf.2004.02.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, the participation of p70S6K in cell differentiation is not well understood. We have studied the response of p70S6K to the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in three differentiation-capable leukemic cell lines (MPD, AML-14 and HL-60) and in normal mature neutrophils. Immature leukemic cells starved for 16 h showed a robust ( approximately 3.5-fold over controls) p70S6K phosphorylation on T(421)/S(424) residues in response to an acute (5 min) 10 nM GM-CSF stimulation. On the other hand, cells that had been induced to differentiate and express granulocytic phenotypes, showed an increased ( approximately 6-fold) basal level of p70S6K T(421)/S(424) phosphorylation over immature cells, as well as an increased baseline tyrosyl phosphorylation of the GM-CSF receptor beta subunit (GM-CSF.Rbeta). However, the differentiated cells displayed a weak ( approximately 1.4-fold over controls) response to GM-CSF even at prolonged incubation times (20 min). In vitro p70S6K enzymatic activity paralleled p70S6K T(421)/S(424) phosphorylation in both high basal, unstimulated, levels in immature cells and a low degree of response to GM-CSF. Lastly, peripheral blood mature neutrophils had low basal GM-CSF.Rbeta and p70S6K activity, with both parameters being robustly stimulated following addition of GM-CSF, a situation in contrast with the cell lines, indicative perhaps of their incomplete terminal differentiation. In summary, these findings show the increase in basal phosphorylation of p70S6K upon granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells and their responses to GM-CSF that are closely paralleled with tyrosyl phosphorylation of its receptor, and help in pointing to specific cell signaling molecules that are different in leukemic blasts from normal leukocytes.","['Gomez-Cambronero, Julian', 'Frye, Tricia', 'Baumann, Michael']","['Gomez-Cambronero J', 'Frye T', 'Baumann M']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine, Wright State University, 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, Dayton, OH 45435, USA. julian.cambronero@wright.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neutrophils', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/*metabolism']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2003/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.11.012 [doi]', 'S0145212603004077 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Jul;28(7):755-62. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.11.012.,,,,,"['R01 HL056653/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056653-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 HL056653/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL056653/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC3082395,['NIHMS289535'],,,,,,,,

SU5416 is a small molecule inhibitor of VEGF receptors, c-kit and FLT3 and therefore provides a novel opportunity to target both angiogenesis and proliferation in AML. SU5416 was assessed in a phase II hematological malignancy trial in the US, where partial responses were observed in two of 33 patients. Since AML provides a unique platform to evaluate mechanism of action of small molecule inhibitors, investigation of the effect of SU5416 on FLT3 expression and phosphorylation in blood and bone marrow was an additional focus of this trial. Phosphorylated FLT3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis in peripheral blood samples from 17 of 22 patients, and seven exhibited strong inhibition of phosphorylation immediately following a 1h SU5416 infusion, demonstrating that SU5416 can modulate RTK phosphorylation in humans. Although no clear correlation with clinical response was observed, analysis of patient plasma drug levels suggested that a threshold SU5416 concentration of 15 microM was associated with FLT3 inhibition. This observation was supported by data from an ex vivo model where AML cells were spiked into human blood, established to mimic the clinical setting and enable more rigorous analysis of effect of SU5416. In addition, FLT3 protein levels were downregulated in patient bone marrow samples, analyzed by an RIA assay. To identify putative predictors of response, patient plasma was analyzed for levels of secreted ligands of SU5416 targets; SCF and FLT3 ligand. Baseline levels of SCF in patients with stable or progressive disease were significantly higher than those in normal donors, whereas FLT3 ligand levels in patients who exhibited progressive disease were significantly lower than those in normal donors.

Several garlic compounds including allicin and its corresponding sulfide inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of several human non-leukaemia malignant cells including breast, bladder, colorectal, hepatic, prostate cancer, lymphoma and skin tumour cell lines. Ajoene (4,5,9-trithiadodeca-1,6,11-triene-9-oxide) is a garlic-derived compound produced most efficiently from pure allicin and has the advantage of a greater chemical stability than allicin. Several clinical trials and in vitro studies of ajoene have demonstrated its best-known anti-thrombosis, anti-microbial and cholesterol lowering activities. Recently, topic application of ajoene has produced significant clinical response in patients with skin basal cell carcinoma. Ajoene was shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of several human leukaemia CD34-negative cells including HL-60, U937, HEL and OCIM-1. Also, ajoene induces 30% apoptosis in myeloblasts from chronic myeloid leukaemia patient in blast crisis. More significantly, ajoene profoundly enhanced the apoptotic effect of the two chemotherapeutic drugs: cytarabine and fludarabine in human CD34-positive resistant myeloid leukaemia cells through enhancing their bcl-2 inhibitory and caspase-3 activation activities. The two key anti-leukaemia biological actions of ajoene were the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. Studies have shown the anti-proliferation activity of ajoene to be associated with a block in the G2/M phase of cell cycle in human myeloid leukaemia cells. The apoptosis inducing activity of ajoene is via the mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade through a significant reduction of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 that results in release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3. Since acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignant disease in which disease progression at the level of CD34-positive cells has a major impact on resistance to chemotherapy and relapse and the inability to undergo apoptosis is a crucial mechanism of multi-drug resistance in AML patients. The recent findings of the potent enhancing activity of ajoene on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in CD34-positive resistant human myeloid leukaemia cells suggest a novel promising role for the treatment of refractory and/or relapsed AML patients as well as elderly AML patients. Further studies are warranted to evaluate similar enhancing effect for ajoene in blast cells from AML patients in primary cultures before its introduction in pilot clinical study.","['Hassan, H T']",['Hassan HT'],,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '99A0041VG8 (ajoene)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disulfides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', '*Garlic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfoxides']",66,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.10.008 [doi]', 'S0145212603003369 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Jul;28(7):667-71. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.10.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degradative activity finally results in cancer progression. MMP-inhibitors (MMPIs) have already been designed and tested, based on the degradative role of MMPs in cancer progression. First clinical trials with MMPIs have been performed with disappointing results, showing that in order to use MMP-inhibition the mechanisms underlying MMP-expression in cancer have to be further elucidated.

For patients who do not have an HLA-identical sibling, the treatment option is limited. Using related mismatch donors or parental donors for Allo-BMT was at high risk for acute severe GVHD. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of CD25 monoclonal antibody on reducing the incidence of severe acute GVHD in haploidentical bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of childhood leukemia. METHODS: Ten children with leukemia received haplotype Allo-BMT from HLA two or three loci mismatched related donors. Most patients were classified as in high risk category. The donors of patients were given G-CSF (Lenograstim Chugai) 250 microg/day for seven doses prior to marrow harvest. The non-T-cell depleted haploidentical bone marrow was infused. In addition to combination of CSA, MTX, ATG (Fresenius Hemocare, Germany) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for GVHD prophylaxis, CD(25) monoclonal antibody (Simulect, Novartis Pharma Switzerland) was administered to prevent acute severe GVHD.A total of 40 mg Simulect was given in two doses of 20 mg each by 30 min intravenous infusion 2 h before transplantation and day 4 after transplantation. The outcomes were compared with those of 8 children patients with leukemia who received haploidentical bone marrow transplantation without CD(25) antibody for GVHD prophylaxis. RESULTS: All patients were engrafted and sustained full donor-type engraftment. 100% donors hematopoietic cells after transplantation was determined by cytogenetic evidence analysis. The median days of granulocyte exceeding 0.5 x 10(9)/L and pallets exceeding 20 x 10(9)/L were 19 and 22 days, respectively. Patients were monitored till up to days 100 for the sign of aGVHD. None developed the grade II-IV acute GVHD. However, the incidence of the grade II-IV acute GVHD in control group was 50% (P = 0.0147). Eight patients could be evaluated for chronic GVHD. All experienced chronic GVHD confined to the skin. The median follow-up duration was 12 months (range 9 - 24 months). Two patients died from transplant related mortality, one had patient relapsed disease and died. The remaining seven patients were alive in disease-free situation. CONCLUSION: The use of Simulect in haploidentical bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of children patients with leukemia is effective for preventing acute severe GVHD and may reduce transplant-related mortality.","['Chen, Hui-ren', 'Ji, Shu-quan', 'Yan, Hong-min', 'Wang, Heng-xiang', 'Liu, Jing', 'Xue, Mei', 'Zhu, Ling']","['Chen HR', 'Ji SQ', 'Yan HM', 'Wang HX', 'Liu J', 'Xue M', 'Zhu L']","['Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of PLA Air Force, Beijing 100036, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2005/04/19 09:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2004 Apr;42(4):294-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we showed that infection of pig-tailed macaques with HTLV-I(ACH) is associated with multiple signs of disease characteristic of both HAM/TSP and ATL. We report here that within the first few weeks after HTLV-I(ACH) infection of pig-tailed macaques, serum concentrations of interferon (IFN)-alpha increased and interleukin-12 decreased transiently, levels of nitric oxide were elevated, and activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes and CD16(+) natural killer cells in peripheral blood were observed. HTLV-I(ACH) infection elicited virus-specific antibodies in all four animals within 4 to 6 weeks; however, Tax-specific lymphoproliferative responses were not detected until 25-29 weeks after infection in all four macaques. IFN-gamma production by peripheral blood cells stimulated with a Tax or Gag peptide was detected to varying degrees in all four animals by ELISPOT assay. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one animal that developed only a marginal antigen-specific cellular response were unresponsive to mitogen stimulation during the last few weeks preceding its death from a rapidly progressive disease syndrome associated with HTLV-I(ACH) infection of pig-tailed macaques. The results show that during the first few months after HTLV-I(ACH) infection, activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, limited virus-specific cellular responses, sustained immune system activation, and, in some cases, immunodeficiency were evident. Thus, this animal model might be valuable for understanding early stages of infection and causes of immune system dysregulation in HTLV-I-infected humans.","['McGinn, Therese M', 'Wei, Qing', 'Stallworth, Jackie', 'Fultz, Patricia N']","['McGinn TM', 'Wei Q', 'Stallworth J', 'Fultz PN']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294-2170, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/blood', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Interferon-alpha/blood', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/blood', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', '*Macaca nemestrina', 'Nitric Oxide/blood', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/virology']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/088922204323048195 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2004 Apr;20(4):443-56. doi: 10.1089/088922204323048195.,,,,,"['CA13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI27767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review aims to provide background and previous observations on the KIRs which are thought to influence the outcome of HSCT.","['Chen, Chun', 'Huang, Shao-Liang']","['Chen C', 'Huang SL']","['Center of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China. chenchun2002@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA-C Antigens/physiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",31,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2004)02-0236-08 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Apr;12(2):236-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An adult patient with acute myeloid leukemia received two units HLA one locus mismatched unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (2.5 x 10(7)/kg karyocytes in umbilical cord blood unit 1, and 1.53 x 10(7)/kg karyocytes in umbilical cord blood unit 2). Nine STR loci of the blood sample before and after transplantation were determined by quantitative detecting technique with fluorescence labeling polymerase chain reaction, while the engraftment and chimera types were qualitatively evaluated by comparing differential loci between the recipient and the donors. Then the relative proportion of chimera from two units of umbilical-cord blood in the patient after transplantation was calculated according to the differential gene peak areas of two donors on 377XL DNA sequencer after fluorescence scanning, and the engraftment level and the development rules of donor cells were analyzed. In addition, the results were also compared with that of HLA loci distinct analysis for engraftment. The results showed that two umbilical cord blood units at 15 days after transplantation were engrafted simultaneously and revealed a complete chimerism of the two. The relative amounts of chimera from unit 1 vs that of unit 2 were 51.3% vs 48.7%; subsequently relative amounts of chimera from unit 1 went up to 70.0% at 30 days, and that from unit 2 declined to 30.0%. However, at 52 days, only the genotype of umbilical cord blood unit 1 was detected, so that the engraftment turned to a complete chimerism of a single donor type. The one with fewer karyocytes was rejected and the one with more karyocytes finally engrafted in long-term. It is concluded that quantitatively detecting STR chimera with fluorescence labeling polymerase chain reaction can depict precisely the engraftment level and the change course of two umbilical cord blood units. It provides an accurate and reliable experimental basis for clinical umbilical cord blood application and donor selection, and is proved to be feasible for adult transplantation by using dual unit of umbilical-cord blood with HLA one locus mismatched at the same time.","['Zou, Hong-Yan', 'Li, Zhen', 'Deng, Zhi-Hui', 'Cheng, Liang-Hong', 'Wu, Guo-Guang']","['Zou HY', 'Li Z', 'Deng ZH', 'Cheng LH', 'Wu GG']","['Shenzhen Institude of Transfusion Medicine, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen 518035, China. yan6809@szonline.net']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (HLA-B Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation Chimera']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/09/17 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2004)02-0179-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Apr;12(2):179-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum extent of PLT aggregation and size of the aggregates were compared between PLT in stored PC before transfusion with the PLT-rich plasma (PRP) from the recipients after transfusion and with PRP from patients with moderate decrease in PLT counts after chemotherapy. RESULTS: The maximum extent of PLT aggregation was significantly higher in PRP collected from the patients after transfusion compared to the extent obtained before transfusion. There were no significant differences in the maximum extents of PLT aggregation between the PRP collected from the recipients after PC transfusion and, in the same patients, when PLT counts were moderately low. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the observed decreased in PLT aggregation after storage can improve in the body after transfusion, and transfused PLTs have similar aggregation ability compared to the PLTs derived from the patient.","['Miyaji, Ryosuke', 'Sakai, Michio', 'Urano, Hajime', 'Nakata, Koichi', 'Sakamoto, Hisahi', 'Shirahata, Akira']","['Miyaji R', 'Sakai M', 'Urano H', 'Nakata K', 'Sakamoto H', 'Shirahata A']","['Department of Pediatrics and Transfusion Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan. mryosuke@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Blood Preservation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/blood/complications/drug therapy', '*Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Recovery of Function', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/chemically induced/therapy', 'Time Factors']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03214.x [doi]', 'TRF03214 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2004 Jun;44(6):891-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03214.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 57.8 months, therapeutic phlebotomy (mean number of units collected, 36.6) was effective in reducing mean ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation from 1726.9 to 93.0 mg per L and from 54.7 to 23.3 percent, respectively. The presence of a HH gene mutation did not influence initial iron status or response to treatment. The phlebotomy program was well tolerated and no adverse events were recorded during or after collection. In three cases the time between phlebotomies was increased because of patient's poor compliance or low Hb levels. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that phlebotomies are a safe and effective method for reducing iron over-load in multiply transfused long-term AL survivors with secondary hemochromatosis.","['Franchini, Massimo', 'Gandini, Giorgio', 'Veneri, Dino', 'de Matteis, Giovanna', 'Federici, Francesca', 'Solero, Pietro', 'Aprili, Giuseppe']","['Franchini M', 'Gandini G', 'Veneri D', 'de Matteis G', 'Federici F', 'Solero P', 'Aprili G']","['Immunhematology and Transfusion Service, Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy. massimo.franchini@mail.azosp.vr.it']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemochromatosis/complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/epidemiology/etiology/*therapy', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Compliance', '*Phlebotomy/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Safety', '*Survivors', 'Transferrin/analysis', '*Transfusion Reaction']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03264.x [doi]', 'TRF03264 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2004 Jun;44(6):833-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03264.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to low availability of type-specific SDPs, transfusion services sometimes issue ABO-mismatched PLTs. After observing two cases of acute hemolysis following infusion of O SDPs to group A patients, where both recipient eluates revealed anti-A specificity, a prospective study to determine the prevalence of ""high-titer"" anti-A/A,B in group O SDPs was commenced. One hundred group O SDP samples were tested. Titers of at least 64 and/or 256 from either buffered (generally reflective of IgM antibodies) or anti-IgG gel cards, respectively, were considered critically high. Twenty-eight and 39 percent of samples revealed critically high anti-A/A,B IgM and IgG titers, respectively. IgM titers were at 1:64 (18%), 128 (6%), and 256 (4%), whereas IgG titers were at 1:256 (28%), 512 (7%), 1024 (2%), and 2048 (2%). The prevalence of critical anti-A/A,B titers in group O SDPs is relatively high. Thus, the risk of minor side ABO mismatch and potential intravascular hemolysis during group O SDP transfusion to group A recipients may be significant. Based on these data, a policy was instituted to test anti-A/A,B titers in O SDPs prior to ""out-of-group"" transfusion.","['Josephson, C D', 'Mullis, N C', 'Van Demark, C', 'Hillyer, C D']","['Josephson CD', 'Mullis NC', 'Van Demark C', 'Hillyer CD']","['Transfusion Medicine Program, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. cjoseph@emory.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*analysis/immunology', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Blood Preservation', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Hemagglutinins/*blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Organizational Policy', 'Plasma/immunology', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects/economics', '*Plateletpheresis', 'Risk']",,2004/05/26 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03290.x [doi]', 'TRF03290 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2004 Jun;44(6):805-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03290.x.,,,,,,,,['Transfusion. 2004 Jun;44(6):802-4.

At present we know that the involvement of mitochondria is regulated by proteins of the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2) family, which biochemically act by altering the properties of mitochondrial membranes to facilitate the release of apoptogenic proteins like cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo that, once released into the cytosol, are crucial for activating the caspase cascade of cell degradation. The precise mechanism of the pro-apoptotic action is not fully understood yet, but could be clarified in the near future. Instrumental to this clarification is the emerging evidence that CL (cardiolipin), an unusual membrane lipid that is predominantly present in mitochondria, is required for the action of major pro-apoptotic proteins like Bid and Bax. New results obtained in myeloid cells further sustain this possibility and suggest that Bid may be involved in the metabolic cycle of CL re-modelling. In agreement with this postulate, preliminary results indicate a down-regulation of Bid in parallel to the genetic deficiency in CL re-modelling that is associated with a rare human disease, 'Barth Syndrome'. Intriguingly, this disease is characterized by neutropenia, suggesting a link between myeloid differentiation and cell death (and myeloid lymphoma pathogenesis too). I will project current results and trends towards future investigations on the involvement of CL and mitochondrial membranes in myeloid differentiation, cell death and disease.","['Degli Esposti, M']",['Degli Esposti M'],"['School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Stopford Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PT, UK. mauro.esposti@man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Cardiolipins/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",17,2004/05/26 05:00,2005/01/13 09:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BST0320493 [doi]', 'BST0320493 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2004 Jun;32(Pt3):493-5. doi: 10.1042/BST0320493.,,['Copyright 2004 Biochemical Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the lifespan of these cells can be extended at an inflammatory locus through interaction with survival factors. Although a wide variety of factors can modulate granulocyte survival, they often utilize a common subset of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated that the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) family of lipid kinases may be critical in regulating the ability of granulocytes to survive at inflammatory loci. Studies utilizing both pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and isoform-specific knockout mice have demonstrated that this enzyme is needed for the anti-apoptotic effects of granulocyte survival factors. More recently, a serine/threonine protein kinase, termed protein kinase B (also known as c-akt), has been demonstrated to be important in modulating the prosurvival effects of PI3K activation. This can occur through modulation of the expression or phosphorylation of members of the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2) family of apoptosis regulators. This review summarizes recent results that have implicated a role for PI3K in regulating granulocyte survival.","['Lindemans, C A', 'Coffer, P J']","['Lindemans CA', 'Coffer PJ']","['Department of Pulmonary Diseases, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wortmannin']",49,2004/05/26 05:00,2005/01/13 09:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BST0320480 [doi]', 'BST0320480 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2004 Jun;32(Pt3):480-4. doi: 10.1042/BST0320480.,,['Copyright 2004 Biochemical Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
